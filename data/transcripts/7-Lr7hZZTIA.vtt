working on our Western and then
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
underneath from a management structure
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
we have our director of territory
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
operations and they can be responsible
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
for several States
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
and Victor is one of Esperanza is our
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
director of territory operations that
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
covers New Hampshire for example and
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
these guys know Victor and then within
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
we have territory managers that run
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
specific districts or the day-to-day
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
operations of of the propane we've sort
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
of heard that propane really is just
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
taking gas from a big tank and putting
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
it into a smaller tank sometimes it can
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
be challenging to do that but that's
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
really what we do and as well as
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
servicing our customers
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
several years ago pre-covet we did
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
change our sort of business model a
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
little bit looking to go more online we
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
were seeing more of our customers wanted
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
to go online and deal with us
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
electronically and so we did go away
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
from what I think has been historically
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
a traditional propane District model
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
where your manager and the customer
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
relations representative is sitting in
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
the district we centralized our
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
operations and so now we have
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
centralized distributions centralized
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
procurement as well as our call centers
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we have a couple of call centers
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
around the country that when a customer
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
calls in it's one number they reach a
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
trained customer experience agent and we
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
have a customer relations management
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
system that allows them to go in and so
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
any agent can answer a phone call from
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
any customer across the company
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
while that sounds very easy it was
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
challenging in 2019 to go through that
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
experience while we were setting up
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
those call centers during covid and then
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
as we were sort of coming out of it in
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
2021 2022 sort of hit us a little bit
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
more and we have been having I think
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
like others in the industry and outside
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
the industry some staffing shortages so
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
we were having driver shortages we were
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
having service tech shortages not just
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but company-wide and we
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
were also bringing on new employees so
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
whereas a lot of employees have been in
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
the propane business for 10 20 and 30
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
years we were seeing on the good side we
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
were seeing new people coming to the
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
propane industry which was always good
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
but I mean if I may end up I I do have
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
one question going back to your
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
statement about you went to a more of an
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
online business now in
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
particularly in New England but
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire we have an
 
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
older population and where people are
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
located in more rural areas I'm sure
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're using outdoor propane tanks
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
most of those people are not in their
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
20s or 30s so was there any problem with
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
when you went to a more of an online
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
business model do do they know
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
how to get in contact with you because
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
even though they they may have a
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
computer maybe they're not they're not
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
used to going online for things like
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm just kind of interested
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
because that might be a might be one
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
issue that we may not even know about
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
about online type of stuff so I don't
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
have our specific customer breakdown of
 
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
unless you know of online versus
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but they're still the traditional
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's still a 1 800 number that you can
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
pick up and call and you will get a live
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
person and so the what if you were a
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
propane customer from five years ago for
 
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
example and you had the number to your
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
local district office that number now
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
automatically rolls in so even if you
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
were dialing an old number it's going to
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
roll into the 1-800 number that is still
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
going to get you a live person you do
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
not need to be online in any way to do
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
business with AmeriGas if you would
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
prefer to have your statement mailed to
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
you to call in and be if you're a will
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
call customer call to make your order
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's has stayed the same or
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
you even if you want to do a little bit
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
of a blend you can do a little bit
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
online but still do a little bit over
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
the phone that still exists or if you
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to do completely online customers
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
so so sort of moving forward oh and what
 
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
I handed you is again sort of a customer
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
fact sheet that shows our current
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
customers in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and our district offices where they
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
serve out so where the bobtails come in
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
they'll pick up the gas and they go out
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
and make deliveries and then the packet
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
what I gave you is our new customer
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
welcome packet so every customer when
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
they become a customer of AmeriGas will
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
get this packet and it includes our
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions which is basically
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
the same version of our residential
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
customer agreement that a customer could
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
sign online or they can do it we would
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
mail it out to the customer if they
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
didn't want the online experience it
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
would we would mail it out to the
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
customer they could sign it and send it
 
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
customer they could sign it and send it
back

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
and and then again the t's and C's that
 
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
are in there is basically the same as
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
the residential agreement so what that
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
that lays out is the relationship
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
between the company and the customer so
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
in those t's and C's we do disclose you
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
know how the uh what is the cut what is
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
customer equipment what is Amerigas
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
equipment what our fees and charges are
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
so the customer can see that before they
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
become a customer of AmeriGas and those
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions have been online at
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
least since 2012 that I know of for sure
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
but probably
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
um even before that so if a customer is
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
looking at do it shopping around they
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
can go online to amerigasa's website and
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
all of that is available online for them
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
to see what the charges would be if they
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
were to become a customer
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
so that's what's in front of you then um
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
just to go back
 
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
um again this this particular year
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't ever want any
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
customer to find it difficult to get in
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
touch with us that's why we wanted to
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
shift our our model so that that anybody
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
um any customer could call at any time
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
and get a live person and they can walk
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
them through and and help them deal with
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted a delivery whether
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
they had a service issue they didn't
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
understand something on the bill that
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
really was the goal and the aim of what
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
we were trying to do and have very
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
systematic training so that every
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
customer had the same experience so this
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
year in particular we we know that we
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
had some issues coming with our call
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
centers and so we've been really
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
training our call centers to be able to
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
do two primary things one is to answer
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
the phone as quickly as they can
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
um that is actually the easy part then a
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
little more challenging is to answer the
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
customer with what they need with one
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
call resolution and then if they're not
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
where we've seen there has been a little
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a breakdown is is following up
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
reaching back out to the customer making
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure you were resolving that customer
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
issue so they don't have to call
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
multiple times so what we've been doing
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
to immediately deal with that issue is
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
in particular when we when we heard a
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
little bit more about this one is we
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
created a specific call queue for New
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so customers in New Hampshire
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
right now are calling in to only our
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
senior level cxa agents at the moment
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
cxa is customer experience agent and
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're going through and so they have we
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
upgraded the scripts the telephone
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
scripts to make sure they had more
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
information to better be able to answer
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
the customers questions and really get
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
to that one call resolution
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
we also looked at and our our primary
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
goal during the winter is always
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
delivery excuse me
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
so we have had some of our service tax
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
that normally we do tank pickups for
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
example or other routine service work
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
they are in bobtails making deliveries
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
so some of our service work we did see
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
began to lag behind what we would even
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
consider acceptable levels so we did see
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
that tank pickups did lag behind so in
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
working with our service department we
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
have now engaged a third party vendor to
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
assist us in picking up any outstanding
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
tanks that needs to be picked up and we
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
changed we know specifically there has
 
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:04.670 align:start position:0%
changed we know specifically there has
been

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.569 align:start position:0%
been
um

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
we needed to clarify our policy on
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
underground tanks and we've historically
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
had because a lot of our customers who
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
have underground tanks or acquisition
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
customers our company has really grown
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
through buying other companies and
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
growing through Acquisitions and Records
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't always transfer easily so we may
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
not get a customer file from someone who
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
is a customer of Michelle's propane from
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
20 years ago so we don't know what the
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
original Arrangement was with an
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
underground tank
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
so we put in our T's and C's which have
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
been there for a while that if you have
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
an underground tank it is a customer's
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pay for the removal we
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
know and that we generally were not
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
selling our underground tank because
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
steel is an asset for us but we've now
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
changed that policy in New Hampshire so
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
I believe we have 26 tanks underground
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
tanks that need to be picked up what
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is negotiate
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
individually with the customers and sell
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
them the underground tank so that there
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a disruption to the
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
property but if they don't want to buy
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
the tank we will go ahead once the
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
weather permitting and pick it up for me
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
I have a question at this point could
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
you go into a little more I I might know
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
the answer but could you go into a
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
little more detail on
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
the underground tanks and why you do
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
what you do and why don't you just take
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
them over and uh without any issues and
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:30.530 align:start position:0%
and things like that
uh

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
well I'll explain sort of then I don't
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
know if you want to jump in sorry unless
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative could you clarify the
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
question exactly what are you looking
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
for on the Underground well uh there's
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
the statement that you made that you
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
that you did some changes
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and that you're not you're going to
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
sell sell the underground tanks back to
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
the customer uh but issues uh about uh
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
transfer or
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
or buying and selling the tanks what
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
what goes into that why why
 
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
what goes into that why why
um

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
I got uh why is it more difficult than
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
just a simple buy and sell transfer or
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
why even sell them why don't you just
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
keep on using them
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
so okay I'll do my best to answer that
 
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.730 align:start position:0%
so okay I'll do my best to answer that
question

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
so a lot to unpack there but
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
um so underground assets as my
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues behind me uh no I mean that's
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's there's a lot of effort and time
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
that goes into putting in those
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
particular assets and typically once a
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
customer has that asset the last thing
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
they want to be doing is digging up
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
their property so in the past and
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
certainly in current situations even
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
today if a customer calls uh and they
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
want to exit business with AmeriGas or
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
even our counterparts if there's nothing
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
we can absolutely do to cure that
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
relationship with that customer what
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
we'll typically offer an opportunity for
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
them to either buy that asset we may
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
exchange an asset an underground tank
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
with with our with our competitors
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's here in New Hampshire or
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
anywhere for that matter or if push
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
comes to shove we can certainly work
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
with customer to remove that asset
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and and either have somebody else
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
another underground asset or they may
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
choose to go above ground but the
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
underground asset is is certainly a more
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
complex installation versus a typical
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
residential installation where you might
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
have a vertical dot a tank across this
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
next to the house a 500 gallon of above
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
ground that's outside the house and in
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
this part of the country which I was
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
raised in in this industry this time of
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
year is very difficult as well sometimes
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
to pull those out although it is 50
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
degrees here today you know there are
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
times certainly when I started this
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
business in 98 that those tanks would be
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
frozen for for the entire winter so you
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
would work with the customer uh if they
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
so choose to want to take their business
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we would make arrangements to
 
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
remove that asset once the winter season
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
was over does that answer your question
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
or did I well as as a follow-up
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll ask a question this way uh I
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
have an underground tank
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
it came with the house
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 17 18 years old
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's say there's an issue with the tank
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
some I don't know what what could be
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
going wrong but let's say there's an
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
issue with the tank
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
my gas company comes I assume I call
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
them they come to fix it
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
do I pay for it
 
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.789 align:start position:0%
do I pay for it
is

00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
it they assumed they they assumed
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
ownership of the tank when I when I
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
purchased the home it was a new home at
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
the time it was a 18 months old the tank
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
originally belonged to Eastern uh I
 
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
wanted Palmer Gas as my own
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
um and uh Palmer says yeah you're a
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
great customer we knew you in Salem we
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
sold your oil we'll sell you gas here
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
and they said that they would take over
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
ownership of the tank as far as I know
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
never had to look into it after that it
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
was like a transparent transfer no
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
issues so my assumption is that they
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
took over ownership of the tank yeah so
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
what I would say is generally speaking
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
um if it is a tank that is owned by the
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
company repairs that pertain to the tank
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
are sort of piping even probably up to
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
the second stage regulator the company
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
would take care of generally speaking
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you oh take my question and this
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
is actually a follow-up on that I have
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
an underground tank as well but I
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
noticed we looked at the bill the
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
complaints we were having some of them
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
were the fact of uh
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
when they had complaints with their gas
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
company they were told that they can
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
shop around in fact we heard that today
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can they can shop around
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
but if they have an in-ground tank like
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
myself so if I'm upset with my vendor
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I have there in the green ground
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
tank that was built in most of the new
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire are getting in
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
ground tanks and I wanted to switch to
 
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.669 align:start position:0%
ground tanks and I wanted to switch to
Amerigas

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
Amerigas
 
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:44.390 align:start position:0%
Amerigas
um

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
they own it what's the what's involved
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
in transferring it do I have to pay to
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
have so just to change companies do I
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
need to pay for the a brand new tank do
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
I need to pay for the digging up of the
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
one I have now what's involved for me
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
and what I'm going to say is generally
 
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
speaking first it would be whatever was
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
in if if you had an original contract so
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
if let's say for example that you became
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use AmeriGas you became an
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas customer you have a new home
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
you want an underground tank for
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
aesthetic or other reasons we would have
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
a contract with you saying okay it's
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to be an AmeriGas take AmeriGas is
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to put it in the ground these are
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
the charges that would go with that and
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
then there would be a provision that
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
would say and if you wanted to if you
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
were to leave this is what it would cost
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
to either have the tank dug up or if
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
there was an opportunity for the sale of
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
tank you wanted to buy the tank because
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
if you own your tank generally you can
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
shop around and have anyone fill that
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
tank the homeowner then would be
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
responsible for the maintenance on the
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
take unless you otherwise contracted out
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
for it what I see in the industry and
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
again we'll turn over if what I see is
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
not other people's experience but the
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
customer generally may not have that
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
original contract or maybe there wasn't
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
even an original contract to begin with
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
OR you bought the house from a developer
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
and the developer had a relationship
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
with the company and there's no
 
00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
with the company and there's no
documentation

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
and so now you're stuck with node with
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
no documentation what what we were
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
looking at we still try and find that
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
documentation so we'll look to see like
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
did you pay tank rent at any time we try
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
and uncover who owned the tank and then
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
we try and resolve it on a case-by-case
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
basis because it is expensive to dig up
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
the tank resurface a fail there could be
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
damage to
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a heavy crane that sort of comes
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
in and so we really the propane
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
companies generally don't want to dig up
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
the tank we want to leave the tank in
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
the ground so it can be an arrangement
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
with another propane company you can
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
have that sort of conversation obviously
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
we're going to try and keep the customer
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
as much as we can we don't want them to
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
leave but I don't think there's a a
 
00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.430 align:start position:0%
leave but I don't think there's a a
specific

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
industry on how it's done I think it can
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
be Case by case but what AmeriGas tried
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
to do to help clarify that since we had
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
so many acquisition customers was put in
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
our terms and conditions if you had an
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
underground tank and you wanted to leave
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas it was the customer's
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility if they wanted to if
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas wasn't going to buy the tank or
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
sell the tank to the customer that that
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
it would be the customer's
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to dig up the tank and
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
that is where what I would say
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
specifically here in New Hampshire
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
because we've had a shortage of our
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
service tax and because some of those
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
service techs have been in bobtails we
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
have been behind although we haven't
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
been immediately offering to sell the
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
tank to the customer we also haven't
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
come out to dig it up and that's where
 
00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:35.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
as mentioned prior is there may be
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
another scenario
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
um it's your you know you we own the
 
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.049 align:start position:0%
um it's your you know you we own the
tank

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
tank
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
um the relationship is so damaged that
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
you are very incentivized to to break
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
that relationship you may reach out to
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
an Eastern Sierra they can contact us
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we have historically not just here
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire in the
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
industry in general we can swap the tank
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
so they can bring us an asset like to
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
like asset
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so the competitor would still own
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
your tank we would transfer ownership of
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
that take ownership of a new underground
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
tank into our yard for use with another
 
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.169 align:start position:0%
tank into our yard for use with another
customer

00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
the gay representative votes has a
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
question but before uh in those we want
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
example 500 gallon underground tank
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
because the tank is the tanks the tank
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
all tanks the same
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
well it's no they're not all the same
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
and they're not all called the same
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
depending on where you live uh in the in
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
um but a 500 gallon any underground
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
asset is going to be more expensive
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
typically than the same size of an above
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
ground asset
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
um so you have that aspect of it there
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
are other safety requirements that come
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
with an underground tank there's
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
cathodic protection checks that's
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the supplier to provide
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh for you as a as a customer so there's
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's variables in that and then
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
undergrounds can range anywhere from 100
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
gallon underground tank we have a lot of
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
those in the State of Florida and then
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
obviously where we have higher usage
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
here in new New England a typical
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
underground is a 500 or a thousand
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
gallon tank so you have tall risers I
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
mean the the refill point in the tank
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's shorter risers
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
um and various size and uh forms and
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you following along this line of
 
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
thank you following along this line of
questioning

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
is it possible to standardize the
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
process for
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of a tank from one
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
vendor to another
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
I've changed propane vendors four times
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
in the 16 years I've lived in my house
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
and each time the process for changing
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
ownership of the tank has been different
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
and from a customer point of view I
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
think that's that's confusing
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
it can sometimes be daunting to the
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
point where someone would would
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
not change vendors because of the
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty of exchanging the tank
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
so my question for you guys is
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
would it require legislation to set up a
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
standard process or is that something
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
that the industry would take on
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
second I'm going to speak for AmeriGas I
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
would say that is something that
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we would want the industry to
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
take on I know we have a lot of
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
gentlemen's agreements that we would
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
work through
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and so that it's clear but that's why
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
America's puts that in our terms and
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
conditions so you know what it would
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
what you would have to do if a customer
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave us they know at the time
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
of Contracting what our terms are and
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
what they would have to pay if they
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
would want to leave AmeriGas so we feel
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
we've already provided that within our
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions but I think to
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
again speaking for AmeriGas but then
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
speaking for the industry I think will
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
be something the industry would would
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
like to tackle first before seeing
 
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.710 align:start position:0%
like to tackle first before seeing
legislation

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just going to ask a follow-up
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
question because as I indicated before
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
I've changed vendors four times I've
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
never received a contract from any of
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
the vendors to whom I have
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
changed or from whom I left
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
so I have no idea at this point in time
 
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.430 align:start position:0%
so I have no idea at this point in time
what

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
my status is with regard to my tank
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm happy that the company comes and
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
fills it up periodically but beyond that
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
I I know nothing about my tank
 
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.090 align:start position:0%
I I know nothing about my tank
um

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
I don't get charged a rental fee
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
but I do get charged a what they call a
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
safety fee every time they fill up my
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
tank and I have a question about that
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
for you later on but um my point here is
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
just to point out that
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
written agreement
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm familiar with I've done
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
business with
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
Eastern Propane with Suburban Propane
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
with Townsend energy they're my current
 
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.250 align:start position:0%
with Townsend energy they're my current
supplier

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
and with one other company whose name
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten already but um and I've
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
Leslie but I would I would still say we
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
would rather tackle that as an industry
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
which we can easily do here in New
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and with the assistance of
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
of the trade Association as opposed to
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
having legislation I also think this is
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
where companies again now with a lot of
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
the online even though there is a larger
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
population is sending out that sort of
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
material getting contracts it makes a
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
relationship much more clear with the
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
customer so they know what the rights
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities are
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative minority has a question
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
so following up in the same line
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
we need to know how Divergent your terms
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
and conditions are from everybody else's
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
because it seems that everybody's got a
 
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.049 align:start position:0%
because it seems that everybody's got a
different

00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
way they play in the sandbox and and
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's the problem we need to have
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
something more standardized and uniform
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know if if I have fuel oil and I
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
want to change a fuel oil distributor
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
not not a problem right but here it's
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
the tank it's the connection it's I mean
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts is there a contract is
 
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
there not a contract I've had lived in
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
the same home that I built 22 years ago
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
I never had a contract
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
no idea about a contract with an
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
underground tank
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be I guess what you're
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
hearing from us is standardized way of
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
the way you're going to do business so
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
people understand it plainly and clearly
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
is everybody going to have a contract
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
how's it going to work
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
how are you going to be able to change
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
from vendor to vendor if you want or
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh you could you could answer an hour or
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
you can answer later what would you
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
prefer okay cool
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question my name is
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
Leslie Anderson I am in charge of the
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
propane gas Association of New England
 
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.730 align:start position:0%
propane gas Association of New England
and

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.169 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
there are different terms throughout the
 
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.250 align:start position:0%
there are different terms throughout the
industry

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
um our industry is is made of companies
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
like AmeriGas that's the biggest in the
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
industry you know they're in all 50
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
states and then we have small
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
family-owned you know David Richard is
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
here he's not the small my typical small
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'd say a medium-sized company you know
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
that's family owned that's here but the
 
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:45.500 align:start position:0%
the companies offer different things
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
some companies offer 24-hour service if
 
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
your you know system goes down the
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
middle of the night they have somebody
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's going to be there in 30 minutes
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
to get it started and start working on
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
fixing it for you other companies don't
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
offer service you know and they might
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
have a lower price per gallon because
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
they have less overhead but there's a
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
wide variety of businesses out there and
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
it they also have different fees
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of customer how
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
many gallons they use the more propane
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
you use the less you pay per price per
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
gallon it's just like milk you know if
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
you buy a small thing of milk it costs
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
more per volume than it does if you buy
 
00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:26.779 align:start position:0%
a gallon of milk at the grocery store
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
and if you're just using propane for a
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
generator you might have a minimum use
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
fee or a tank rental or tank usage fee
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay because you know on
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
a year like this you might only have
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
that generator running just for its
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
safety checks and and just for a day
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
during the year when the power goes out
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
and the company has got at least two
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
tanks there for a generator which is a
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
15 to 2500 asset that they are providing
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
at their expense that they are insuring
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
you know at their expense so the
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
homeowner doesn't have to and they have
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
to make up the cost of those tanks and
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
normally it's done in the price per
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
gallon some companies put all of their
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
fees into the price per gallon other
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
companies break it out and they say like
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
for a generator is a good example if you
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
only use 250 gallons you're going to
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
have to pay if you use less than that
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay a minimum use fee
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
for example and this number might vary
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the on the company and the
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
size of your tanks but if you go over
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
that that year then we're not going to
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
charge you a minimum use fee that year
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
because you're going to make it up in
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
your gallon age that you buy you know
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
and that's to the customer's benefit in
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
that case because if they didn't have
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
that they'd probably have to charge a
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
rental fee for those and you'd pay for
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
it every year whether you used a certain
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
amount or not
 
00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
um so there's there is a wide variety
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
and the law that governs it first and
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
foremost is you know under the the UCC
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
your contract that you have with the
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
propane supplier if you don't have a
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
contract you know we we could say
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
everybody has to have a contract but in
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
a case like that then you're locking
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
people into contracts too so if you
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a contract in place and
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
you're not happy with the company that
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
you have then you should be able to
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
change to another company and I know
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
there was an issue here I listened to
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
the testimony when you guys beat Bob up
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
on that meeting that was saying it's
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
there and I apologize that I wasn't here
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
for that I cover Six States and I had a
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
big dinner meeting in in Massachusetts
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
that night that I had to be at but
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
I was like talking about um the
 
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.190 align:start position:0%
I was like talking about um the
uh

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes but I'll offer to help
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
customers if they call them we have a
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
relationship with the AG's office and
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection group here and
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
they actually refer complaints that come
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
in to our office first and we reach out
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
to members of the propane industry
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to be you know
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
here having to testify against questions
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
that have come up we want to resolve
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
everything we want to have good customer
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
service as an industry so when I heard
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
the the testimony and and talked with
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
Bob I the next week I was at a meeting
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
with Michelle who runs uh the legal
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
department at AmeriGas and I said we
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
have got you guys have got a big problem
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire how can we fix that you
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
know we have got to address this and
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds also like we need to make sure
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
that we are transferring takes in a
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
timely manner between companies when
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
people have underground tanks and they
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
want to change suppliers it's easier
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
with an above ground tank because the
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
new company can come right out and set a
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
new tank and they can connect you but
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
with an underground tank the company is
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
not going to deliver into somebody
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
else's underground tank that's not legal
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
you can't deliver into somebody else's
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
container that's in the state law you
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
know not for propane but just for
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
General container law but that's in the
 
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.829 align:start position:0%
General container law but that's in the
state

00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
so that gets the Crux of what I was I
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
was going to ask uh later on that there
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
is a Prohibition of you just can't say
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
Company B would you please provide
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
propane gas into into this tank that I
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
just fired company A4 they just can't go
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
in there and just start adding gas is
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying not if the company
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
owns the tank so I have an underground
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
tank at my house not if the company owns
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
a tank I own the tank so I could change
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
tank companies tomorrow if I wanted was
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
there a is there a reason for that other
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
than it being a state like you said it
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
was a state law yes so it belongs having
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
some rsas available for from New
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be helpful uh that
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
describes that
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
so that container belongs to a specific
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
company so they own the gas in it until
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
the customer is paid for that gas that's
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
delivered into it and they've also done
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
a safety inspection on that tank they've
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
done a pressure test to make sure
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's not any leaks from the tank
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
itself all the way into the line into
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
the house they've checked all of it so
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
there's our safety rules too that have
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be done when a tank is changed out or
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
when ownership has changed out and and a
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
new company comes they'll come inspect
 
00:37:07.329 --> 00:37:07.339 align:start position:0%
the tank normally and do a pressure test
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
on the new system before they take them
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
without knowing that
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
the church and I apologize to
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative partial but he's been
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
waiting to ask a question so I'll defer
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for coming today
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um now time here earlier that you told
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
me that you informed us a number of
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
these underground tanks you've acquired
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
through acquisition
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
generally I would say generally speaking
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure the number of tanks that we
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire were AmeriGas put
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the ground and we have a contract to
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
show that but just generally our company
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
has been one that has grown through
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
acquisition and we did a big acquisition
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
for example in 2012 where it almost sort
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
of doubled the size of AmeriGas and so a
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
lot of that we didn't always get the
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
customer records that came with
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
everything so in my experience when
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
these issues have come across my desk
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's generally where the customer was an
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
acquisition customer and we don't have
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
any underlying documentation if there's
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
documentation we always look to that
 
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.250 align:start position:0%
documentation we always look to that
first

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
yes follow up please uh yes I'm looking
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
at your um Clause 14 here in terms of
 
00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.730 align:start position:0%
at your um Clause 14 here in terms of
agreement

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
and um it tells the customer that they
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
are responsible for all cause for the
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
excavation and removal of at least
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
equipment and companies not responsible
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
for Furnishing fill well it goes on but
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you've put a
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility of removal of an AmeriGas
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
tank entirely upon the customer am I
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
doing that correctly if there is no
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
underlying contract and we don't know
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
this was an attempt to try and get some
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
uniform policy together so there wasn't
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
this one-off every single time but
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
generally speaking this is what's here
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
so that customers could see it they
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
could say I don't want to accept your
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of Airgas come get
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
your tank and we and they can reject
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
what these terms and conditions are and
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
we will come pick up the tank what has
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
happened again we were trying to in
 
00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
light of not having underlying
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
documentation sort of putting it
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
together when we don't know what the
 
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
no more comment on that
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a scenario that is exactly
 
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.510 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a scenario that is exactly
my

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
house it's
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
subdivision by the owner that built the
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
subdivision he kind of deal with the gas
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
company so all the tanks that are set in
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
he built this multi-million dollar home
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
that's in my subdivision
 
00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:41.339 align:start position:0%
it's a nice subdivision but now that I'm
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the house 11 years old but we're
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
under that we're locked in there there's
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
no paperwork like you were saying
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
earlier so there's the only way out of
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
it is we would have to have the tank dug
 
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.790 align:start position:0%
it is we would have to have the tank dug
up

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
or you could buy like that's what I'm
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
saying you would transfer the tank
 
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
whether it was AmeriGas would sell the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
tank or the company that owned the tank
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
would sell the tank directly to you or
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
could sell it to it so they can you
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
still can do that there's no no
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
liability to whoever selling the tank
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it would come with a bill
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
of sale and the liability would transfer
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
with the sale of the taxes yeah because
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about that since uh
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
for a year now about this because in the
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
lousy contract I used to say I think
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's a conspiracy because he gets his
 
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
gas probably for free if it's putting
 
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:23.180 align:start position:0%
these 17 tanks and
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'll let you continue but uh I just make
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
a statement that it's uh absolutely we
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you know about 80
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
percent of our businesses in New
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are small family-owned
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and we certainly wouldn't
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
want to put any restrictions or
 
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
regulations in effect that would affect
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
particularly family-owned businesses I
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm not very sensitive to a
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
large corporation but we want to make
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't hurt our family-owned
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
businesses so
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
um uh it would be great if the
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
association perhaps to be a member of
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
the association they may want a few
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
things to be sterilized but I just want
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
to make that clear that that we're not
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
out to make any regulations here if we
 
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
don't have to because we know that will
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
probably affect the small family-owned
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
businesses the most and we don't want
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
at least I don't anyway
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
um so if you please continue and when
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
when you're done with your
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
other information we can open it up to
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
maybe more questions involving
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
specifics and everything so so again
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
what I'll do to to bring into a close is
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
is go through a couple things one again
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas puts all this information in
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
front of our customer at time of
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
contract so they can try and make an
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
um two we we
 
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
changed our business model to a more
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
centralized model and around on around
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
2019 and we had a little hiccups in the
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
road at that sort of
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the the transition particularly
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
during coved this particular year we
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
still have had some issues with driver
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
shortage and Tech shortage and then with
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
the change over and a number of our
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
customer experience agents answering the
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
phone we know we are we are working on
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
those things to address that so
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
specifically one we're continuing
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
training with the customer experience
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
agents we've taken all of the New
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire calls and put them into a
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
separate queue so they're going to more
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
experienced agents so that those
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
resolutions so the customer's not saying
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
I called America so they're not calling
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
me back we want that one call resolution
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
so they really only have to make one
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
call we are always looking at our terms
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
and conditions to say can we do
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
something better are we disclosing as
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
much information as we can so the
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
customer can make an informed decision
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then here specifically understanding
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
the issue of the tank we've looked at
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
where we are are with our tank picks up
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
pickups so we are going to try and sell
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
or transfer ownership to the to the 26
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
tanks that we see right now that are
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
underground tanks in New Hampshire and
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
we've contracted with a third-party
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
company to pick up any of the above
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
ground tanks and then what we will do is
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
on your fact sheet we have all of the
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
contact information and specifically for
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
for our colleagues and our competitors
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
that they have that number to call with
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
Victor sproza the director of territory
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
operations so if they get a customer you
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
know if Easter gets a customer and they
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
say we want to switch from AmeriGas Bob
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
Young knows who to call so that process
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
should be much more streamlined and
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you're here in our
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
commitment today this is what we're
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
going to do we don't want to be back in
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
front of this committee again saying hey
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas made a mistake or we didn't put
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
our customers where we know they should
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
be this is really what we want to do
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
again we have almost 30 000 customers we
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
made I think almost 40 000 delivery
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
since October 1st to now we do have a
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
lot of really happy customers we want to
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
continue to have happy customers
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and so but we do have a couple things
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh that we're going to work on and you
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
have our commitment today that we're
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to get those done
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.690 align:start position:0%
going to get those done
so

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.329 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
I guess the main question is
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
when how soon and are some things
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
already in effect so some things are
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
already in effect so right now the again
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
with the calls going through we are
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking I get a daily report from the
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
vice president who's in charge of our
 
00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:29.339 align:start position:0%
call centers to make sure I can see what
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
those New Hampshire numbers look like we
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
talk about it we have several meetings
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
internally to go through those numbers
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
and make sure we're we're hitting the
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
targets that we want to hit we have also
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
um one we've looked at our service order
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
and working with our service department
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
we've engaged at third party so I would
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
say for tank pickups probably 90 days I
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
just think with weather and with ground
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
and by contacting the customer we want
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
to make it so that it's convenient for
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
um who generally want to be there when
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
we go to pick up the tanks but from a
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
um any backlog of customer service
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
issues to me I think that's really 30
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
days if not sooner tank pickup I would
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
probably say probably 90 just given the
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
and representative from an operations
 
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.790 align:start position:0%
and representative from an operations
standpoint

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
um to add on to that we definitely
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
struggled with delivery Staffing for
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
much of the winter we are fully staffed
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh at this point in time from a delivery
 
00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.690 align:start position:0%
uh at this point in time from a delivery
standpoint

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
um essentially cleaned up on any
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
delivery backlogs uh across the entire
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
state in fact we were sitting uh better
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
than we happened several years in that
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
regard as well so
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of curious
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately representative rung has
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
left the room but I suspect that the
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the packet that she
 
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.370 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the packet that she
sent

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
sent
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
she won't return
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay the packet of complaints but
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
assuming that she came she she comes
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
from Merrimack I'm assuming she's
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
collecting a lot of information from her
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
constituents in Merrimack have you found
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
also the AG list I was just kind of
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
wondering how how many of them came from
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
Merrimack like to see if there's maybe a
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
a a geographic or or Regional issue as
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to the rest of the state
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen that we I can take a look
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
at that and we can see if it is sort of
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a geographic issue as opposed to
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
maybe just a
 
00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579 align:start position:0%
um some other issue but I haven't seen
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
her specific facts
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah they're they're just stats they're
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
not uh they're just complaints from
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
various companies
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah you're out there
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
tenfold at least but we do have a
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
specific tracking mechanism of every AG
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
complaint that we get by state so
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
certainly we have that detail
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
so but you haven't looked into it as far
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
as if you're coming so we have looked at
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
primary challenge I have looked at
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
specific complaints coming into
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
and then we also have again our it's
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
called a College ERM system
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
Mission management system so every time
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
a customer calls AmeriGas it's like a
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
note goes into the system that says
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
Michelle called in because she had a
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
question about tank rent or Michelle
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
wants to know what the price per gallon
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be for her delivery all of
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
those interactions get tracked in our
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
system so we can see so that's where any
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
agent if I were to call into America
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
they could see all the times that I've
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
called in or what my previous questions
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
were so I'm I'm pretty positive if those
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
complaints are there we would have a
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a quick question
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
on the especially when you brought up
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
rental fees and now I know that was
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
based on a lot of the complaints there
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
as well is um
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
what what is written or decides when a
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
person when the company owns a tank when
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
the people own the tank or especially
 
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
when they own it they're not when the
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
company owns it they're not paying
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
anything and then all of a sudden they
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
start getting charged rental fees what
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
changes from an ownership to uh uh well
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
they don't pay rental fees to what point
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
where they do
 
00:48:16.329 --> 00:48:16.339 align:start position:0%
so generally speaking if it is a if if
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
the customer owns the tank they're not
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
paying any rental fees because they own
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
the tank they've either bought it from
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
another reseller or they bought it from
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
a propane company but if they own the
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
tank the car or at least I'll say
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas doesn't charge customers for
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
tank rent on tanks that they don't own
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
um if AmeriGas owns a tank it is uh it's
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
an asset of the company it's steel so we
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
charge a tank rent and at time of
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
contract you will you will be told so
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
again going to the various size whether
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
it's 100 pound cylinder or a 500 gallon
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
tank you will be told what your tank
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
rent charge is and that there may be a
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
CPI or other increase that is at time of
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
contract and so the customer will know
 
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is and the tank rent can
 
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
vary basically for Geographic reasons
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
maybe some competitive reasons or again
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
the size of the tank
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
where it gets where it can also be
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
different is through historic industry
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
practice I will say and Leslie spoke a
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
little bit there may be something called
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
a minimum use whereas if you're a high
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
volume customer the company May waive
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
tank rent because you're purchasing so
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
many gallons but if you're a low volume
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
usage um they may say okay if you only
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
are gonna buy 50 gallons you're going to
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
have a tank rent charge so different
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
companies will disclose if they disclose
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
it when tank right may be applicable to
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
you outside maybe that additional
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
contract so on here I think we have in
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
our terms and conditions I think it is
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
two times the volume of the tank so the
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
customer will know when they're if
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
they've triggered that where they've
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
used two times the volume of that tank
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
and a trail in 12 months so now they
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
know whether they're going to pay tank
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
rent or not based on the original
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
contract so again where it can get
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
confusing is if it's an acquisition
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
customer no one had a contract they
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
don't understand maybe the company has
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
waived tank rent if you call in and say
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know what you I had a late delivery
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
this year I don't think I should pay
 
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
tank right our agents are told you can
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
freely negotiate with a customer and you
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
can waive the tank rent for that year if
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
you want to waiver for the customer
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
particularly the customer says I may
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
leave so they're allowed to make
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:36.020 align:start position:0%
maybe missed it so
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh but I thought we'll talk about when
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
you have underground tanks you have to
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
you only fill tanks that are owned by
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas correct so in that case you
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
charge rent to every one of your
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
customers yeah
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
so and there could be a number of
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why we may not one is maybe at
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
the time of negotiation
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
they said we don't we don't want to pay
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
tank rent and America said okay we'll
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
still do business with you you're not
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
going to pay take rent or it is a
 
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
situation where we may not have that
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
background we may not know what was
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated at the time so we may say
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
because we don't know we're not going to
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
charge tank rent on that particular
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
customer or we do have a contract and it
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
says if you have the minimum use and you
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
meet those Minimus we won't charge you
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
tank rent so there could be a number of
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why on a AmeriGas owned tank you
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
may or may not have tank rent
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
I hate this first another follow-up I
 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
got one quick I can
 
00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:35.089 align:start position:0%
got one quick I can
quick

00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:35.710 align:start position:0%
quick
um

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I apologize chair last
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
question is are the customers aware that
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
they of these different options they
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
have when they begin business with
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
marigas are they aware of their
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
different options and willing and
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
when we come in we have this sort of
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
scripts that go through sometimes maybe
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
it could be a a new customer package
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
where we'll wave tank rent for the first
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
year because you're a new customer those
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
sort of things we lay that out at the
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
time of contract of when you will get
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
tank rent and then that's what we also
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
put in the terms and conditions what
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
that tank run is attempting to cover
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you but I I will also say
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
because of history and acquisitions
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
it may not be 100 completely consistent
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
but that is the goal of what AmeriGas is
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
trying to do at time of contract you're
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
told what take credit's going to be
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman so my
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
question might best be answered by Ms
 
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.290 align:start position:0%
question might best be answered by Ms
Anderson

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
Anderson
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
do propane companies typically
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
require customers to sign a new contract
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
I belong to a propane Co-op
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
that aggregates
 
00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:51.619 align:start position:0%
a bunch of
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
gallonage and then goes out and talks to
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
a company about getting giving them a
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
special price for that gallonage
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
and those of us who are part of the
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
co-op have to sign a contract once we're
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
once we're offered that price
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
I've never noticed that that contract
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
says anything about the tank
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
it seems to be just about the propane
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
itself but my question for you is is
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
that fairly standard practice among
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
propane companies to require people to
 
00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:26.660 align:start position:0%
sign a contract every year or is that
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
unique to my situation
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
so you normally will be signing a
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
contract if you are pre-buying your bet
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
your gallons a lot of people decide in
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
the summer to lock in their gallons and
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
pre-buy them uh because they're going to
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
cost less when they buy the Futures
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
historically not always but nine times
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
out of ten it's going to be more
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
advantageous of you to buy your gallons
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the summertime when gas is
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and lock it in for the year
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and in that case you will have a written
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
contract the dealer is actually required
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
to put a bond of a certain amount down
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if they went out of
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
business you would still get your
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
gallons you know that's in so they're
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
going to have a written contract on that
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
and many of the companies included in
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
that contract will include the tank
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
terms that they have that are in there
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
previous to taking this position I was
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
in Michelle's position at Dead River
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
Company and wrote the contracts and we
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
had in there for underground tanks and
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the contracts that I wrote and we
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
would put it in the pre-buy contracts
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
we'd also put it in a fixed price
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
contract so we offer are fixed prices
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
where you pay a little fee to lock in
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
the Futures price on it your price won't
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
go up and if it goes down you get the
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
lower price so there's like four
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
different pricing options we had for
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
customers depending on how they wanted
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
to to buy their propane and when
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and in each of those we had
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
information in there about minimum use
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
fees and we also had information and
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
when they kicked in in that kind of case
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
they would kick in at a certain gallage
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
amount and we also had um underground
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
tanks in there and that if you decided
 
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
to change you would either have to help
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
pay to remove the tank from the ground
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
or you could buy the tank from us
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
that was in our contract
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question would be can you
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
explain to me what a safety fee is and
 
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.950 align:start position:0%
explain to me what a safety fee is and
why

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
it has gone up fairly steadily over the
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure specifically what that
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
company is putting into their safety fee
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
I could find out for you if you can let
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
me know who the company is that's there
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
I would imagine if it's a safety fee it
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
might have to do with cathodic
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
protection on the tank when you have an
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
underground tank in specifically every
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
after 10 years you need to go out and
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
check it every year and make sure that
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's not rusting or having any any
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
problems it has adequate cathodic
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
protection in the ground for it it could
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
be related to DOT requirements that they
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
have an additional
 
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.170 align:start position:0%
have an additional
um

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:11.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for delivering of Hazmat
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so I'm not specifically sure
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
what what they're lumping into that fee
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
I've also seen meter fees on some of the
 
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
I've also seen meter fees on some of the
bills

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
um that that people will have and have
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
come out and I think one of the things
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
that causes confusion is when there's
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
acquisition there's a lot of
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions in our industry and it
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
makes it confusing when you have a
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
company acquire another and that other
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
company might have been for sale because
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
they weren't doing so well maybe they
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
weren't doing so well because they
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
weren't charging minimum use fees on
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
some of their assets that were out there
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
you know and then they get bought and
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
the new company comes in and looks at
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
the book of business and says well these
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
accounts over here don't make any sense
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to have to change
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
how we handle those and then when
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
there's suddenly a new fee
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
um depending on how well that's
 
00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
communicated it can cause some problems
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
for the for the consumer
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
so we do try to work with the AGS and
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection if people call
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
in and have a complaint they direct them
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
to our office we reach out to upper
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
management at our members have them
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
resolve it if they can and then if if
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's not successfully resolved it can go
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
back to the AG's office we also handle a
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
lot of calls in the winter time from the
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
governor's office where people will call
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times it's someone that's a
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
single mother they've got a kid they
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
can't afford to get heating you know
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
bills paid and how can somebody in your
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
Association help out you know and I'll
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
reach out to a member and they'll get
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
them signed up with LIHEAP or work with
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
them to get a delivery made and then put
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
them on a payment plan to work it back
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
so we handle a lot of calls and we try
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
to make ourselves available to the
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
places where people would go to complain
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
like the consumer protection and refer
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
them to us because we do want to make
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
sure as an industry that we have good
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
customer service
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
and making sure that it's easy for
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
people that with underground tanks to
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
transfer those tanks if they do have a
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
bad experience and want to change
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
companies is something that we will be
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking with our members about to make
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a best practices in
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
place and the industry members are all
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would also encourage you
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
to if you do develop these best
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
practices to share those with all
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
customers too so that those of us who
 
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.089 align:start position:0%
customers too so that those of us who
are

00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
are buying the propane and maybe wanting
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
to change vendors will know what to
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
following up after what what a chairman
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
spoke about is a
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
I see a uh a big opening here for the
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
association to put together a template
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
of these are all the kinds of fees you
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
can expect in dealing with your gas
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
company whether it be tank fees safety
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
fees switch switching fees from one
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
company to another uh minimum use fees
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
what all all the whole bucket of the
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
universe it fees and and costs might be
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
in dealing with having gas as something
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
that you want to buy
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
then every company can
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
come in and fill in all right on this
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
master laundry list here's how we deal
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
but that puts customers in the position
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
to be be able to say oh well if I go
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
this route
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
you know I I see all these things that I
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
have to pay or not pay as the case may
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
be and not be confused what we saw as
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
committee members was just this
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
unbelievable display of I don't get why
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
I'm getting all these fees and what's
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
happening to me and why I can't move
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
simply from point A to point B when I
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
used to be able to do it before
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
and it's because everybody's got a
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
different way of doing business and no
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
one knows what all these ways are
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
think if you
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
create such a a common template and you
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
can't put the fees on it because that'd
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
be antitrust issues but at least but at
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
least here are these the uh the terms
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
that may be relevant for the gas service
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
that you want to buy so that just any
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
customer wanting to make a change or
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
initiate a service would say okay it's
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
not as simple as going to the gas pump
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the gas station and putting the gas
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
in it's it's way more complicated than
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
that and including that that you know
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
there may be differences if you own a
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
tank or not own a tank or don't know if
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
you own the tank you know this is all
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh well it's exactly in
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
many ways it's exactly what I was going
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
to say but I was going to add that and
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
just thank you mayor gas for giving us
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
this information but I count 17 fees
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
right here in in their list of of
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
potential fees
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
um they they kind of explain what they
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
are and they give you the price that
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
that that you'll pay
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
um including if you want a paper copy
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to charge you almost three
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
bucks per invoice
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
um now I understand some companies may
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
not list as many fees like that but they
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
may have a higher price per gallon to
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
cover certain fees you may not even wait
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
you may not even be aware you're paying
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
for them but
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.770 align:start position:0%
for them but
um

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
getting back into what I think is time
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
we can start asking a few questions
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
are these fees
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
mandated or business driven or a
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
combination of both uh and is there any
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
way that we can
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
talk about those fees and why we have
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
them I guess you could say everything
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
costs money and rather than charge it
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
into a price per gallon we're just gonna
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
get them out or maybe these fees maybe
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
they may maybe most of them don't even
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
apply to people they're just there in
 
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.329 align:start position:0%
apply to people they're just there in
case

01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
so can we have a little discussion on
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
that and also I I I I I know you're
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
giving us a presentation but we have
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
other Industries other companies here as
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
well maybe they might like to speak up
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
on on perhaps how they do business I
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
recognize AmeriGas you're quite large in
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
this state and you have certain
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
capabilities that you're talking about
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be doing this and
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
that and hiring people for that
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
our other family-owned business
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
businesses may not be able or may not be
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
doing that because you're much much
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
smaller so perhaps what are they going
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
to do or is there a industry standard at
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
least to be a member of your Association
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have any any industry standards
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
set for fees themselves
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that there's people here I think it
 
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
would make sense for the other three
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
companies that have come today to talk
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
about the fees that they have so you can
 
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
have an overview of what it is I think
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
most companies try to address it in the
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
price per gallon put all their costs
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
into that for delivery and then some
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
companies I think add additional fees
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
because they don't apply to everyone so
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
it may be more beneficial overall for
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
their consumers to only be charged if it
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
applies to them uh so it's it you know
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's all competitive and driven by the
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
marketplace so we're not regulated at
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
all in terms of fees
 
01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.549 align:start position:0%
all in terms of fees
um

01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
is there would
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind would some other
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
company like to come up and say a few
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
words where you don't have to if you
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
don't want to we're just extending the
 
01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:13.549 align:start position:0%
don't want to we're just extending the
invitation

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
I'm Debra show with do you appreciate
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
Angie and Dover
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:04:25.089 --> 01:04:25.099 align:start position:0%
um well I I guess I'll start with uh
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
like I said AmeriGas offered like 17
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
fees I won't go over each one of them
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
but uh what what drives some of your
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
fees and uh are there are there some
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
federal mandates are there some State
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
mandates are there some business
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh needs I mean can you describe a
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
little bit about how your company does
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
it mostly it's uh based on the cost of
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
doing business but primarily our our
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
company in Dover we only have one fee
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any other delivery
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
fees Hazmat fees it's just if we have a
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
generator account it's a usage fee and
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
those tend to be very sporadic sometimes
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
you can have power outage and you go
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
through propane in a day or two
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't have any power
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
outages and you don't have a delivery
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
for three years so that's what we have
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
to accommodate for the cost of Steel it
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
is skyrocketed over the last two or
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
three years it's gone up triple so
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
typically we just started doing uses
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
fees but we have to accommodate for that
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
increased cost to be able to give that
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
tank out as a loaner suit to get some
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
recoup on that on that asset
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that it's if someone
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh is transferring over to your company
 
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.970 align:start position:0%
uh is transferring over to your company
uh

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:36.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
you would have to remove the other
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
company's tank
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
um primarily no most of the time we have
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
an agreement so say
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
um customer will call into our company
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
they are just expressing a desire to
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
change companies because of some unknown
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
reasons and whatnot so they call in we
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
send out a sales rep to go out and take
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
a look at the tank over the in and the
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the house to make sure there is no
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
glaring issues as far as liabilities and
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
whatnot so if that checks out
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
um we'll move forward in taking down the
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
serial number and whatnot of the tank
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
itself and we will have the customer
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
call and express a uh that they have to
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
verbalize that they want to change and
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
then at that point we will contact that
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
company with the serial number and it's
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
as simple as that they will produce a
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
invoice and charges for that company
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:35.089 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
off the topic anyway yeah so thanks very
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
much my question
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
um and first congratulations I see
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
you're very highly rated with the state
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire oh thank you 91 years
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
in business uh since 1932. so that's a
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
good one
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
um tell me um
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
do you have problems with fulfillment
 
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
due to labor shortages drivers well ex
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're all experiencing some type of
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
challenges right now with the labor
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
market and um
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
it is a known fact and we're trying to
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
work with a lot of votechs right now and
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
trying to entice young people to come on
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
board within the trades instead of going
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
to a four-year color so we're trying to
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
be a little creative with that right now
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
do you well
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
one one the obvious question then would
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
do you find that because of this labor
 
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
shortage are you uh are your customers
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing prolonged delays and
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
deliveries or anything like that no
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
we've we've got a great Labor Force
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of gentlemen at work a
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
lot of hours and they're very dedicated
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have been been with us 20
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
30 years and we don't want them to age
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
out we're really stressed out about that
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
right now so we're trying to get the
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
younger generation to come up through
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's too much
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is just a quick mathematical
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
question and this is ties to the all the
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
fees so just looking at the Hazmat fee
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
which is just be on the safety and
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
safety compliance and thank you AmeriGas
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
for providing the number of customers
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
you have because that helped out the
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
math 29 632 customers at this fee which
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
is each each fill up and I know
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
everybody's not going to filter tank
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
twice but I'd say it's probably about
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
the average per year
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
um seven million dollars for the
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire per year to
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
just for safety fee so um
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
oh I guess my question is is
 
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.269 align:start position:0%
oh I guess my question is is
um

01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
is this where the profit is made is off
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
there may be reasons why you know
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
depending on it is generally charged for
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
delivery but sort of like tank thread
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes these fees get waived
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
customers customers to call in so I
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what the exact daughter or
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the number of New Hampshire customers
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
that can't
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
follow up real quick
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
can that so the Hazmat fee is that can
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
that be negotiated to be excluded as
 
01:09:00.299 --> 01:09:07.130 align:start position:0%
that be negotiated to be excluded as
well

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:21.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:21.849 --> 01:09:21.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
after that so uh sounds obvious but I'll
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
ask anyway so in my case I get anywhere
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
from four to five Phillips a year one of
 
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
the start of the season and one of the
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
end of April and I'm on my own after
 
01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.269 align:start position:0%
end of April and I'm on my own after
that

01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so would that be would that Hazmat
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
charge be charged for each one of those
 
01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:43.669 align:start position:0%
charge be charged for each one of those
Phillips

01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
01:09:43.679 --> 01:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
Phillips
foreign

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
have customer changeovers uh are any
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
kind of difficulties in the tank
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
changeouts what not how do you deal with
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
anymore

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
and if they can't produce that
 
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
and if they can't produce that
information

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:57.169 align:start position:0%
thank you
is

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
we can't fight
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
so we've spoken to marigas already and
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
now we're speaking uh
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
um to someone different are you an
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas dealer
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
no Okay so
 
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
if there was some kind of a standard in
 
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.070 align:start position:0%
if there was some kind of a standard in
place

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
maybe not a legal standard but a a best
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
practices standard developed by the
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
propane Association would you find that
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
something that you would
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
find advantageous to follow or do you
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
think you need
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
because of your own unique customer
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances you need to develop your
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
own process for doing things like
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
so this question is a general question
 
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.330 align:start position:0%
so this question is a general question
uh

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
primarily to the association but maybe
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else so as I look at these fees
 
01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:24.350 align:start position:0%
anyone else so as I look at these fees
here

01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that from what we heard in testimony
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
was going to be if we needed a study
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
committee to discuss
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
fees what they are why they're needed
 
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:44.780 align:start position:0%
and why they vary in costs so much
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
so this is an opportunity to perhaps
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
discuss that issue
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
one company says they don't charge those
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
fees the other company says they they
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
charge them it's like a you know LMO
 
01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but I also hear that whether you
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
charge them
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
outwardly or not
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
they all get rolled up into the price
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
that you're charging for your price per
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
gallon or are there fees that companies
 
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
gallon or are there fees that companies
honestly

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
do not charge because they do not incur
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't incur them would they
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
charge them I mean uh I'm just trying to
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
figure out if if
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
we can ask the question are these fees
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
Justified and you could read right here
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
and say Well they're Justified because
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
you say they are
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
um but do other companies
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
would they also charge these fees if
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
they had to do the same thing that's was
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
listed here I guess that's what I'm
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
trying to say now more a question for
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
the probing Association I think
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
I think those these are
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
probably the majority of companies roll
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
the fees all into their price per gallon
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and then we have Eastern Propane here
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I've talked with them about fees
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
before I don't know if you guys want to
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about how you how you
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
um but it's just a different business
 
01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.669 align:start position:0%
um but it's just a different business
model

01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know some companies lay it all out
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
and but the majority of them put it all
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
I think into their their gallon fee and
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
then they might have a few fees for
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
exception you know like generators
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
accounts things that are unusual
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and would would not fit the normal
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
at the risk of not trying to sound trite
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
um does that mean that if they roll
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
their fees into the price of their price
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
per gallon does that mean customers are
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand the question
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
because I think some companies are just
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
breaking out their business models so
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
there are costs associated with Hazmat
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
licensing and DOT requirements there's
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
tests that have to be done and and for
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
safety reasons and different things so I
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
think some people are just breaking it
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
down in their
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
bill you know and others are just
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
putting it all into one fee or one cost
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
in the price per gallon so it's I think
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like getting an itemized
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
Bill versus getting just a grand total
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
well okay I understand that but um
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh certain things like a reconnect
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
charge wouldn't apply if you didn't get
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
reconnected uh but I wouldn't think that
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
a company would I hope companies not
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
charging that fee as part of their price
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
per gallon even though they're not
 
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.050 align:start position:0%
per gallon even though they're not
reconnecting

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
reconnecting
 
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
I guess we're just trying to determine
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
if we need to study these fees uh
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
further I'm I'm hoping we don't but
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get answers
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
here but I'll leave that question like
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
for the time being and defer to our next
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
can you shed some light on uh how you
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
um yes as I kind of suspected something
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
like that I just wanted to hear what
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
people had to say What's a what's a
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
anything

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm still a little
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
bit confused about this question of
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
rolling up fees into your price per
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
gallon wouldn't that put you in a
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage to people who
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
shop based on the price per gallon
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate on how that would
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
Ms Anderson could you explain a little
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
bit more about what rolling fees and to
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
the price per gallon is all about I'm
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
still confused about that
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
well I think I was just trying to
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
explain what some of the companies are
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
calling different fees so you heard the
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
meter reading fee and that is the extra
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
cost for going out and checking the
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
meter at a location
 
01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:23.330 align:start position:0%
meter at a location
um

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's also I've seen some you
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned a safety fee that might be
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
also a Hazmat fee that I've seen which
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
covers additional expenses for training
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
drivers and DOT requirements that have
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
come in you know it's a lot harder today
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
to get a driver on the road than it was
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
even a year ago and
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
some companies I think are addressing
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
these by individualizing those line
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
items so they may have had a price per
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
gallon and then the cost of business
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
keeps going up you know um I've seen on
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
my own bills not from propane companies
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I get a delivery fee when
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
the price of gasoline or diesel gets
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
high you know so I think it's along the
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
lines of that when there's a new
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
surcharge or something that comes in
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
that the company is is trying to make up
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
the expense of that program through the
 
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
use of a fee
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then other companies like like
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
Eastern have decided that they're going
 
01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
to have one price and they're not going
 
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
and this isn't this is added onto fees
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
it was one of the complaints in the bill
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
and but it's not mentioned on here is
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
the minimum fill fees so I'm speaking
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
from personal experience if you have a
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
500 gallon tank
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
the minimum required for the company I
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
have is 250 gallons to fill it but if
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to tell because you have a
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
percentage meter on your tank so you
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
don't really know what's exactly in
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
there so I only need 220
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
I still get charged for 250. so an extra
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
30 gallons I'm getting charged I'm not
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
actually using do you do practices like
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that normal for you to do that as
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this complaint sheet here
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
that the you know stature uh you uh you
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
didn't get the trophy but you're in
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
second place uh can you make uh are you
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
aware of of them and and and know what
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
actions you might want to be taking if
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
if any or we have no idea we have no
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
idea of knowing how old these complaints
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
are that's unfortunately we don't know
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
but uh but are you aware of of of of
 
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:33.260 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so I have a general question uh
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
the way the industry is run here even
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide I'm assuming and we're
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking we're talking only propane here
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
right now anyway right so uh
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's like a commodity so
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
it is volatile the the price is volatile
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
but not every so um
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
is that why we have a lot of um
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
number one a lot of different
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
ways companies handle their business
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
um uh one standard way may not fit a
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
model because of the volatility of of
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
say propane gas up or down or does that
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
play into why our propane industry
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
business model is kind of like the way
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
it is right now as opposed to
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
some other you know firm of say let's
 
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
some other you know firm of say let's
say

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know much of oil oils the same
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
ways oils volatile as well but but just
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
the the market itself because of the
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel type of upsells everything
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
is that why we have all these different
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
probably more to do with companies that
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
operate in multiple States I think you
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
you pointed out that there's a lot of
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
fees on amerigasa's terms but they
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
operate in 50 states so they're trying I
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
think to have a contract that covers all
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
of those 50 states as well where it
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
probably a smaller company wouldn't have
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
those and propane is the least volatile
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
of all of the the delivered fuels it's
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
stayed the most the steady you know and
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
prices are down from last year there's
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
an excess of propane there's more
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
protein produced every year than is ever
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
used globally around the world you know
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is just flared off and
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
wasted so the use of it is really a
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
great way to reduce greenhouse gas
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
emissions because you're either using it
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
or you're you're flaring it off anyway
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um it's I think it's just about the way
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
companies do business and the difference
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that exists between a small company
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
and a larger company
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that oil is necessarily
 
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:49.460 align:start position:0%
standardized in oil
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
delivery the customers own their own
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
tanks so a customer can call one company
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
one day in another company the other day
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and as long as the company can get
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
out and probably do an inspection most
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
of them require that to make sure that
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
everything's hooked up right they're not
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
going to just pump it into somebody's
 
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
basement then
 
01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.070 align:start position:0%
basement then
um

01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more freedom and there's
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
more competition also there's more
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
heating oil companies out there than
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
there are propane companies because the
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
propane requires a much larger
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
investment you have to invest 150 000 in
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
your first truck and you have to invest
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
in tanks to to put out to supply because
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
to get customers the dealers frequently
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
Supply the tanks um and that keeps the
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
customer from having to have that big
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
investment you know to to buy a tank on
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
it does make the changing a little
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
harder because the companies have to
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
coordinate and and transfer the assets
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
of those tanks uh when that happens but
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
I think that's the main the main
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
difference that there is between propane
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
and and heat oil
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
you have feet there are a lot of Feeds
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
out there for heating oil also for
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
it just depends on the company it's the
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
same thing but there's there's companies
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
that have delivery charges and Hazmat
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
fees and safety fees for oil deliveries
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's curious what's the lifespan of a
 
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.669 align:start position:0%
that's curious what's the lifespan of a
tank

01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
the lifespan of an in-ground tank it
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of soil that you
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
have and everything but there's tanks
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
that are out there 50 60 70 years
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
um I think we have granite in the state
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that you'd want to be
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
checking it every year if your tank is
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
over 20 years old for sure the
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to go to cathodic
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
protection at 10 10 years to get it
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
cathodically protection tested uh and
 
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then they can add anoids to it if
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um is that something that the company
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
would do on their own without even you
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
even knowing about it
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh they they might call to coordinate to
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
let you know they're going to be out you
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
know in your backyard with wires and
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
checking to make sure your tank is okay
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
so they probably would coordinate to let
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know that they're coming to do that
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
but yes companies they have an asset in
 
01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
the ground that they want to maintain so
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to be out there doing that
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh that being said uh above ground tank
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
on the coast in salt conditions is going
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
to be changed out a lot free more
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
frequently than it's it's lifespan a lot
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of the companies change those out
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
every five years just because they start
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
to rust and they take them back and they
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
refurbish them and and get them cleaned
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
up and ready for reuse and against it
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
since if the company owns tank they
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
they're responsible to replace it on
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
their own and everything if if need be
 
01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's a technique used to control the
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
corrosion of a metal surface by making
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
it the cathode of an extra
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
electrochemical cell
 
01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:13.940 align:start position:0%
so it's a test that you do to
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
intact that that it's still structurally
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes you're testing to make sure the
 
01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
cathodic protection system is in place
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
and operating correctly because if you
 
01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't have cathodic protection in place
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have degradation of
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the steel in the ground because it's in
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
contact with the soil and with a you
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
know groundwater potentially with
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
different minerals so when you install a
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
tank you put in a cathodic protection
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
and it's if you fish and you have anodes
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
on your boat that you throw over in the
 
01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
salt water it's the same same idea as
 
01:29:54.659 --> 01:29:55.610 align:start position:0%
salt water it's the same same idea as
that

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
um do you want to explain it better you
 
01:29:58.729 --> 01:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
probably have more serious experience
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
over typical 500 gallon tank in New
 
01:30:23.159 --> 01:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
over typical 500 gallon tank in New
England

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
a cloth bag or a
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
metallic bag what
 
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:34.430 align:start position:0%
metallic bag what
yeah

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a test it's an actual
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
system that's been installed installed
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
and you check the system and if it's
 
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
today

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:08.810 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
new installation to start right from
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
that get all the older ones so if your
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
tank was installed before 2014 it
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you oh
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
is a homeowner
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to ask the propane company to
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
look at all of the tests and times if
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.159 --> 01:31:48.530 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
would any other industry experts like to
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
come up and speak at all you you have
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm Daniel with white Mountain Oil in
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
North Conway and um I just want to I
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want to talk about Hazmat
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
fees and all the other fees because we
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't really we have a meter read fee
 
01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:16.729 align:start position:0%
don't really we have a meter read fee
um

01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to reassure everyone
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
that there really is an industry
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
standard with trading tanks that's
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
something I've been doing for more than
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
40 years and uh and it's worked
 
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.910 align:start position:0%
40 years and uh and it's worked
seamlessly

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
seamlessly
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh AmeriGas had some communication
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
issues which they have talked about and
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to address but other than
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
that with the guys that are in this room
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
and the 17 other companies that I deal
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
with trading an underground tank is
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
it's very is simple and there are serial
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
numbers on the tank and sometimes with a
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
customer who says they own their own
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
tank I relate it to like a vin number on
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
a car if you can show me the VIN number
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
if you can show me the purchase we're
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
fine but
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
if not the propane companies keep track
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.139 --> 01:33:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
very rarely I I can't even think of an
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
instance where we've put up both those
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
are in somebody's yard and dug up attack
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's always done on paper it's usually
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
an invoice or the other procedure is um
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
I mind oh Eastern a tank
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
so instead of they instead of selling it
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
we'll drop a new tank off in their yard
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
or we'll give them a permission to pick
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
up a tank
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
from FW Webb and Bill us so that's how
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's done it's done on paper and we all
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
get along fine
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I love about this
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
business is we I say we fight on the
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
streets but we all meet at the bar at
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and tell War Stories
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
so there hasn't been a problem trading
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
tanks and a customer should I used to be
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
here for us not anymore I just I just
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
want to reassure you that the consumer
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't feel that they're trapped with
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
these Underground
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
not in my experience and I'll answer
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%

anybody else would like to say a few
 
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to say a few
words

01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry I thought I saw some getting
up

01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%

01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay well uh with that being said uh
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
let's review what AmeriGas has said
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
would you summarize in a commitment to
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire what you
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
are currently doing and what you plan to
 
01:34:57.169 --> 01:34:57.179 align:start position:0%
do and when you plan to get there
 
01:34:57.179 --> 01:34:59.149 align:start position:0%
do and when you plan to get there
activities

01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
question could you uh give us a supply
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
of business cards so that we can contact
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
you if we have any issues we can't
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
resolve for constituents
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
so uh now this might be highly unusual I
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I I haven't been in this position for
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
you know 30 years but uh may I ask uh Mr
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
Skelly uh there is going to be a point
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
in time uh this spring I'm sure our
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be handling some
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
Senate bills and we'll be meeting at
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
some time man can I ask you to come back
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
at some time probably in the May time
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
frame and uh perhaps you can give us an
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
update on what's what has happened I'm
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
not going to ask anyone else to come
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
back here but perhaps if they can go
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
through you and you can just come back
 
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.270 align:start position:0%
through you and you can just come back
and

01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
even offline or or we'll we'll reserve
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
some time maybe five minutes and you can
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
just let us know
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
um what the you know how far they've
 
01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.970 align:start position:0%
um what the you know how far they've
gone

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.739 --> 01:38:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
what's this
 
01:38:56.209 --> 01:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
that's that's entirely up to you but
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yes and I just might
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
state that um I I
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
I know the representative from Merrimack
 
01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:06.179 align:start position:0%
I would I would look into the Merrimack
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
issues first if you would because I have
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
a feeling that if nothing changes we
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
might be looking at an a a different but
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
similar Bill next year so
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that's my you know I think
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
obviously Merrimack has some is a center
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
of some of these complaints it would
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
seem because it comes from one person
 
01:39:32.050 --> 01:39:32.060 align:start position:0%
but um you know that's just
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
that some people won't let this go away
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
if it's not corrected that's all I'm
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
saying yes
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
the record I live in Merrimack that's
 
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
the record I live in Merrimack that's
right

01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
blew up here from Florida and
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and he's members of the
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
geographic we're out in the state of the
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
camp here and the other
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
200 plus you know fuel deals 30 propane
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
folks just like these people in the room
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
stayed in the campus way thank you for
 
01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll give the association a
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
chance to speak and see if if you're
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I I think that you had some excellent
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I'm going to take
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
those back to my members to talk about
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
how we can make these fees more
 
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.370 align:start position:0%
how we can make these fees more
understandable

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:42.380 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
and explain what they are more
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
transparent to the customers so I will
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
bring that back to my members in New
 
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we will definitely discuss
 
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.129 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we will definitely discuss
it

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
I think yeah
 
01:40:56.410 --> 01:40:56.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll hear that in may as well
 
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:16.940 align:start position:0%
