1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
when.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.500
We will begin the public hearing in just a couple minutes.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:24.500
If you are not speaking but wish to indicate how you feel about the bill, either pro or con, please sign the blue sheet over on the table on the side wall over there.

4
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
It would be appreciated.

5
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
We'll begin the public hearing in just a couple minutes.

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Thank you.

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm about to open the public hearing on House Bill 2022, an act relative to the 10-year transportation plan, and I would call on Representative Pat Abramny.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Thank you, Mr.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Chair.

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
For the record, State Rep.

11
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Pat Abramny, Rocky M19 Stratum.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm here to request, at the request of the Stratum Select Board, to discuss the NH 108 Bunker Hill Avenue traffic light request, which is in the plan.

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it's been in the plan.

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It was a Rockingham Planning Commission priority project for 2019 to 2028.

15
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If we could turn to page 170 of the proposed plan, you'll see that listed there.

16
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Thank you.

17
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
On page 170 of the proposed plan, you'll see that listed there.

18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.500
But this has been a priority for stratum for at least 15 years before it made it to the 10-year plan in 2019.

19
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Just in the past 10 years, there have been 35 collisions at that intersection.

20
00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.000
On page 171, right across from this, you'll see the Stratum Greenland project implement safety improvements along New Hampshire 33 corridor.

21
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Our select board is happy to see this project added and given immediate status.

22
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.500
However, they feel that the traffic light project is of higher priority for the town of Stratum.

23
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:34.500
My counsel to the select board was asking for more money in the plan to move the traffic light project forward more quickly would be a non-starter in this committee.

24
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:50.500
However, getting an agreement with Greenland to slow the Route 33 project to be able to move the traffic light project forward would be the only way to amend the 10-year plan.

25
00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:08.500
If executing this plan next week instead of today, if that happens, or if there is a negotiation between Stratum and Greenland that concludes with an agreement, there is a chance an amendment would come forward.

26
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Given the calendar, an amendment more likely would be done in the Senate, although this committee would have to concur with any change that's done in the Senate.

27
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.000
Our Stratum Town planner, Mark Connors, will be testifying in a bit to add some additional context to this.

28
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.500
So those are my only comments, Mr.

29
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500
Chair.

30
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
Thank you.

31
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
Thank you.

32
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.000
Questions to Representative Romney from members of the committee?

33
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Seeing none, thank you.

34
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:14.500
For the members of the public who are waiting here to testify, the tradition of the House and Senate both is to take the representatives who have to go off to other committees and do their work first, and then hear from members of the general public or those representing towns or counties.

35
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
Moving on, Representative Ulery.

36
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Thank you, Mr.

37
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Chair.

38
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.500
For the record, my name is Jordan Ollery, representing Hillsboro 37, Hudson, and Pelham.

39
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:44.000
Somehow or another, the Hudson Circumferential Highway, which has always been part of the plan for decades and has partially been built with the Sagamore Bridge, was not on the plan this year.

40
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.500
I don't know how that happened, particularly since the governor said that he wanted it in there.

41
00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.500
However, before you've got several packages of support from a variety of people, state senators, our two U.S.

42
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.000
senators, and the National Regional Planning Commission.

43
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Lowell Road in Hudson is a failed road.

44
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's a state road.

45
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's failed.

46
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Right now, to get from the Sagamore Bridge to Presentation in Mary, where the road goes from four to two lanes either direction takes during the rush hour 30 to 45 minutes.

47
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.500
The distance is less than a mile.

48
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.500
Traffic is heavy.

49
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.000
The majority of the traffic is not Hudson residents.

50
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.500
The majority of the traffic are Litchfield, Wyndham, Salem, and Londonderry.

51
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.000
This is not a Hudson town situation as far as service.

52
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.500
This is a regional problem.

53
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:31.500
because people take Wall Road to get to the Sagamore Bridge to get to Route 3 to get to the I suppose the Western take Wall Road to get to the Sagamore Bridge to get to Route 3, to get to the, I suppose, the western or southern side of 128 to Waltham to the high-tech businesses down there to avoid traveling 128 from 93 up, which is also a failed road, but that's Massachusetts' problem, not ours.

54
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:44.500
In order to make Hudson a safer road, to make the travel for all who use that road safer, the first arc needs to be done.

55
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:55.000
That is the arc from Route 3 at the end of the Sagamore Park Road to 111 needs to be done.

56
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.500
Mitigation for that, even though there are some wetlands in there, mitigation has already been planned for.

57
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.000
The state owns a big chunk of the road.

58
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
In discussion with the DOT commissioner, what needs to be done first is a feasibility study.

59
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We're asking for an immediate status of $1 million to get a feasibility study done so that we can find out once and for all what's going on.

60
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:41.500
Hudson is unique in that it has good access to the turnpike system, and it has land on which buildings can be built.

61
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:52.000
It has an industrial park which has a 50 foot height limit which allows for high rise buildings to be built.

62
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We've already got one in the planning stage.

63
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.500
It's being discussed in the courts of course by the neighbors.

64
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:10.500
and another one that's coming up that's being discussed, which I don't know what will happen with that.

65
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.000
I can't say because I'm on the planning board.

66
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:36.500
I do know that Hudson planned ahead for the Sagamore Bridge by taking land from the new development, whether it's a small development with a Starbucks and a bank and a couple other Jersey Mikes, first Jersey Mike's in New Hampshire, good subs.

67
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.000
We mandated that they give an additional turn lane.

68
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.500
When we're ready to take it, DOT is already ready to take it.

69
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.500
So that's already with no additional cost to the state.

70
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.500
As part of the planning board decision and development stipulations.

71
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:08.000
They have a turning lane that's coming in there, so there will be two turning lanes southbound off of Route 3A.

72
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.500
This is an urgent situation.

73
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
Accidents increase.

74
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500
Traffic is increasing.

75
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:23.000
The quality of life for not only Hudson residents, but the towns previously mentioned are being affected.

76
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Jobs are coming into Hudson because we have a thriving business program, and we have space for businesses to develop and grow.

77
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We need the feasibility study done so that we can come back and say this is what's needed for this and this is what the study says can or cannot be done.

78
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So, therefore, I believe that this plan is remiss in not including $1 million for the feasibility study.

79
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I will read from a September 9, 2020 letter from the governor to the chairman of the board of selectmen, whose president was Mr.

80
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
David Morin.

81
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.500
Just one short paragraph, and I have the whole thing here.

82
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
I just lost it.

83
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:35.500
It is important to note that given our current sustained economic condition, the time frame in which project funding is available is limited and requires immediate approval by the town.

84
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.500
Well, the town's ready to go forward now.

85
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.000
It has been for a long time.

86
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.500
There's been some internal squabbling.

87
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.500
There always are.

88
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.000
You all are familiar with your own town governments.

89
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.500
You know what that's like.

90
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.000
The governor wants this as a priority.

91
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
How it didn't get put on the plan?

92
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Well, things get missed.

93
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I'm not here to give blame.

94
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We all have some idea where things happen.

95
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:22.500
But this $1 million for a feasibility study is essential so that we can get started or know what to do with it.

96
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:40.000
I will also say that there are some group of individuals, a smaller group in town, that want to take the entire state property without going through due process and make it into a park.

97
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.500
A good chunk of that land is already owned.

98
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:53.000
This feasibility study would be the key to improving the traffic flow within the next several years.

99
00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It would be the key to helping the communities previously listed, Hudson, Wyndham, Salem to a degree, Londonderry, and Litchfield.

100
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We have to get this done.

101
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We need that extra million dollars.

102
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.500
I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

103
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.500
Thank you.

104
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Representative Eaton.

105
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500
Just a quick one, Representative Eaton.

106
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.000
Any money we move in this has to be counterbalanced by something else.

107
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:53.500
The $1 million figure you have, is that something that was just pulled out of let's have a million bucks to do a study, or is it based on someone giving you an estimate of what the study would cost so we're not grabbing money out that could be used otherwise?

108
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500
Thank you.

109
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.500
It's good to see.

110
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.000
I haven't seen you in a while.

111
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Oh.

112
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.500
Well, I've already had one.

113
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:12.500
No, that's a number that is given to us by the commissioner in DOT.

114
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500
Any other questions?

115
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500
Seeing none, thank you.

116
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500
Oh, wait a minute.

117
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.500
Representative Thompson.

118
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.500
Good morning, Representative.

119
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500
Oh, wait a minute.

120
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Representative Thompson.

121
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.500
Good morning, Representative.

122
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.000
Thank you for your testimony.

123
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I noticed in these letters of recommendation there's a number of comments about the BUILD grant.

124
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.500
What will that BUILD grant cover, and will it not cover this million-dollar feasibility study?

125
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.500
That was from the 2018 bill grant application.

126
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.000
That doesn't necessarily apply currently.

127
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.500
It was included merely to show that we have support across various towns.

128
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:13.500
I would pay more attention to the NRPC, National Regional Planning Commission, and the letters from the governors as well as the two senators, sir, the two U.S.

129
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
senators.

130
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:39.000
The bill grant would include building the entire circumferential highway, which would go around Hudson from just in broad terms and without wiggles and waggles and all the stuff that's needed would go from 3A at the Sagamore Bridge right off of the turnpike over to 111.

131
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.500
Then from 111 to 102.

132
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.000
And then from 102 back to 3A in Litchfield.

133
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.500
And if you go back to the original plan, it would connect with the Henry Burke Highway in Nashua.

134
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:11.000
It's my understanding from the town engineer that the biggest objection to the plan to begin with was so many bridges in such close proximity from the Army Corps of Engineers.

135
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:32.500
So I don't think that the bridge at the end of the Henry Burke Highway over the Merrimack River will be completed because a large chunk of that traffic has been taken care of by the Pearl Harbor Survivors Bridge up in Londonderry.

136
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500
So let's not worry about that.

137
00:15:35.500 --> 00:16:06.000
But we do need to get traffic out of the center of Hudson, which is three centuries old, coming up on it, for the roads going through it are, for the most part, going through the center of town unimproved in any way, shape, or form It's an improved four lane road, low road, but the traffic capacity has exceeded that.

138
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:37.500
Of course, you know, I know traffic grows to fill the void, but if we can divert the traffic from the center of town, we take the load off of state roads that need to be maintained all the time by pushing it off onto other roads so there's a smaller flow of traffic of cars heading out towards the east of Hudson.

139
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:49.500
And that will take a big chunk of the traffic out of the center of town and the traffic hazards that are associated there.

140
00:16:49.500 --> 00:17:04.500
If you take a look at the Hudson Police accident reports, there's a large number of them that have taken place, some going south towards Kingsborough, some off Wasson Road.

141
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500
It's another story.

142
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:27.000
But they're taking Wasson Road to avoid the center of town, and as a result, you have people that are trying to make up time on a back road literal cow path, actually probably a deer path of a paved road.

143
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So this becomes vital for the vitality of the entire southern region.

144
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Okay.

145
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.500
A quick follow up Mr.

146
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500
Chairman.

147
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.000
A quick follow up, yes.

148
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Thank you.

149
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.500
of the entire southern region.

150
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.500
Okay.

151
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.500
A quick follow-up, Mr.

152
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500
Chairman.

153
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.500
A quick follow-up, yes.

154
00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:05.000
It indicates here that there's 4.5 miles of property that is going to need to be taken one way or another.

155
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.500
What portion of that does the town already own?

156
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.000
Well, the town doesn't own most of the property.

157
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
The state already owns most of the property.

158
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
They do.

159
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000
They already took most of that property, except for the small section the town took back without telling the state.

160
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Thank you very much.

161
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Representative Newman.

162
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Thank you, Mr.

163
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Chair.

164
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Thank you for taking the question.

165
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:54.500
Over the last several months, when I do travel to Hudson from North Nashua and go down Lowell Road, I've noticed, I think there are five buildings.

166
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.000
Are those apartments or condos?

167
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.500
And do you know how many there actually are?

168
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.000
And if there's going to be some traffic impact.

169
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Actually, I'm on the planning board in Hudson as well.

170
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dakota Properties put up some affordable housing right there at the top of the road, just opposite the wetlands that belong to Presentation of Mary Academy.

171
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
That building is complete.

172
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:35.500
They're awaiting the installation of some appliances before they open it up for residency in the very near future.

173
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.000
I don't, CO hasn't been issued yet, has it?

174
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.500
All right, so the first building certificate of occupancy has been built, according to the town engineer.

175
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.000
And I don't remember right off the top of my head.

176
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:15.500
The way we designed the traffic on that, however, was for southbound in, southbound out, northbound, you're going to have to go through the industrial park, come up to a traffic light and make a left-hand turn if you want to go northbound.

177
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:42.000
So we pushed the traffic away from the bottleneck area down southerly where there's several traffic lights which people can indicate, which is also the plan for the proposed 500,000 square foot warehouse right behind that building are those buildings there's two buildings 481 apartments thank you Seeing no further questions, thank you.

178
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Representative Rice.

179
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Two minutes.

180
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.500
I am always very brief and to the point.

181
00:20:50.500 --> 00:21:00.000
Representative Olery stated much of what I was going to say, but for the record, I'm Representative Kim Rice.

182
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:18.500
I represent Hillsborough 37 Hudson and Pelham, and I happen to be a Hudson resident, and I wish I could be here today as a resident to express to you the faulty traffic we have in town.

183
00:21:18.500 --> 00:22:02.000
It takes me forever forever to get home I won't leave my house after a certain time after four o'clock if I'm home I don't leave because I'm not sitting in that traffic I'm not we have the wonderful suicide lane which is a nightmare in itself but I do want to you know did want to express what representative Olery said we have you know two big projects coming to town that's bringing a lot of jobs for people, and this really needs to be addressed.

184
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.500
The residents really need some relief from this traffic.

185
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.500
And that's basically all I have to say.

186
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500
Representative Olery covered everything.

187
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500
Thanks.

188
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.500
Questions from members of the committee?

189
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:27.500
I do have one, and maybe the department might be able to answer it later when we hear from them.

190
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.500
But as you know, this whole 10-year plan is a zero-sum game.

191
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:45.000
If we take a million dollars to do this feasibility study, do you have any suggestions on which town gives up their project?

192
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
No.

193
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I don't.

194
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Sorry.

195
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:20.500
But, you know, I do want to express the importance of this job being done and, you know, the really negative impact it's having on the lives of the residents of Hudson because we do cater to the traffic from Massachusetts, from Pelham, from Londonderry, Windham, Nashua are all cutting through the town, and I'm at my wit's end.

196
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.000
So I can just imagine everyone else in town.

197
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.500
So thank you for considering it, and I really, really hope that this gets approved.

198
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500
Thank you.

199
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
Any other questions?

200
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.500
Seeing none, thank you very much, Representative Rice.

201
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.500
Moving on to a different subject.

202
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.500
Representative The Burge.

203
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.500
Thank you.

204
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.500
If you could hold up for a minute.

205
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:59.500
Representative Rulery, I was asked to remind you that you're at exec session across the hall.

206
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.500
Okay, Mr.

207
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:20.500
Chairman, members of the committee, I'm going to not take much of your time because there's somebody that's following me, the Coast County Commissioner, that will give you all the details, and I don't want to reiterate that.

208
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:39.500
But I do want to thank you for your time and patience and indulgence regarding the request being made to allow funds for the Gulf Links Road in Dixville and Colbrook, which is currently owned by the state-owned.

209
00:24:39.500 --> 00:25:00.500
However, in summary, what I would like to say is that one way to reinstate the funds for the above would be to convince a municipality, as you well know, to give up a project and redirect funds for the Balsam's initiative.

210
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:11.000
Personally, it would be suicidal for any municipality and clearly unethical on my part to request such action to be taken.

211
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:22.000
However, what is possible is to advocate for the use of funds given to the state via the American Rescue Plan Act.

212
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.500
However, this morning I received an email.

213
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:40.500
I was asking for detailed information regarding the ARP funds from the governor's office, and the commissioner, who will follow me later on regarding this road project, will clarify that.

214
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:59.000
That being said, the act does allow under economic adjustment assistance programs to help hundreds of communities nationwide to plan, build, innovate and put people back to work through the construction design and to meet local needs.

215
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
The Gulf Links Road project qualifies for such an assistance.

216
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.500
However, more clarification on the use of those funds need to come forth.

217
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:18.500
Nonetheless, the conditions should be placed for the above funding if it were to be implemented.

218
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
Thank you.

219
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.500
on the use of those funds need to come forth.

220
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:33.500
Nonetheless, the condition should be placed for the above funding if it were to be implemented.

221
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:49.000
That is, that none of the funds can be used until such times that all financial agreements are in place and in conjunction with the first shovel of dirt being turned.

222
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Thank you.

223
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I noticed that you were reading.

224
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:06.000
If you could give that to the clerk for the files, it would be useful in any future discussions we may have about this.

225
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Are there any questions of Representative LeBurge from members of the committee.

226
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Seeing none, thank you.

227
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I next call Mr.

228
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.500
Ray Gorman, Coas County Chamber.

229
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.500
It doesn't say that, but okay.

230
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:48.500
mistake oh the red lights on now we're in business okay well thank you very much for letting me speak in front of you as well as cross County Commissioner I am Colbrook selectman a four-term selectman and I I was a longtime I worked at the balsams for 32 years until it closed.

231
00:27:48.500 --> 00:28:23.500
Golf links road is a very important part of the development of the balsams it's about two miles long and it is the road that goes from the hotel to the country club it's two miles if you You go up about a third of the way, and you have Two Town Ponds, and Two Town Ponds is called that name because it's half in Cobrick and half in Dixville.

232
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.000
The rest of the way up, you're on Golf Links Road.

233
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
You're in Cobrick, leading to the golf course.

234
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.500
It's a Donald Ross signature golf course.

235
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.000
It was always very busy when we were open.

236
00:28:41.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And the potential for development along this road is significant, but it's even far more significant to the golf course that it leads to, okay, the 18-hole golf course, and has been maintained even though the hotel has been closed.

237
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:11.000
All of the golf course is in the town of Coburg, and they pay taxes to the town of Coburg.

238
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:22.500
With the significant development that will occur around the golf course, it will have a significant impact on especially the community of Coburg.

239
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:50.000
Our part of Golf Links Road, we've already worked with the developer on, And got right away things that we we have done legally to set them up to do what they need to do their developments for building homes it could be tens of millions of dollars if things go as planned with mr.

240
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000
and it could be in the next three 36 months he's talking about $35 million worth of homes.

241
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.500
They are developing the plans.

242
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.000
They have three different protocol homes that they have set up.

243
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.500
And the impact that would have on our tax base in Colbic would be significant.

244
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.500
This road we have been talking about with DOT for several years.

245
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:29.000
I believe it was about five to six years ago, we had a meeting at the Balsams.

246
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Ms.

247
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Sheehan was there.

248
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Executive Council was there as well.

249
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Biela Montang.

250
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.500
We met with and had a long conversation about two projects.

251
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:51.500
We have our Main Street project in Colbrook at that time, which is in two parts.

252
00:30:51.500 --> 00:31:00.000
And one part has already been completed, and the other part we hope to complete in 2023.

253
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And we have a meeting with DOT tomorrow morning for some of the finalization of that.

254
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And it's gone very well, and our work with DOT has gone very well.

255
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.500
So Golf Links Road is important, very important to our plans.

256
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500
Now, especially where Mr.

257
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:32.000
Otten has presented, he has a Sasha and Gold, he has protected a non-profit by the name of Provident.

258
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.500
He has come to the county with significant plans and with financial backing.

259
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:45.000
We, the county, are completely supporting that with $30 million worth of bonds.

260
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.500
Our attorneys are working together.

261
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:54.500
We had a commissioner's meeting yesterday, and everything seems to be moving along smoothly.

262
00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:08.000
So the county is doing its part to commit to the development there and what it will bring to the county and the surrounding communities like Colbrook.

263
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Golf Links Road is a key and that's it's really important and we will do anything we can to the meeting so on and so forth.

264
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I believe it was on the 10-year plan the town of Colbrook was never informed that there was that it was being taken off from the 10-year plan.

265
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.500
The town of Colbrook was never informed that it was being taken off from the 10-year plan.

266
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:52.500
One of our selectmen the other day when we were talking about this said it's been taken off.

267
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.000
I said, yes, it has.

268
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.500
And so we're looking to get back the funding for this.

269
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:10.000
the economic development it can do for the North Country, for Colbrook, and for the whole county is significant.

270
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
We need to be back on that plan.

271
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.500
The road is owned by the state.

272
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:31.500
I mean, in all my years there, the state did what it needed to do as far as patching things for us to use it in the summer.

273
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:39.500
It would be closed in the winter and we'd use it as a cross-country ski course.

274
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:55.000
And this road, as you go up it, it goes off to Nathan Pond and Mud Pond, which is an area that has significant use by snowmobilers, OHRV, hunting and fishing.

275
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
It's an area that can easily be developed.

276
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:30.000
I haven't seen any plans for that but there will be plans it accesses the main hotel to the golf course panorama golf course in all those areas which are in Colbrook which really are significant for us anything we can do to move this along we need your I'm just going to make a quick statement about my community of Colbert.

277
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Our upcoming town meeting, we have Article Number 2 is for 3.

278
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
million for improvements in our sewer.

279
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.500
We'll be borrowing about a million dollars.

280
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.000
We've got significant help with things there.

281
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
We have a water system that we're improving.

282
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.500
That's about a million dollars.

283
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.000
We'll be borrowing about $400,000.

284
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:08.500
Our community is working hard to set ourselves up to take care of the development of the balsams, which it looks like it's going to be happening.

285
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.500
We're definitely optimistic.

286
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.500
And we have another industry, APP, that's in our community.

287
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:24.500
And we're really, our community, when we brought the bond issue for our main street, passed by 90%.

288
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500
We have significant local support here.

289
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.500
Our people want to see Colbrook move ahead.

290
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:49.000
We've taken some significant blows through the years with the loss of Ethan Allen jobs, with the loss of the paper mill in Grovedon, and we've just, and the balsams, we have taken significant losses.

291
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.500
And I can tell you, once the balsams closed personally three jobs to stay in the community.

292
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.500
All right.

293
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.500
And we've got a lot of good, hard-working people there.

294
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.500
The hotel had an incredible reputation.

295
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.500
The Rubber Factory and those folks were good, hard workers.

296
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:34.000
And we need to look to you folks for some help with this Golf Links Road to get it developed because it's going to be a huge asset to the development of that Panorama of Donald Ross course into the whole development there.

297
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And I believe this can happen, and I believe you folks will help us support this.

298
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Thank you.

299
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.500
Any questions from members of the committee?

300
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500
Seeing none, thank you.

301
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.000
Any questions from members of the committee?

302
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Seeing none, thank you.

303
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Mr.

304
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.500
Mark Connors from the town of Stratham.

305
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.500
Good morning.

306
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:10.500
Chairman Graham, Vice Chairman McConkie, all members of the committee, thank you for having me today.

307
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.000
I'm here to speak on Project 41711.

308
00:37:14.000 --> 00:38:36.000
The town of Stratum is respectfully requesting that project be accelerated in the plan, and we're willing to request a separate project in Stratum, money be taken from that project to support this project project number four one seven one one is intersection improvements to bunker hill avenue and route 108 portsmouth avenue in stratum it is currently scheduled for construction in 2027 but the town would respectfully request it be moved to 2024 it's it's the town's position that this is the most important transportation safety need in our town it's been including the 10-year plan for five years after a community wide effort to have it included in the plan it's been discussed in town for decades that's why it is somewhat discouraging to the town that a different more expensive project was added to the 10-year plan by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation last year that is scheduled for construction four years earlier than the Bunker Hill Avenue intersection improvements.

309
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.500
That project, project number 4-3-2-7-2, would include safety improvements to the Route 33 corridor in both Stratum and Greenland.

310
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.000
We support safety improvements to Route 33.

311
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:58.500
However, we firmly believe that the Bunker Hill Avenue intersection improvements represent a more pressing need in our community.

312
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.000
The data is clear that the intersection is dangerous.

313
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:14.500
The police department has responded to 35 collisions there over the last 10 years, including seven accidents with injuries that required ambulance response.

314
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:25.000
There are poor sight lines at the intersection, and many residents, particularly older residents, tell us they avoid the intersection altogether.

315
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:47.000
In the fall of last year, we surveyed residents regarding the greatest transportation needs in Stratum, and we didn't even ask about the Route 33 project because it was so new to the plan it wasn't included in the 10-year plan at that time.

316
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.500
We would have asked about it, but it's come so quickly we didn't.

317
00:39:53.500 --> 00:40:03.000
The project we did ask about, the Bunker Hill Avenue intersection improvements emerged as the biggest need among residents.

318
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:13.000
One resident noted this project has been kicked down the can for over 50 years and needs to be resolved.

319
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Traffic density isn't going to decrease.

320
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:26.500
Another noted, I fear someone will eventually be killed there and then we'll ask ourselves why we didn't do something sooner.

321
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.500
Many residents don't simply avoid the intersection altogether.

322
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:43.000
It can take like a three-mile route to avoid the intersection and get to a signalized intersection down where Route 101 comes in in stratum.

323
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
A lot of people tell us that they do that.

324
00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:02.500
In our view, this is a project where there's a rare kind of consensus among town government and the residents of Stratum that this is our biggest transportation need.

325
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.500
We support a corridor study of the Route 33 corridor.

326
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.000
We also understand the Town of Greenland is supportive of that.

327
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:32.000
The 10-year plan does include an engineering study, $125,000 engineering study that's slated for 2024, which to us that makes even less sense because why are you undertaking an engineering study before you're planning a major construction project?

328
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
The major construction project is slated for 2023.

329
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000
The engineering study of the corridor is slated after that project is already started for construction.

330
00:41:44.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So as I mentioned, the town of Stratum would be supportive of reallogating approximately $14.4 million projected cost of the Bunker Hill intersection improvements from the Route 33 project so that Bunker Hill intersection improvements could be completed in 2024 or sooner.

331
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:17.000
As I mentioned, we do not doubt the safety improvements are in order for the 233 corridor and we're supportive generally of that project.

332
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:28.000
However, we'd suggest that a comprehensive study of the corridor might make more sense before we schedule a major construction project there.

333
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Thank you very much for your time today.

334
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.500
I'd be happy to take any questions you have.

335
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.500
Thank you.

336
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.000
Any questions from members of the committee?

337
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Seeing none, thank you.

338
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.500
If you could leave your written testimony for the file, it would be appreciated by the clerk.

339
00:42:52.500 --> 00:43:03.000
I have no further pink cards, but I am sure that members of the committee have some questions of the department.

340
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:16.000
From what we've heard this morning, if the commissioner and or her staff would be willing to entertain questions from the committee, I would appreciate it.

341
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Bring as many as you would need up.

342
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Commissioner, if we could just kind of take them in the order we heard them today.

343
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
We heard first about stratum and last about stratum and their proposal.

344
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:48.000
If you don't have an answer or comment about that at this time, we can wait till this afternoon at our executive session to talk about that proposal.

345
00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I would prefer that we defer the conversation to this afternoon because this was really the first time we'd heard about this request to change the order of the projects.

346
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:15.000
The one thing I will say is that the project that is slated to move forward in 2023 is much further along in design.

347
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:27.500
So we will take a look at the timing and the readiness of both projects and bring that information back to the committee this afternoon.

348
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.500
I would appreciate that.

349
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:44.000
And so for the committee, we'll hold off on the Stratham discussion until our executive session this afternoon, and the commissioner can bring back some additional information to us.

350
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Hudson Circumvential Highway.

351
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And the request for a $1 million feasibility study, do you have $1 million laid around to pay for this?

352
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.500
So we have been looking at the available balances in each fiscal year.

353
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:17.500
I'm going to be honest with the cost increases that we're seeing in terms of commodities and just the cost of construction in general, we are very tight in 2023.

354
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:31.000
We do have a lot more flexibility in 2025, but we are taking a close look to see if there's any way to make some funding available.

355
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.500
Maybe we could make a smaller amount available in 23 and then complete the study in 2024.

356
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:48.500
But our caution is that, as I said, the cost of doing business right now has been increasing.

357
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:58.500
And with all the projects we have programmed, if we see additional cost escalation, that will further diminish our capacity.

358
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.500
More representative Jack.

359
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.500
Thank you, Mr.

360
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.500
Chairman.

361
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.500
Thank you, Commissioner.

362
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:14.500
What color would this money have to be in it, if you know what I mean?

363
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:19.000
We do believe that the feasibility study is warranted.

364
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.500
The circumferential project has been talked about for many, many years.

365
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:57.500
The Hudson boulevard portion which is just the southern portion is something that has come up in several 10-year plan cycles and we were a little surprised that it wasn't elevated as a need earlier in the 10-year plan process and so we we do believe there's merit to taking a close look and determining whether or not there is an alignment that could be permitted.

366
00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:05.000
Previously, this was going to be a turnpike-funded project when it was the full circumferential.

367
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:31.000
If the state is making the determination that we don't intend, at least in the next 10 years, to construct the full circumferential, if we're looking at just that southern portion, it probably would be inappropriate to use turnpike funds, which is why we'd propose using federal funds for this particular study.

368
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.500
Once again, you've said that you are going to be looking at availability of funds.

369
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:46.500
we have to come to some kind of resolution starting this afternoon with the 10-year plan.

370
00:47:46.500 --> 00:48:15.500
If you do not have something by that point to go into an amendment to the bill, I'm not sure what the committee's pleasure will be, but if you could bring something back this afternoon to the executive session on what you think you can do, and if the answer is you can't, then be honest with us.

371
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.000
That's all that any of us ask.

372
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:27.500
Like I said, we could probably accommodate this easily in 2025, but doing it sooner is challenging.

373
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.500
That's what we're taking a close look at.

374
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.500
Thank you.

375
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.500
Members of the committee, Representative Thompson.

376
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:48.000
If you can get to it in 2025, how long is that going to take with the feasibility study and get ready to?

377
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.500
I guess the question, my direct question is, how soon before these people see some relief from completed construction?

378
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.500
Just a guess.

379
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:13.500
So it is unclear whether or not we could secure the environmental permits to build the project on the alignment that was originally proposed for the circumferential highway.

380
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:22.500
The reason the circumferential did not move forward was because EPA could not support the project as proposed.

381
00:49:22.500 --> 00:50:06.000
So this feasibility study would look at, you know, if we're only building a two-lane roadway at this boulevard instead of a four-lane turnpike what would the impacts be and how would we mitigate those impacts as well as look at potential alternative alignments that might be more palatable so that work would probably take a good 12 to 18 months if you include the time to secure a consultant to help us with that work and then of course we don't know what the would be.

382
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Depending on the alternative and the feasibility, we'd have to advance the design of that solution.

383
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:58.500
Order of magnitude-wise, when the town was pursuing the bill grant, which was just to construct the southern portion of the circumferential, just the Hudson Boulevard that we're describing, it was around $40 to $50 million was the estimate for for that construction cost so we'd have to secure those dollars in a future 10-year plan cycle to fund the project as well so looking at five to eight years i'm sorry an additional five to eight years probably um before you get get to the completion of construction.

384
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.500
Okay.

385
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.500
Thank you.

386
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.500
Representative Ebel.

387
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.500
Thank you, Mr.

388
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.500
Chairman, and thank you, Commissioner, for being here.

389
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:22.000
I was curious whether this project was ranked as a very high priority by the RPC that represents Hudson through their TAP process.

390
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:41.500
So this project was not submitted as a candidate for any of the programs like TAP or CMAC and it did not get submitted as a candidate for consideration when the Regional Planning Commission did their call for projects.

391
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.500
Follow-up.

392
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:55.000
So in preparing the initial draft of the 10-year plan for review by Gasset, the Governor didn't include this project in the draft.

393
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.500
Is that the way the, do I understand the process correctly?

394
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:15.000
In the draft plan that the Department prepared back in the summertime, we did not include it because it had not been identified as a Regional Planning Commission priority.

395
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:48.500
When this project was in the 10-year plan previously, it was intended to be funded by the state the request that we had received from the town of hudson was to partner with them they intended to pursue the bill grant application and should they be successful and have secured those dollars the department was then authorized to work with the town because we own the property.

396
00:52:48.500 --> 00:53:07.000
We would have been able to review the submissions as their design consultant advanced the project, but there was no federal turnpike or state funding allocated to the project when it was previously in the 10-year plan.

397
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So moving forward, they didn't secure the grant, so we did not include it in the initial draft of the 10-year plan.

398
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.500
The councillors did not include this project either, and you're correct, the governor did not add the project-year plan.

399
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:38.000
The counselors did not include this project either, and you're correct, the governor did not add the project to the plan.

400
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.500
Further questions on this issue?

401
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.000
Moving on to the next one, Gulf Links Road.

402
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
I know it was in a previous plan.

403
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Could you identify what in that plan was the source of funding for Golf Links Road?

404
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
At that time, it was anticipated that we would fund the work with the Betterment program.

405
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000
And if we were to include it now, where would the money have to come from?

406
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:33.000
So as I have described at previous work sessions, we're in a different place today when it comes to our state highway revenues, and we have seen declines, especially during the COVID pandemic period in available funding for betterment projects.

407
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:50.000
And so if there was a decision made to fund this through those traditional sources, that would be at the expense of other paving projects that we anticipate doing through the betterment funding source.

408
00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:06.500
That is why we've suggested that perhaps an alternate source of funding be pursued, because we really would not want to see our capacity diminished when it comes to our overall paving program.

409
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:15.500
In order of magnitude-wise, we spend about 20 million, 20 to 22 million of betterment funding on paving.

410
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:24.000
And this project we anticipate would cost probably around $2.5 million to $3.5 million in today's dollars.

411
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Representative Ewell.

412
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Thank you.

413
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
I have a similar question to the question that I just asked about Hudson.

414
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
You know, there's a real process that these things follow.

415
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
It's kind of set in stone.

416
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:51.500
Where did this rank or did it rank in the recommendations of the RPC for that area?

417
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:57.500
So once again, this was not brought forward as an RPC recommendation.

418
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:04.500
However, the RPCs are typically identifying projects that would be advanced with federal funds.

419
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:16.000
We have such limited state funds that the department puts together the paving plans and determines how best to use the betterment funding.

420
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:28.000
So I'm not surprised that this wasn't identified as an RPC priority because it's not a section of roadway that's eligible for federal funds.

421
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Thank you.

422
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.500
Further questions from members of the committee?

423
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.500
Representative Jack.

424
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.500
Jack.

425
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.500
Thank you again, Mr.

426
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.500
Chairman.

427
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:47.500
It's probably only right to ask us about the stratum project also.

428
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:56.500
The RPC phase, the town mentioned that there was another project they wanted to take the founts from.

429
00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.000
They were a little surprised that it was advanced.

430
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And if we could get the information on how that got in at the RPC phase, that might be helpful.

431
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Excuse me.

432
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.500
Bill Cass, the Assistant Commissioner.

433
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:28.000
The project that was added was a result of some safety studies working with both Stratum and Greenland, and Senator Sherman was also very involved.

434
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.500
He had spearheaded some dialogue about concerns with access to Route 33 on that segment.

435
00:57:35.500 --> 00:58:00.000
So as part of those discussions through the Highway Safety Improvement Program, in conjunction with the paving program, we looked at that section of highway and said that we could look at adding a center turning lane through that in conjunction with some upcoming resurfacing that was going on.

436
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:14.500
So one of the reasons that it is accelerated or that it got included earlier was because it is coordinated with some paving work and resurfacing of Route 33.

437
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:31.500
There needs to be some work to beef up the shoulders to allow some of the incremental widening to put a center turn lane to improve safety and improve turning movements at those corridors.

438
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:52.500
in conjunction with the paving program and the safety program, and that it doesn't have the external impacts that the Bunker Hill Road intersection does in terms of right-of-way and other potential historic and environmental impacts that need to be dealt with.

439
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:58.000
It was easier to put it in sooner rather than later.

440
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Representative Ewell.

441
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Thank you.

442
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:20.500
Could you just clarify whether all these concerns were raised at the Gasset level of review of the 10-year plan, and if so, I guess it would appear that the Executive Counselors elected not to add them.

443
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.500
So I'll go through each project.

444
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:29.500
So Hudson, we did not receive any testimony during the Gasset phase.

445
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:42.000
During one of our work sessions, you might recall that we had a list of all the projects that we specifically were drawing attention to.

446
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.000
So on that list, there was both the Balsams Project as well as the Hudson Boulevard.

447
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:58.000
So we did not receive any testimony in the Gasset phase for either of those projects.

448
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:28.500
But the conclusion of the Gasset phase, because there had been some developments in terms of the Balsams team securing funding to advance their project, Councillor Kenney did indicate that it might be time to revisit Golf Links Road, but that was all just emerging information at the time that we were working on the Gasset draft of the 10-year plan.

449
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.500
And I would say I know Stratum did come up.

450
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:41.000
We had a lot of discussion with Council of Stevens about it and the concern.

451
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We know that it's a priority.

452
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:56.500
It is in the 10-year plan and we are committed to working on it beginning when the funding is programmed with the engineering next year.

453
01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:08.000
I'll go out a little bit and say if it can be accelerated, I think that would be our goal given the concerns.

454
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But we also know that there are other issues there more there more than just traffic because it is a historic area and there will be right-of-way impacts, and those things typically take time to work through in developing a preferred alternative and identifying those impacts.

455
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.500
We did in Stratum look at if there was a short-term immediate fix that we could do.

456
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:59.500
We did look at, I wouldn't address the whole issue, we did look at with some of the safety funds if a right turn lane could be added within the right of way, something that could be done more immediately.

457
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:21.000
But as we looked at that and the impacts of that, it did get slope impacts onto historic properties, which would have gone into more evaluation to evaluate it, and it wasn't feasible to do the quick implementation of the right turn lane.

458
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.500
And the project got programmed, and we're anxious to get started to work on it.

459
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Any further questions on these issues that were raised by members of the legislature or the public this morning to the department?

460
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.000
I do have one other thing, Commissioner.

461
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I know your staff shared with me a list of municipal bridges.

462
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:59.500
If we could pass that out at this point, or were you going to wait until bring it in this afternoon?

463
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:06.500
We had thought that it would be more appropriate to bring it this afternoon.

464
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.000
Okay, we'll do it then.

465
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Any further questions of the department?

466
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.500
Again, thank you for your time and consideration of our our meandering questions here, Commissioner.

467
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
We appreciate it.

468
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:30.500
Is there anybody who has not testified on House Bill 2022 who wishes to testify at this time?

469
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:39.500
Is there anybody who has spoken once that wishes to speak a second time on House Bill 2022?

470
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.000
Seeing none, the public hearing is closed.

471
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.500
For members of the committee, I once again misjudged time a little bit.

472
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:55.500
Our executive session is on this bill is at 1.15 this afternoon.

473
01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:21.000
The commissioner has agreed to bring in a couple of items of information for our consideration at that time we'll also look at what we an amendment that was prepared based on artists our straw discussions last week and we'll go on from there we will see how far we get.

474
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Probably not going to finish today.

475
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Because we'll see because we have to deal with all of these questions and then get them put into an amendment if we accept any of the suggestions to include the one that the commissioner is going to bring in.

476
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.500
So we have some time.

477
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.000
Be back here at 1.15.

478
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
My apologies to the members of the committee about having three hours to kill.

479
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Thank you all.

480
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Thank you.

620
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Thank you.

621
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Thank you.

622
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Thank you.

623
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Thank you.

624
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Thank you.

625
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Thank you.

626
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Thank you.

627
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Thank you.

628
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Thank you.

629
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Thank you.

630
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Thank you.

631
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Thank you.

632
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Thank you.

633
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Thank you.

634
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Thank you.

635
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Thank you.

636
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Thank you.

637
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Thank you.

638
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Thank you.

639
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Thank you.

640
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Thank you.

641
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Thank you.

642
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Thank you.

643
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Thank you.

644
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Thank you.

645
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Thank you.

646
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Thank you.

647
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Thank you.

648
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Thank you.

649
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:47.500
The time being 1.15, I'd like to call the executive session on House Bill 2022 to order.

650
01:10:47.500 --> 01:11:04.500
First, I would like to point out that what I passed out to the members of the committee is Amendment 0496H, which is all that we agreed to last week in our work sessions.

651
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:12.000
This will be what we build on today, whether we add or subtract from it.

652
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:37.500
And I'm stalling, waiting for the commissioner to come back because she was going to bring some other information But we do have one thing Representative McConkie has a proposed amendment that he'd like to bring up at this point And while he's passing it out, there will be dead silence.

653
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500
Thank you.

654
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.500
Everybody but me there, Vice Chair.

655
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500
I'm Senator McConkie.

656
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
Thank you, Mr.

657
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500
Chairman.

658
01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.000
Thanks for the indulgence by the committee.

659
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I have an item I would like to add to the 10-year plan that is not a project.

660
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It does not bump anything that's in there.

661
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.500
it would simply be a footnote that would be added into the report.

662
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:20.500
The committee has done this previously to put something small in for future expansion or something another time.

663
01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:47.000
I have a, just outside my district, I have Route 15 153 starts in Wakefield runs to Conway the selectmen from Wakefield Effingham freedom and eaton have all approached me and the traffic bureau wanting to think into the future of how to manage the increase in traffic which is tremendously tremendously higher.

664
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Segmented by GPS, it's a parallel road to Route 16.

665
01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And with all the work that was done on Route 16 of bridges and so forth, the public was directed through 153, and they've never left.

666
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So it's a two-lane road with minimal to no shoulders.

667
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.500
Speed limits are 35 to 45 miles an hour.

668
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:40.500
And what I'm asking to do is just simply a footnote, and for some that didn't get it, I would direct the Department of Transportation to report annually to the Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee the following data for Route 153 from the Wakefield Town Line to Eaton Conway Line.

669
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:57.000
Traffic counts by town with an average speed, road conditions to include shoulders, accident data is by location, and correspondences to the department from towns and citizens with safety concerns in this corridor.

670
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:10.000
One of the major safety concerns that keep coming through is the school buses don't have adequate place to stop and traffic running up on them.

671
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:39.500
So I have been also not only with the traffic bureau with executive counselor Kenny the other selectmen I mentioned I'm sorry I've got something in my mouth here to form we will form on our own a town committee to discuss these issues and then work with the Planning Commission for the next round of the 10-year plan.

672
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.500
So it's simply a footnote to be put into DOT.

673
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:55.500
I discussed it briefly with the Commissioner earlier and did not seem to have resistance, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

674
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.000
This is an annual requirement?

675
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Yes, sir.

676
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Any questions of Representative McConkie on this proposal?

677
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Representative Ebel.

678
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So thank you for bringing this forward, Representative.

679
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.500
I'm familiar with that route.

680
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:40.000
is there a cost associated with any of this except for maybe the traffic counts or most of it they might be doing anyway right yes thank you representative evil the most of it is being collected and I will coordinate with the planning commission in the area on the traffic counts and so forth.

681
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.500
We're just trying to get it into a central database and let the towns bring it forward.

682
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.500
Yeah, we are.

683
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:58.500
You've heard Representative McConkie's proposal for an addition to the committee amendment on House Bill 2022.

684
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.500
Is there any, what is the will of the committee?

685
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.500
Representative Eaton moves, Representative McConkie seconds.

686
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:14.000
This is a straw poll because it will have to go into the committee amendment.

687
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.500
Does the commissioner have anything to say about it?

688
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
Thank you.

689
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:25.500
We always check because you've got to do the work.

690
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Like I said, this is a straw poll.

691
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:33.500
It will be incorporated into a committee amendment.

692
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:41.000
All those in favor of incorporating what Representative McConkie is proposing signify by saying aye.

693
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Aye.

694
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Opposed nay.

695
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The ayes have it, and it will go into the committee amendment.

696
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Second item I'd like to bring up, which is Golf Links Road.

697
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:07.000
What is the pleasure of the committee on that issue, since we've had long discussion and public comment on it?

698
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Representative McConkie.

699
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

700
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Chairman.

701
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.500
I understand the need, but Thank you.

702
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500
Representative McConkie.

703
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500
Representative McConkie.

704
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500
Representative McConkie.

705
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.500
Representative McConkie.

706
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
Representative McConkie.

707
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500
Representative McConkie.

708
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
Representative McConkie.

709
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.500
Representative McConkie.

710
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.500
Representative McConkie.

711
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.500
Representative McConkie.

712
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500
Representative McConkie.

713
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500
Representative McConkie.

714
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500
Representative McConkie.

715
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.500
Representative McConkie.

716
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500
Representative McConkie.

717
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500
Representative McConkie.

718
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500
Representative McConkie.

719
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.500
Representative McConkie.

720
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.500
Representative McConkie.

721
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.500
Representative McConkie.

722
01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.500
Representative McConkie.

723
01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.500
Representative McConkie.

724
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.500
Representative McConkie.

725
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Representative McConkie.

726
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.500
Representative McConkie.

727
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
Representative McConkie.

728
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.500
Representative McConkie.

729
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Representative McConkie.

730
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
Representative McConkie.

731
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:25.500
Funding which might be possible for this project Thank you is there are there any other comments or is there another motion?

732
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500
It wasn't a motion.

733
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:42.500
It was a statement of fact that he does not support it and unless somebody brings forward a positive motion It will not be included Is there a positive motion?

734
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.000
Seeing none, thank you all.

735
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:55.500
Now I think we probably do need to have the commissioner be able to answer some questions on the next couple.

736
01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:17.500
We heard earlier this today from the representative from Stratum, as well as the planning agent for the town of Stratum about trying to do something with two projects that are in the 10-year plan to do anything with that proposal at this time.

737
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.500
Seeing none, it will not be brought up.

738
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:26.000
Unless, no, I'm not even going to ask you.

739
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's a policy decision.

740
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Did you look at trying to do any of that?

741
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:49.500
It is last minute, and it might be better to wait until the Senate has it so that you can actually do all the number crunching on changing projects and moving money around.

742
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:58.500
So we talked about it during the recess, and the information that Bill Cass had shared is accurate.

743
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:02.500
These two projects were initiated through different avenues.

744
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:47.000
The project that's slated to go to construction in 2023 is a minor improvement that does not require significant right-of-way or environmental permitting and is associated with a resurfacing contract so it's very different scope that's why we're able to do that work next year we did take a look at the timing of the funding for the project that they would like to accelerate and as bill said you, we can't commit to doing things sooner based on our current schedule and our current understanding of the scope.

745
01:20:47.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But certainly if we can get through the design and permitting process more quickly, we would look to move that project into construction when it's ready, not necessarily when the funding is currently programmed in the 10-year plan.

746
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:20.500
So we have made the commitment to advance that project as fast as we can, given the safety concerns at that location, but the permitting will dictate the schedule.

747
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.500
Thank you, Commissioner.

748
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:39.000
And just for everybody who may be listening over the live stream, the Commissioner does have quite a bit of latitude funding dependent on moving projects up as permitting and other things happen.

749
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.500
So this is not an unusual situation for the department to be in.

750
01:21:45.500 --> 01:22:01.000
Yes, I think for the benefit of the new members, we've talked about this briefly, but every year we have opportunities to access additional federal funds through a process called redistribution.

751
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
We honor the priorities in the 10-year plan.

752
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:14.000
So based on readiness, we then evaluate which projects we have that could utilize those additional federal dollars.

753
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Of course, we have to look at the different categories of funding.

754
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:34.500
So we still use the 10-year plan and this process to set the priority, but whatever is ready, we do try to accelerate should we receive additional federal funds.

755
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500
Thank you.

756
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:51.000
Unless somebody from the committee has a different approach and wants to make a motion, the projects as outlined in the current draft 10-year plan will stay the same.

757
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.500
Is there any motion on the part?

758
01:22:54.500 --> 01:23:00.000
Seeing none, they will stay as they are in the draft.

759
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.500
Now to the harder one.

760
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.500
Hudson.

761
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:13.000
So as I shared this morning, we've been taking a really close look at fiscal year 23.

762
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:32.500
And while we have a constrained 10-year plan, of course, we have a certain amount of contingency associated with each project, but the projects slated to be advanced in 23 are much more further along in terms of design.

763
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:38.000
That's why they're good candidates to advance in that time frame.

764
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And we are very subscribed when it comes to the 23 year.

765
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So what we currently have as a recommendation is to make $250,000 available in fiscal year 24 and then $750,000 available in fiscal year 25 to complete the feasibility study.

766
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The estimated cost was $1 million.

767
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.500
So that's what we've found so far.

768
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:13.500
We'll keep looking and maybe in the Senate phase be able to move things up sooner.

769
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:25.000
But should the committee want to entertain this request, we do believe that we can make some funding available in those two years.

770
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.500
But we still caveat that we're seeing costs go up, an escalation on our projects.

771
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:39.000
So we are tapping into some of that contingency that we'd set aside.

772
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.500
But that's currently what we think we could accommodate.

773
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:56.000
And I think that we briefly talked about language on what the feasibility study would be to include in here along with funding by year.

774
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.500
Were you able to get that done?

775
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:07.000
Yes, we have a suggested amendment that we can pass out for the committee's .

776
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
If you would, please.

777
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And we'll take a minute for the committee to look at it before we take action on it.

778
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
If any.

779
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Thank you.

780
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.500
Representative McConkie and the chair recognizes Representative Mills Thank you Mr.

781
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:50.000
Chair I only had a question for the DOT as to what programs are called non-par we're not familiar with that one and we saw in an old 10 year plan this project listed as an individual and it had been funded with non-par funds.

782
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.500
So non-par is an abbreviation for non-participating.

783
01:25:53.500 --> 01:26:08.500
So I had, I believe, shared this morning when this project was introduced into the 10-year plan originally, there was no federal Turnpike or state funds allocated to the project.

784
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:20.000
At that time, it was anticipated that the town would pursue the bill grant that was referenced this morning during the public hearing.

785
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And so when the project was added to the 10-year plan, it was purely to give the department the authorization to work with Hudson, review their design submittals, and give them feedback.

786
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
We would not have been managing the project.

787
01:26:40.000 --> 01:27:00.500
So that's why the suggested language for this feasibility study is to reintroduce the project but also amend the scope to reflect that the Department is now conducting the feasibility study and that we are going to be using federal funds.

788
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500
Thank you.

789
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:11.000
Any other questions or discussion on the motion to include the Hudson Project in the committee amendment?

790
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I'll see you soon.

791
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:21.500
Any other questions or discussion on the motion to include the Hudson project in the committee amendment?

792
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
Representative Eaton.

793
01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:33.500
In the feasibility study, would that also include the possibility of having this project be included in the turnpike system?

794
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:39.000
At this point, we're not contemplating evaluating the full circumferential highway.

795
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.500
This would be to include only the Hudson Boulevard in the 10-year plan, which would not be Turnpike funded.

796
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.000
This would be federally funded.

797
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Thank you.

798
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.500
Any other comments or questions?

799
01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:10.000
Seeing none, again, this is a straw poll on whether or not to include the proposed amendment on the Hudson Project into the committee amendment on House Bill 2022.

800
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
All those in favor signify by saying aye.

801
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Aye.

802
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Opposed, nay.

803
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.500
The ayes have it and it will be included.

804
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:31.000
Commissioner, I believe you had another amendment that you were going to bring forward about municipal bridges?

805
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Yes.

806
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Or how do you want to handle it?

807
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.500
Yes, we can pass out the amendment for the bridges next.

808
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:47.000
I did that because it's in front of me.

809
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That's right.

810
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
So where to begin?

811
01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:17.000
As you recall, the bipartisan infrastructure law or the iija was passed um towards the end of the gasset phase and so while we tried to program all of the additional dollars that were going to be made available we did not yet have rules and guidelines concerning all of the programs.

812
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:35.500
And so we made our best guess in terms of which existing projects that were part of the State Aid Bridge Program, which is a state-funded program, would be eligible to accelerate with these additional federal dollars.

813
01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:44.000
A couple of weeks ago, the Federal Highway Administration issued formal guidance for the new bridge program.

814
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
We've been reviewing all of the projects that were selected.

815
01:29:49.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Before you is some language to specify of the existing projects enrolled in the State bridge program which ones we would anticipate moving from the State Aid Bridge Program into this new, what we call mobile.

816
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.500
It's a municipally owned bridge program funded specifically with the new bridge money.

817
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:27.500
So we're receiving $225 million over five years, essentially $45 million per year, dedicated to bridges, and 15% of that is to be used for municipally owned bridges.

818
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.500
And so that's what we're doing.

819
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:35.500
We went through all of the state aid bridge projects.

820
01:30:35.500 --> 01:31:20.000
Now, one of the important things that you should be aware of is in New Hampshire, we define a bridge as anything with a span greater than 10 feet, but the federal definition is bridges with a span greater than 20 feet so there are many projects in the state a bridge program that yes they're municipally owned but they don't meet the federal definition of a bridge and so we've gone through carefully and made sure that we've identified which project belongs and so that's what's before you.

821
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:33.500
Questions from members of the committee about the changes in funding of municipal bridges and the years that it is anticipated that the projects will be done.

822
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:43.500
You'll note that they are all relatively soon because the additional money runs out in five years, if I'm correct.

823
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.000
We get five years' worth of funding.

824
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
The last year's funding does not expire in that year.

825
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.500
We have three years to spend it.

826
01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:04.000
But yes, our goal is to accelerate projects that were already in the State A Bridge Program.

827
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So while we have a longer...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

828
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
just where you notice that they are all relatively soon.

829
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
That is a reflection of the advancement of the projects.

830
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000
That was one of the goals through the Gasset process.

831
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:34.500
And this list reflects just a more detailed, appropriate funding that we didn't have the time to do at the end of the Gasset process.

832
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.500
Thank you.

833
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.500
Any questions on this?

834
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.500
Representative Thompson.

835
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.000
Can you define municipal bridge for me?

836
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I mean, you said the span, but I can think of one in particular in my town that has needed replacement for many years.

837
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The town finally voted to do that, hired a designer, an engineering firm, and it came up so expensive the town couldn't afford to do it.

838
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:38.500
And I think at the time it was declared that buses shouldn't travel over the road, but they have no option they still do I'm wondering if that's so the state a bridge program was a state funded program it was really first come first serve and so over the years the department has worked with communities, identified projects.

839
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:49.500
A couple of years ago now, we went through all of the existing projects that were in the State Aid Bridge Program.

840
01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:56.000
We more thoroughly looked at the scope and the estimates for those projects.

841
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And as a result, we realized that we were actually slightly oversubscribed.

842
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:10.000
We adjusted the timing of those projects to more accurately reflect when we could deliver them.

843
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
But basically, we were fully subscribed out through 2028, 2027?

844
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
28.

845
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:27.000
This opportunity we now have with the additional federal funds will allow us to accelerate a lot of those projects.

846
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:38.500
And so what we anticipate doing is two years from now, when we're doing the next 10-year plan update, we'll do a solicitation.

847
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:56.500
And with the additional dollars that have been freed up by using federal funds, we'll start to program other bridges that we can tackle in those out years with the additional capacity that we'll now have.

848
01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:09.500
What we've been talking about through the Executive Council phase and the Gasset phase is changing how we conduct that solicitation to make it more equitable.

849
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:15.000
Like I said, the old program was first come, first served.

850
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.500
We have some communities who happen to be, based on geography, bridge rich.

851
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:39.500
They have a disproportionate number of bridges for the size of their population, so we're going to try and come up with a criteria that allows us to administer this program in a more equitable fashion.

852
01:35:39.500 --> 01:36:00.500
But we need a little bit of time to do that, So the goal would be to work on that criteria, consult with the regional planning commissions and with the legislature, and then we'll program more bridge projects two years from now.

853
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:13.000
And to be honest, with this additional federal funding, we're going to be really working hard with the municipalities to accelerate all of this work.

854
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:30.000
But it will clear the deck, so to speak, of all the legacy projects and allow us to start working with communities who have needs that we couldn't meet with the existing state revenues.

855
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Follow up, Mr.

856
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Chairman.

857
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
So how do we get on the list?

858
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Well, that will be the thing.

859
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.500
So any bridge over 10 feet would be eligible for the state- program.

860
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:56.500
For off system federal funds, it's any bridge over 20 feet and we will be developing a solicitation.

861
01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:07.500
So probably two years from now or 18 months from now approximately that you'd have an opportunity to submit your candidate projects.

862
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:12.000
But that would be for funding probably beyond 2026.

863
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Thank you very much.

864
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Representative Edgar.

865
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Thank you, Mr.

866
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Chairman.

867
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Thank you, Commissioner.

868
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:31.500
On the 19th of January, you handed out a great handout, and it showed us the IIJA funding categories.

869
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:44.500
And for the bridges, you show like $225 million there, and then you later on have a list of what you're going to apply it to.

870
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:48.500
Is there more monies than the $225 now?

871
01:37:48.500 --> 01:38:05.000
Because obviously the list you just handed out is great, and it shows probably twice as many as you had on the list that you handed out with the handout on the 19th.

872
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.500
So did the amount of money expand?

873
01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:12.000
The amount of money did not increase.

874
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:21.500
We've just done a deeper dive into each project and made sure that it's eligible for the different categories.

875
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:35.000
So this document more fully explains which projects are staying in the State Abridge Program, which projects are moving into the new what we call mobile program.

876
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.500
In other words, they're funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law bridge money, that $225 million.

877
01:38:42.500 --> 01:39:05.000
And then we have some projects that were always going to be federally funded, which would be funded through what's called the Mo Bridge Program, which is from our from our core federal formula funds, we have a municipally owned bridge rehab and replacement program.

878
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.500
So we have old state aid bridge, state funds.

879
01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:14.000
We have formula bridge money, which is Mo Bridge.

880
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And then we have the new infrastructure law one time money, which is mobile.

881
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:33.500
And so to make sure that you all fully understood which bridge was going to be in which program, we're providing this more comprehensive list.

882
01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
That's great.

883
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
Thank you.

884
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
Any further questions?

885
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
Representative Eaton.

886
01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:46.500
Just please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

887
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:55.500
My understanding is when municipalities want the bridge aid, they go out and they do the bridge design.

888
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.500
And I think some can get Thank you.

889
01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.500
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

890
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:12.500
My understanding is when municipalities want the bridge aid, they go out and they do the bridge design.

891
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:17.500
And I think some can get more extravagant than others.

892
01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:33.500
Is there any way for DOT to rein in what a cost or design might be versus getting something that's precast or a box culvert for a small bridge or a 20-footer?

893
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:38.000
Or can they pretty much do whatever they want?

894
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I'm just thinking, are there ways to get economies of scale for this to go further?

895
01:40:46.000 --> 01:41:05.500
So one of our concerns is that when we convert some of these projects from state funded to federal funds, the cost of the project will actually go up because we have to meet all of the federal requirements.

896
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:18.000
Now, we're not placing any additional burden on the municipality from a financial perspective because the infrastructure law allows us to allocate 100% federal funds.

897
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So these communities who were enrolled in the State A Bridge Program, they would have been following state standards, but they would have been responsible for a 20% cash match to the state funds.

898
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:51.500
If we're enrolling a project now in the federal program, following the federal requirements means more construction inspection and some higher overhead costs but the benefit is they'll have zero match to provide.

899
01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
It'll be 100% federal.

900
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500
Thank you.

901
01:41:55.500 --> 01:42:01.000
And if I may, we are involved in all of these.

902
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:17.500
Typically, the initial estimate is when somebody enrolls in the State Aid Bridge Program, it would have been vetted by our bridge design to prevent some of the either low-balling or inaccurate costs.

903
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:36.500
It's still a very conceptual project and then then the municipalities manage it from them they hire an engineer and they develop the concepts and stuff but every step of the way it is reviewed by department staff.

904
01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:48.000
And usually it ends up, it's not extravagant things that the town is looking to do, because they do have a 20% match.

905
01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's usually environmental type of things that a bridge ends up getting longer than the bridge it's replacing for new requirements and things like that so representative evil i'm just trying to check my math here so if you have 225 million over five years 45 million per year 15 for municipal bridges so are you saying that we have about seven million million in federal funds annually we can use for municipal bridges?

906
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Correct.

907
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.000
So basically we've doubled the size of the State Aid Bridge Program.

908
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.500
Projects that were enrolled in the State Aid Bridge Program we received through SB367 $6.8 million annually.

909
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:49.500
and our 15% of the 45 million means we're essentially doubling the State Aid Bridge Program.

910
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:54.500
But that's not the only municipal bridges that we're doing.

911
01:43:54.500 --> 01:44:09.500
There are municipally owned bridges that are part of the national highway system, so we're also doing some of those projects, but they weren't in the State Aid Bridge Program.

912
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:14.500
They were being funded with federal funds because they're eligible.

913
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:21.000
So we are spending more than the 14 million on municipally owned bridges.

914
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:38.000
But essentially when it comes to the off system bridges, the ones that aren't considered part of the national highway system, we've essentially doubled our capacity with the federal funds and the state funds.

915
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Great, Thank you.

916
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Representative McConkie moves that the proposed amendment on municipal-owned bridges and how it's being funded and be incorporated into the committee amendment on House Bill 2022.

917
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Representative Eaton seconds.

918
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.500
Is there any further discussion?

919
01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
Thank you.

920
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:05.000
and be incorporated into the committee amendment on House Bill 2022.

921
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Representative Eaton seconds.

922
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.500
Is there any further discussion?

923
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:14.500
Seeing none, all those in favor signify by saying aye.

924
01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.500
Aye.

925
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.500
Opposed, nay.

926
01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.500
It will be incorporated.

927
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.000
That was all I had.

928
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.500
I know you were going to look at a couple other things, Commissioner.

929
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:37.000
So we have one more amendment that I'd like to spend some time going through.

930
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Our apologies.

931
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.500
We brought forward an amendment, some suggested language at the last work session.

932
01:45:45.500 --> 01:46:04.500
And as we've talked specifically about the circumferential in Hudson Boulevard, and we have some thoughts on perhaps a cleaner way to address potential conflicts that exist in the statutes today as it pertains to the Turnpike system.

933
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:17.000
We are currently reaching out to LBA for their endorsement of what we're doing, but we wanted to walk the committee through a suggested amendment.

934
01:46:17.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and so as Kathy's passing that out I'll give you a little bit of history so RSA 237 pertains to the Turnpike system and of course the Turnpike system predates the 10-year plan process certain sections within the statute were first introduced back in the early 70s and our 10-year plan process was implemented when governor sununu was in office in the 80s and so the department over the years has strived to make sure that the respective sections of the turnpike statute align with what's in the 10-year plan but we've come to realize that there's certain authorities that we were granted in the past that don't reflect the current projects in the 10-year plan and also certain sections of the statute were established when we were building the turnpike system it was initially being created we're not in the business of building significant portions of New Road anymore.

935
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
We're maybe modifying the limits of the Turnpike or adding smaller sections.

936
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And so we don't see the need for additional language.

937
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Really, the process that we follow through RSA 240, the 10-year plan, it adequately governs the spending of federal and state funds.

938
01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:04.500
So we believe that it would be appropriate to repeal certain sections of the statute now and just reference RSA 240.

939
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.500
Because in reality, that's the process that we follow today.

940
01:48:09.500 --> 01:50:34.000
So before you, we have some suggestions on language to strike so rsa 237 colon 2 articulates the authorities granted to the department to construct projects and you'll notice that a lot of the projects listed here are those to originally construct sections of the turnpike projects that were completed many many years ago so instead of having reference to old legacy projects we think it's appropriate going forward to purely reference the project that we intend to construct in the future and all of those articulated in the 10-year plan so for as an example things that are really redundant and should have been struck a while ago, in 237 colon 2 Roman numeral 2a, it talks about a study that was to be conducted to construct a four-lane east-west highway from 393 all the way to the Spalding Turnpike of course that project was evaluated at one point in time but it was never deemed feasible so there's a lot of redundant language in here whether it's projects that were built many years ago or projects that were just not advanced or move forward so we're suggesting that we essentially strike that entire section keeping basically the opening sentences that the commissioner with the approval of governor and council is authorized to and we are skipping all the way to what was old roman numeral nine to make other and further improvements to the turnpike system as may be required by rsa 240 which is the tenure plan otherwise we're trying to constantly update this language to match the 10-year plan bill so that would be something that would be helpful from a housekeeping perspective and then associated with that we'd want to repeal 237 colon 7.

941
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:45.000
so the way the statutes are structured colon 2 articulates the projects in section 7 it articulates the funding for each project.

942
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:51.000
So it's actually separated, which makes it harder to track as well.

943
01:50:51.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Because you'll notice in this section of the statute, you sometimes have a Roman numeral than ABC and a breakout of projects.

944
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.500
Whereas in section seven, all the funding is in one allocation.

945
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:22.500
So last time when we had met with the committee we suggested some language to increase our authorities in 237 colon 7 to match with the current 10 year plan.

946
01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:27.500
We're now thinking that that was perhaps the wrong approach.

947
01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:39.500
We perhaps should just repeal all of 237 colon 7 because all the money is programmed in the 10 year plan through RSASA 240.

948
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:56.500
So we're going to make sure we get LBA's concurrence, but this will ensure there's never any conflict between what's programmed through the 10-year plan process and what's in other sections of the statute.

949
01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:00.000
And actually, there is a conflict today.

950
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:30.000
So one of the items that was introduced in this 10-year plan was to do a feasibility study for exit 10 on the spalding turnpike if you go to 237 colon 2 roman numeral 2b it says that we're authorized to make improvements to the Spalding Turnpike by constructing exit 10, which is not what's clearly in the 10-year plan.

951
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.000
So that's why we'd like to avoid this potential issue by just eliminating this whole section.

952
01:52:38.000 --> 01:53:02.500
Like I said, we don't have any additional requirements in statute for federal or state funds, so we'd just be saying that we're going to allocate funding to projects on the Turnpike the same way that we do for the rest of the highway system and follow RSA 240.

953
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:28.500
So if we were to adopt this as part of House Bill 2022, what we had originally from you about the turnpike system funds provided would be stricken from any amendment, and we would just go with a complete rewrite of 237.2 is essentially what we're looking at, and repeal of 237.7.

954
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.500
Questions or comments from members of the committee?

955
01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.500
Representative Eaton.

956
01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:37.000
Just a quick thank you.

957
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I've advocated for 20 years, particularly to new legislators, that when you come in and you go to introduce a bill, you should have an equal obligation to find language that is obsolete and put in a bill to repeal.

958
01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000
So it's nice to see somebody trying to clean up the books.

959
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Any other?

960
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Representative Jack.

961
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:35.500
any other representative jack thank you so so i understand that in the in the committee amendment that was passed out we would now if we adopt this we delete all of section four so the motion would be to to adopt the what the commissioner just passed out and remove Section 4 from the committee amendment.

962
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:38.000
And I'll make that motion.

963
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:54.500
It's been moved by Representative Jack to amend the committee report by striking what we have currently in front of us on Turnpike System number four and insert the amended language on RSA.

964
01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:00.500
What we have currently in front of us on Turnpike System No.

965
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:11.000
4 and insert the amended language on RSA 237 on authority granted to the Commission and the repeal of RSA 237.

966
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Seven funds provided.

967
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Is there a second?

968
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Representative Abbott seconds.

969
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Any questions or discussion?

970
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
This is a big change to the RSAs.

971
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I personally think it's good at this point to clean things up because I've always got confused by why are we continuing just to update dollar amounts in the 10-year plan for the turnpike.

972
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.500
I mean, I knew why, but it was, why don't we do something about it?

973
01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:52.000
And I thank the commissioner for bringing this forward.

974
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Anybody else?

975
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Any further comments?

976
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:21.500
Again, it's a straw poll to accept the proposed amendment to House Bill 2022 as moved by Representative Jack that under our current committee amendment, we would strike Section 4 and insert the proposed amendment provided to us by the committee, I mean by the commissioner on RSA 237-2 and 237-7.

977
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.500
Are you ready for the question?

978
01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:32.000
All those in favor of inserting that into the committee amendment signify by saying aye.

979
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Aye.

980
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Opposed nay.

981
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.500
The ayes have it and it will be included.

982
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:43.500
Commissioner, that was all, I believe.

983
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.500
Thank you.

984
01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:54.500
Can I ask one thing that just came to me about the bridge reallocation that we did earlier?

985
01:56:54.500 --> 01:57:10.000
This means that towns that happen to be in the time window to take advantage of the federal funds would be excused from their local match requirement under state aid bridge.

986
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000
So in some sense, it's a matter of timing that they're getting that windfall.

987
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Yes, we've had to go through and look carefully at how far projects were in the design to make sure that we could convert them to federal funds.

988
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.500
In the federal program, you can't expend dollars until you have federal approvals.

989
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:47.500
So there were some projects that were too far along that we couldn't federalize them even though they were eligible.

990
01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:58.500
And so this really reflects which projects based on both eligibility and the phase of design could be incorporated to the program.

991
01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.500
All right.

992
01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:06.000
Just so everybody is aware of what we have agreed to.

993
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:25.500
Last time we were here in our work session, we agreed to changes to two projects on the FE Everett Turnpike, an ownership transfer of Continental Boulevard and the location of the main line toll and plaza in Bedford.

994
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:34.000
Today we have adopted for inclusion into the committee amendment, the amendments to RSA 237-2 and 237-7.

995
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:45.500
We have also adopted to include in the committee amendment all of the information on municipal bridge projects and how they'll be funded.

996
01:58:45.500 --> 01:59:01.500
We have also included funding for a project in Hudson for a feasibility study and a proposal for the department to provide some information on an annual basis about traffic on St.

997
01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.500
Road 153.

998
01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:06.000
That is what I have.

999
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:18.000
That is what will go to legislative services for incorporation into a committee amendment, which we will not stick around today to vote on.

1000
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.000
We have a continued executive session on this.

1001
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:31.500
It will take legislative services a bit of time to put this all together and make sure it's right.

1002
01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.500
We will vote on that on the 24th of February.

1003
01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:39.500
Representative McConkie, you had a quick...

1004
01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:41.500
Thank you, Mr.

1005
01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.500
Chairman.

1006
01:59:43.500 --> 02:00:16.500
A general question for the commissioner, if if i could um i've been haunted ever since you spoke and said you had difficulty getting out of your driveway with a snowstorm i i uh my sons can't believe the commissioner couldn't do that so planning but my question is uh yeah spring spring always sneaks up on me and what happens with our roads and potholes.

1007
02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:22.500
Last week, up north, 16 and other roads just started peeling away.

1008
02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:29.000
And you've probably already addressed this in a previous conversation with the committee.

1009
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:40.500
Are our funds on track with those annual repairs that we have to do to get those roads back in place, stitched together?

1010
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:45.000
So we really have five seasons in New Hampshire.

1011
02:00:45.000 --> 02:02:03.000
We have the four official seasons and then pothole season, depending how uh the free style cycle goes throughout the winter months um so yes you know our maintenance forces will be out uh patching potholes and trying to hold things together until the summer construction season um as usual we'll have our district resurfacing program that will make improvements and then we have a certain amount of betterment funding that we make available for the districts to do greater shim and paver shim on roadways that aren't scheduled for paving that year but we have some concerns around you know how that road's going to hold out through another winter season until we do an assessment sort of the end of the winter it's hard to project if we have all the funding that we need, but certainly we'll be working to make sure that we address the sections that are in very poor condition.

1012
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Thank you, Commissioner.

1013
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Representative Ebel.

1014
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Thank you.

1015
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Unrelated to Representative McConkie's question, I thought the department was going to give us an aggregate number of the amount of money in tolls that had been lost because of the toll booth removals in Merrimack and also the costs associated with removal of the infrastructure.

1016
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I apologize, Representative.

1017
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
We did pull that information together and we have it with us.

1018
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
We did not pass it out given the nature of today's meeting.

1019
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.500
It's not a work session.

1020
02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:53.000
So thank you for bringing that to our attention.

1021
02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:09.500
I'm going to let Bill Cass walk you through the numbers because he and our Turnpike folks are the ones that have testified each time there was legislation concerning removing the toll plazas.

1022
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:11.500
Thank you.

1023
02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:23.000
I wanted to make sure I presented it because there's a couple of different numbers because we're kind of comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID.

1024
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:30.500
The numbers that I have are presented at the time that the tolls were removed.

1025
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:40.000
So the revenue loss at the removal of exit 12 and 11, which was pre-COVID, was around $1.4 million.

1026
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.500
Exit 10, which was just removed this January 1st, was post-COVID.

1027
02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:49.500
And the revenue from that was around $300,000.

1028
02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:57.500
So a total is $1.7 million in annual revenue because of the elimination of those tolls.

1029
02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:05.500
And I think, Representative Graham, you had asked also about some of the other incidental costs.

1030
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.000
So that's just a loss of revenue.

1031
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:23.500
It's cost around roughly $2 million, $1.9 million for the physical removal of all three of those tolls between $600,000 and $800,000 at each one of those three plazas.

1032
02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:43.000
And then the final removal of the tunnel and the demolition and the removal of the buildings and the excess pavement and reconfiguring the ramps, which will be done under the overall Turnpike Widening Project, is about $4 million.

1033
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:58.500
So you would ask for those three kind of components and revenue loss, what the immediate removal of the tolls were, and then the full remediation of completely removing the infrastructure.

1034
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.500
Thank you.

1035
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.500
Any further questions, comments?

1036
02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.500
Representative?

1037
02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.500
Excuse me?

1038
02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:28.500
I will give a little bit of latitude to since the commissioner is here and seems to be willing to answer some questions which she always is but we have finished with what we are going to be doing today on House Bill 2022.

1039
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:36.500
But if she is willing to entertain one or two brief and cogent questions, go ahead.

1040
02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:38.500
Thank you, Commissioner.

1041
02:05:38.500 --> 02:06:02.500
This is my 10-year gripe of are we making any greater progress on cutbacks on scenic vistas on the interstate highway system that, as you know, when it was designed, was designed for scenic vistas that have all grown in, which also create icing hazards on the highway.

1042
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:25.000
And I had tried to manage a cooperative between what used to be DREAD and you guys, and it all came down to who was going to get the money and where the Fed's going to do it and who was going to get paid.

1043
02:06:25.000 --> 02:07:45.500
Is there anything I can get from you for language, anything that we can do to help to bring back the scenic vistas on the highway system, get cutbacks done and improve icing conditions etc so representative we have made some efforts to cut back within the right-of-way that we own around the scenic vistas of course with covid and our reduced revenues we've had to prioritize our work so we haven't necessarily kept up in the last couple of years the way that we'd hoped the real issue at number of the scenic vistas is that we don't own the land where the trees have grown up it's private property in front of the state right of way and between the view and the roadway and so it really would be an extensive effort to try and partner with those abutters and neighbors to see if they're willing to do some selective clearing on their property to restore the view.

1044
02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:51.000
Especially in the lakes region areas, that's very much the case.

1045
02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:11.000
We own a limited right-of-way and then trees have grown up between the roadway and the lake and so that's what's obstructing the view and we don't have the authority to go in and clear trees on somebody else's property.

1046
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:31.500
So we were willing to partner with DRED at the time, but every location that we went to, we cleared as much as we could, but it was really beyond the state-owned right-of-way where we had the issues blocking the view.

1047
02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:33.500
Anything else?

1048
02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:35.500
Here's Representative Newin.

1049
02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.500
Yes.

1050
02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.500
Thank you, Mr.

1051
02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.500
Chairman.

1052
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:49.000
I hope this qualifies in kind of a catch-all for a question to the Commissioner.

1053
02:08:49.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Yes, Commissioner, probably a couple of years ago anyway, talked about wintertime, our snowplows, and some difficulty in attracting and maintaining your snowplow drivers.

1054
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
It was financial.

1055
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.500
It was a quality of life issue and whatever.

1056
02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.000
How is it this year?

1057
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Thank you.

1058
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:20.000
So like every employer in the state, we are really struggling to recruit and retain talent.

1059
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And our vacancy rate, yes, is higher than it has been in the past.

1060
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:46.000
We are very, very fortunate that we have a number of individuals across the department who have a commercial driver's license, a CDL, and they've been willing to volunteer and supplement our highway maintainers who perform winter maintenance.

1061
02:09:46.000 --> 02:10:22.000
So we have been working very hard to ensure that for every storm we have a person in every truck but we have no real bench anymore and if it wasn't for those volunteers we certainly would have a very different performance but that's what's great about being the commissioner for DOT it's an all hands on deck approach to things and we have individuals who are always willing to step up.

1062
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:31.000
So it's not easy, and certainly if we have a prolonged winter, we do get concerned about burnout.

1063
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.500
We don't have multiple shifts.

1064
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:44.500
These guys work around the clock to keep the roads clear and only take safety breaks when they work for multiple days.

1065
02:10:44.500 --> 02:11:06.500
So we really express our gratitude not only to our DOT employees within highway maintenance, but like I said, those from throughout operations and other bureaus who do their part, as well as the hire trucks, the contractors who work alongside us as well.

1066
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:08.500
On which?

1067
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.500
We're deleting it.

1068
02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.500
I know.

1069
02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:21.500
Commissioner, I was looking at an amendment which we've deleted, but it says construction of a second barrel.

1070
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.500
The term doesn't register with me after all these years.

1071
02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.500
On the Spalding.

1072
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.500
What is a barrel?

1073
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:36.000
So a barrel is basically one half of a divided highway.

1074
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:45.500
So we talk about the northbound and the southbound barrels of the interstate as an example or the Spalding.

1075
02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:47.500
Okay.

1076
02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:49.500
So thank you.

1077
02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:51.500
Okay.

1078
02:11:51.500 --> 02:12:00.000
And one second or so I am going to recess the executive session on House Bill 2022.

1079
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:07.000
We will take it back up again on February 24th with a committee amendment.

1080
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Hopefully, we will have it all.

1081
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Everything that we agreed to will be in it and that we can all support it at that point and finish up.

1082
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And that morning we also have two other bills that we have to held an executive session on and whatever other work may come before the committee at that time.

1083
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Any questions on the work plan?

1084
02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
All right.

1085
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Okay.

1086
02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Now, more of a procedural question.

1087
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.500
This amendment we're working on, when do you think it will be ready?

1088
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:54.500
By the 24th.

1089
02:12:54.500 --> 02:13:15.000
Because the reason I asked this, if it could be emailed in advance, we could look it over and make sure everything's okay and hopefully exec the amendment and the bill within a few minutes when we meet again the 24th.

1090
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:29.000
I will see how long it takes between committee, the other work that they're working on for other committees as well, as well as two days of session.

1091
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
We'll see.

1092
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:44.000
It's a great idea though okay thank you any other comments if not the executive session on House Bill 2022 is in recess until February 24th.

1093
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:53.500
And again, Commissioner, to you and your staff, appreciate the work and the quick turnaround that goes into it.

1094
02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:59.000
And watch out that some of the mics are live, people.

1095
02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Thank you.
