public and to committee members um due
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
to the fact we have concurring things
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
going on between here and other
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
committees uh within the the house and
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate here I have to be out of here
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
in four minutes to testify in a bill
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
upstairs in Commerce uh our Municipal
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
and um what we're going to do is we're
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to take a break and not have any
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
executive action taking place till
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
11:00 and so we'll be caucusing probably
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
around quarter of 11 to 11 o'clock and
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%

the first time I have not yet read them
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%

now and and
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%

take a break and we'll come back at 11
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes uh the we have already
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
passed previously a bill that deals with
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
Athletics um both in the second in the
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
secondary levels this bill also sends it
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
to the to the college Collegiate level
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
which we uh did not uh support uh in
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
when we passed our initial bill and also
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
there are other components of this which
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh have some issue I'm going to let
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
others speak to that uh so that's all I
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to say on this
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
one representative luno uh thank you
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair um yeah we think
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
375 doesn't have any place doesn't have
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
any business in um in New Hampshire and
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
um and discri discriminates um not only
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
against a a protected um uh
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
classification but uh but but but really
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
um um you know also
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
violates not only you know aspects of
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
Title 9 uh but fair play and frankly
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
what we heard from almost 40 people
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday that hey these kids just want
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
to play and be part of the team so thank
 
01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.350 align:start position:0%
to play and be part of the team so thank
you

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments from the rest of
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
the committee Bel and yes representative
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair I'll just
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
speak quickly because I I will be
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the is motion uh my logic is
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
slightly different I don't mind the idea
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
of telling colleges and universities
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
what we need to be doing on this but my
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
hangup here is that in this bill there
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
is an exception that allows um young
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
women to participate on boys teams um I
 
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
believe that's somewhat inconsistent
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
with the uh the goal of preventing
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
injury despite the fact that the women
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
are making the decision to we're talking
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
about young girls who were not adults
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
who do not have a full measure of agency
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a decision they
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
should be making and I also think boy
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
Sports deserve to be protected because I
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
think any well brought up young man who
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
is conscientious probably would not go
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
100% against a female as I probably
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
would not have um and I think they
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
deserve that opportunity as well thank
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
you you any other
 
01:35:26.189 --> 01:35:26.199 align:start position:0%

01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
I'll second
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%

01:37:39.239 --> 01:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
second any um comments from the maker of
the

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes I do have comments I think
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the issue of putting AED units in uh
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools is very very
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
important and I support this 110%
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh external defibrillators are are
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
needed um uh what we want to do though
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
is we we have to be careful how we walk
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
around this in terms of funded vers
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates uh however uh having
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
been involved with Athletics and sports
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
my entire life and my family definitely
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
all of them are in either division one
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
or division three Athletics I have seen
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
injuries on the field where this would
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
have been a needed item and not just for
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
those that are athletes though but it's
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
also important that we have it there
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
available for people that are my age
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
that are going to be 79 here in another
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
few months and um cardiac issues are
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
very common amongst grandparents and
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
parents and young children even so I
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
think that this is a a a a safety issue
 
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
a health issue and it's just playing
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
good policy so I do support the issue of
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
AED uh units in schools I'm a little
 
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
concerned though uh I don't want to walk
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
too much on the turf of mandating
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
something that's unfunded at this time
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
so but I do like this bill as it's
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
written I think that tries to scoot
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
around that issue so with that Madam
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
chair I'm you know please to ask for
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.629 align:start position:0%

that was great representative uh Mr
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
chair um bottomline saving lives I think
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
with having Piper Moran here as a living
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
example of why it's important and uh at
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
all all all age levels um yeah so I'm
 
01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.910 align:start position:0%
all all all age levels um yeah so I'm
all

01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%

with Amendment
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
15968 and the reason is because as we
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
got into the discussion on this we were
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
concerned not so much
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
um initially we weren't concerned about
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
it being an unfunded mandate because it
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
says if the school but the problem comes
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
in it's a safety issue the problem comes
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
in if the school has one AED
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it's supposed to be within 3
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
minutes the sports team is going to take
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
the AED from its recognized place where
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
it is in the school where the emergency
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel know where it is where
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the school knows what
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
it is and have to take it out to the
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
field now if there's an emergency in the
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
school leus excuse me we need a second
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
before you're going to be
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
a there you
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
go um I call in representative Hall were
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
you second this amendment not the
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
amendment not the amendment okay okay so
 
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
the issue is then if there's an
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
emergency in the school or someplace
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
else like at a different field whatever
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
people are going to go where they know
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
the AED is but it's not going to be
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
there and so the way to remedy that and
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is where we got into unfunded
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
mandate would be to provide multiple
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
aeds so that they could be where they
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
belonged and we came up with an
 
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to provide M to pay for the
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
state to pay for but it's not a budget
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
year and we were told we couldn't do
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
that and if we just mandated that they
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
did it that was an unfunded mandate and
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
so what we decided was to take the
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
parts that were absolutely essential and
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
didn't add other safety issues passed
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
them this year and put in the proper
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
Bill next year that takes care of those
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and next year is a budget year and it
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost that much and if the state
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
just paid for aeds for all this you know
 
01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.350 align:start position:0%
just paid for aeds for all this you know
to

01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
each each um District but I also noticed
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
that one kid leaving for an EFA that
 
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
District gets enough money
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
extra have following it to pay for all
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
the aeds but just to give an idea of how
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
little that is so the state could just
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
pay for them but we can't put that in
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
this year next year's a budget year put
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
that in next year put the parts in that
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't cause additional harm additional
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
safety issues put those in because for
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
instance making sure it's in a well
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
marked and safe place so everybody knows
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
where it is and it's not locked in an
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
office when the nurse goes home because
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are in nurses offices and
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
they go home and the sports teams are
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
still there and now nobody can get at it
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
so those we felt were critical enough to
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
make sure they stayed and to take the 3
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
minutes out until we can make sure
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's a way that it is 3 minutes away
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
from every Sports field some of which
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
are a good 15 or more
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
minutes you have big schools have sports
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
teams all over the place there's no way
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
you can satisfy this the way it's
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
written so that was the point of
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
the is try to get as much safety in
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
without making things unsafe that's it
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
representative

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you um why does the
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
amendment REM remove the requirement for
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
an individual trained in CPR to be at
 
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.510 align:start position:0%
an individual trained in CPR to be at
sports

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
activities um it doesn't say be at them
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
it says supervise and when I tried to
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
figure out what that meant supervise
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
organized sports
 
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
activities um I didn't get any kind of
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable answer is that a person who
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
supervises all of them is a person who
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
attends each
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
one I don't know they didn't they didn't
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
have then they were talking about
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
supervisor as in one sports person who
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
ran around with an AED between all the
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
things schools don't necessarily have
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
that especially small schools and it's a
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
good idea for schools to certify as many
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
people as possible but we don't have to
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
make it but this way of writing it in
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
the law didn't make it clear or make
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
sense personally I think a whole lot of
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
people at the school should be certified
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
in CPR and I think every sports team
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
should have at least one person in
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
attendance doesn't have to be
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
supervising just in attendance but
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's like I said that's part of the
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
proper bill that needs to be written to
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
get that right thank you very much
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative dry thank you I think I
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
can answer your question there's a
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
reason that aeds can be left in lobbies
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
of hotels and supermarkets it's because
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
you turn it on and you do what it says
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be easy to use 911 can
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
talk anyone through uh use of an AED and
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
CPR um this bill also the the statute
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
already has a school identifying the
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
Personnel trained in the use of the aeds
 
01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
so that's already that's already there
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
who could be done but I'm going to just
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
say that there's a move across the state
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that staff and even
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
students who are of appropriate age like
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
about e8th grade or so are trained in
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
our area everybody the staff of all the
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
schools and um all the eighth graders
 
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
know how to use an AED and do CPR so I
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
think that the the general public is out
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
there it's enough and it's General
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
enough and easy enough to use that this
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
is okay um and the school has already
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
got a list of who's personally trained
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
if they feel like they need somebody
 
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
they've got a list to draw
 
01:45:48.189 --> 01:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
from thank you um representative
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
Heath thank you madam chair just a quick
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
question this does not in any way alter
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
the need for the plan am I
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
correct the in in the bill there is a
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
plan for how to carry every no nothing
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
has changed okay thank
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
you representative belch thank you madam
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to offer a real quick
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
summary of where we're at here uh this
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill was brought to us from the Senate
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
um we're generally very supportive of
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
the concept the trouble is the bill was
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
not thoroughly fleshed out when it comes
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the nuances and risks that are
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
associated with this as well as the
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
financial component of it this would
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
either there was two ways to look at
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
this either we create an unfunded
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
mandate which would be unconstitutional
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
or we properly fund this trouble is we
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time to do that right
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
now because our deadline is here so we
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
want to do what we can in this that is
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
actually not creating any constitutional
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
problems and return to flesh out the
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
rest of this as it should be to actually
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
do something next year with this thank
 
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.030 align:start position:0%
do something next year with this thank

representative Hall any further
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah I just make a quick note
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
that I think as was asked by represent
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
Damon training is absolutely NE
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh that's that's addressed
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill but I also think what
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative dry said is absolutely
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
correct you can turn the button on and
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
then you got it talking to you that's
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably more pertinent than uh the
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
other but um I the the the aeds we need
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%

Bel want to speak to your yes thank you
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um in the in the original bill
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
I had I had one concern of some
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
magnitude when it came to the uh
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
standard that was being used as far as
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the good faith Judgment of a
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
credential person because that is a
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
atypical um judicial standard
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
for any sort of adjudication um I don't
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
know how that would be adjudicated it
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
would be very complicated I imagine so I
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
I would insert instead the very common
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh judicial standard of the reasonable
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
person standard uh just a very minor
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
change that I think brings this more in
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
line with
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
precedent thank you further discussion
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
from the second no further discussion
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
from the floor or from the committee
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
not seeing
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%

very much um you know honestly there's
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing any Amendment uh
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
certainly not this amendment can do to
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%

01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
be very brief uh simple concept of the
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
bill would require um those Educators to
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
answer you know truthfully and honestly
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
to inquiries by parents and Guardians
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
regarding their children um I will
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
address one objection that was raised
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that truthful and honesty is uh
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
is a two- weighty standard that would
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
require them to say things that they may
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
not know so they have to take notes
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
constantly about what each child is
 
01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
doing absolutely not absolutely not all
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
it would require is the truth and
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
honesty to the best of their knowledge
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
there is no new standard being
 
01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
introduced in this bill that would
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
require constant observation and
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
notetaking it's just to the best of your
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge answer answer truthfully and
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
honesty about about about a child to
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
their parent thank you further
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
discussion represent McDonald thank you
 
01:56:15.199 --> 01:56:16.030 align:start position:0%
discussion represent McDonald thank you
Mr

01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
chair as stated by the pre Prime sponsor
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill yesterday this legislation
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
only addresses education process and it
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
as amended ensures student safety
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
moreover the bill recognizes the role of
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
Educators as mandatory reporters and the
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of parents to guide
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
the upbringing of their minor children
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
in addition because of the concerns that
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
were addressed yesterday I'd like to
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
underscore that nothing within this bill
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
even mentions any particular Community
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
never mind targets any particular
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
community and for that reason I believe
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
there's been a substantial
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding during yesterday's disc
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
discussion however with respect to New
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lgbtq plus students this
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill ensures that more adults are aware
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
so they can be compassionate with
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
much-needed love and support and New
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is fortunate to be home to
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
both excellent teachers and excellent
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
parents and a number of individuals from
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
both groups were present yesterday and
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's Paramount that members of both
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
groups collaborate to ensure that the
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
best possible opportunities for all
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
students including transgender students
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
and finally having difficult discussions
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
Fosters greater understanding which can
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
only occur with a commitment to honesty
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
and to integrity and for these reasons I
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
support the Bill thank you thank you
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%

committee can't seem to bring itself to
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
to listen to and respond to the
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
overwhelming amount of testimony
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%

cisgendered athletes when it comes to
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
looking at um at at this at this uh bill
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
here and you know at the at the end of
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
the day what what what keeps coming back
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
to me is something that I read in a um
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
in know in a report
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
um in in the in the conquered local
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
newspaper um with respect to a related
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
Bill not 341 but uh but a related Bill
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
and um and it was by a mom who writes
 
02:00:35.709 --> 02:00:35.719 align:start position:0%
quote it doesn't matter what anybody
 
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't matter what the
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
statistics say or what the professionals
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
say end quote they have the quote begins
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
again they have their opinion and they
 
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
aren't going to change it no matter what
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
anybody says and I don't think that's
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
what what we're I don't think that's
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
what our voters put here put us here for
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think our I think Granite Staters
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
hardworking Granite Staters put us here
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
to listen to
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
them and we're not doing that and I hope
 
02:01:08.589 --> 02:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
as we do move towards a vote on this
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
that people will consider you know
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
nobody's got a mandate on this issue
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
this isn't an ideological mandate um but
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
we pretty we heard clearly from our
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%

02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%

lie and therefore that is why it should

be
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%

meetings with parents with other
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
teachers not once can I say that I heard
 
02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:49.000 align:start position:0%

contact with a lot of girls and I made
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
it very clear to the girls that yeah we
 
02:03:21.069 --> 02:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
were going to be talking about a lot of
 
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive issues especially as they were
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
getting older once they started Cadets
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
we sat down and really had a
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
conversation and we made it clear to
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
them that we would not lie to their
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
parents and if they told us things that
 
02:03:38.669 --> 02:03:38.679 align:start position:0%
we felt were very harmful to them we
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
would tell the parents you know
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
what those girls confided all kinds of
 
02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
information to us they talked to us
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of things they didn't
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable talking to their
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
parents St out they called me mom and
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
all the the parents were fine with that
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
cuz they were happy to have that one
 
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
trusted adult that was me for a lot of
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
years so much so that when a daughter
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
was definitely clearly going through
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
something that she didn't feel
 
02:04:11.709 --> 02:04:11.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable talking to her mom her mom
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
called me and said can you go camping
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
with my daughter and a friend up at my
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
dad's hunting lodge so my daughter can
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
talk to you
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
and we had and it was very personal
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
stuff she was going with and the thing
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
is they trusted me to do that because
 
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
they knew I would not lie to them and
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
the kids knew what the boundaries were
 
02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
and knew that I would not lie and yet
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
they still felt very comfortable talking
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
to me and I don't think we should be
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
telling teachers that they're to lie to
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
students I think that breaks the trust
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
from both I mean lies to parents which
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
at least one school district actually
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
has on its
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
website and um I think it's very harmful
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
and I think it's also teaching children
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
that lying is okay because if oh yeah
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell the truth except with
 
02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
for this then this it's okay to lie in
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
this case but not in that case I was
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
very clear I was not going to lie and I
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
think it was very important and I think
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
I was able to have those conversations
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
with those kids that otherwise they
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to have an
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
adult to talk to If I had
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
not firmly stood by I will not lie and
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
if there is something that I think is
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
really harmful to you I will pass it on
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
to your parents further discussion
 
02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
to your parents further discussion
representative

02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
chair this is clearly a very emotional
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
and concerning proposed piece of
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
legislation no matter which perspective
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
I am so impressed by the
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
Courage The
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
Voice the experience of the people who
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
have testified both in person and I have
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
had a lot of constituent messages and
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
conversations there are about
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
90% in opposition to the bill and 10% in
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
favor and all of those people equally
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
believe believe that they are choosing
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
the right thing for
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
children I will be voting to oppose this
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
bill because I think that when you
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
violate or persecute one group it is
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
just a beginning of what follows from
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
there and I will Echo the wonderful man
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
who spoke yesterday on both this bill
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
and 375 one of the many wonderful
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
speakers I'm sorry I can't quote his
 
02:06:49.239 --> 02:06:50.149 align:start position:0%
speakers I'm sorry I can't quote his
name

02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
accurately he said he was 76 years old
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
and he had been homophobic until his
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
daughter came out to him when he was
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
44 and I spoke with him during the break
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
to learn a little more about his
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
experience and he said his whole family
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
knew that his daughter was gay and
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
protected her and him from knowing
 
02:07:16.549 --> 02:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
because they felt his reaction would be
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
harmful to her and eventually she got to
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
the place where she said to him dad I
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
want you to love me for who I am not for
 
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
who you think I am and he spent several
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
years in therapy and now he is an
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for the rights of all people
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
and he was also the gentleman who at the
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
end of his remarks said and I am a
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
Vietnam veteran and I fought for
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
everyone's freedoms that's what we need
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
to do in opposing this bill this is for
 
02:07:44.719 --> 02:07:46.830 align:start position:0%
to do in opposing this bill this is for
everyone's

02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
everyone's
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
freedoms further discussion from
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
committee members representative Cornell
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just think this is a very
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
vague Bill and will be difficult to
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforce in fact if anything is you know
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
determined um that when a parent writes
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
to a credentialed not a non-credentialed
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
employee but just credentialed so um
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
what would determine complete and honest
 
02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
and so I went back and I I read the
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Senate hearing and
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton from the Department of
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
Education said that the complete and
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
honest standard was unclear seemed
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
subjective and would be difficult to
 
02:08:37.629 --> 02:08:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
she the termination was beyond the
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
purview um it would fall outside the
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
Education it's just I don't know if you
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
have to report something to dcyf rather
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
than answer the parent but you have to
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
answer the parent within 10 days but it
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes DCF longer than 10 days
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
to investigate something plus they don't
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
investigate if it's only risk they only
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
investigate if it's something that's
 
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
actually happened so I think this is
 
02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
just something that's just going to
 
02:09:11.229 --> 02:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of problems just even trying
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
to figure out what you're supposed to do
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I I am not in favor of this thank you
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bon thank you Mr chair um
 
02:09:23.069 --> 02:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against this one and um
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
it goes contrary to a program that we
 
02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
have in the Department of Education and
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that it's called one
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
trusted adult and we should be
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging students um especially when
 
02:09:37.549 --> 02:09:37.559 align:start position:0%
they are experiencing some kind of event
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
in their life and they might not feel
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable talking to their parents
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
about it for whatever reason according
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
to the one trusted adult program it says
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
to the children what you say in here
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
stays in here unless someone is hurting
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
you you want to hurt someone you want to
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
hurt yourself or you give permission to
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
share with another trusted adult so I
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you can have this
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
program and support this legislation
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:10:16.669 --> 02:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and I'll just
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
respond to some of some of the
 
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
criticisms I've heard because I've heard
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
so far that
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
it's not happening and I've also heard
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
that it's good that it's happening and I
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't think continuing to
 
02:10:29.709 --> 02:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
Gaslight the public on this issue is
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
going to keep working for people we know
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
that it's happening this didn't come out
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
of thin air I can cite one specific
 
02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
policy that proliferated in New
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
jbab that explicitly requires either
 
02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
dishonesty or Silence of Educators when
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents asked them about certain things
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
about their own children this was in my
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
own School District until it was very
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
recently repealed
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
thankfully um so this this didn't come
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
out of thin air it's a real phenomena
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's too bad that we have to have this
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
conversation and put this kind of thing
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
in law now but I never would have
 
02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
thought we would had to but we do we
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
have to protect uh the the lawful right
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
of parents to direct the upbringing of
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
their children and as far as this idea
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
that there is some sort of
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
confidentiality enshrined in law between
 
02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
a child a teacher that's utter nonsense
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
utterly nonsense even when it comes to
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
the health care providers of minors
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
there is not a confidentiality when
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
parents are involved because they're the
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
parents Children Are Not Mere creatures
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the state children belong to their
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
families their parents there is not a
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
presumption of guilt on these parents
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
until proven otherwise there is a
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence they are
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
innocent unless we can prove that they
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
have committed a crime only then can
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
they be stripped of their parental
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
rights thank you thank you very much is
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
there any for yes representative Tanner
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'd just like to say ditto
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
to uh what a lot of my colleagues have
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
have said today particularly that um
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
this is insulting to teachers um and
 
02:12:10.109 --> 02:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
that there is the um policy that uh
 
02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
representative belter mentioned uh he
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
had a little difficulty finding it uh
 
02:12:16.549 --> 02:12:16.559 align:start position:0%
when I asked him about it because it has
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
been rescinded at this particular time
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's no longer in effect um um I would
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
say that in my 35 years of teaching and
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
coaching and I think um several people
 
02:12:31.549 --> 02:12:31.559 align:start position:0%
that I heard on Zoom yesterday talk
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
about their experiences that students
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
just and also representative leus that
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
students do come to you and ask for you
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
know as a way to talk things out a way
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
to to um deal with some issues they find
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
very difficult and as you talk to them
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
um you're talking to them about you know
 
02:12:56.549 --> 02:12:56.559 align:start position:0%
speaking to their parents which a lot of
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
people uh talked about yesterday too
 
02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that it was the initial contact and
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
that um they talked the the student
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
through it um silence sometimes is the
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
best thing to say like if someone says
 
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
the this make me look fat um most guys
 
02:13:16.549 --> 02:13:16.559 align:start position:0%
will say silence is the is the better
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary thing to to uh do and I
 
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
think that it points out that nothing in
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
life is black and white like this law
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
makes it um there's a lot of discretion
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
in how you handle different things a lot
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
of discretion in how um you approach
 
02:13:37.229 --> 02:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
things with with parents with other
 
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
students with um uh anybody who is
 
02:13:43.709 --> 02:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
coming to you and revealing something
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
that you know they would not like
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the world to know
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
about so um I think that this Bill uh
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
has a lot more bad unintended or
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
intended consequences to it as far as
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
how it's going to affect teacher student
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
relationships credential teachers only
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
and um it's going to you know it it's it
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
one size doesn't fit all you just don't
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
do yes or no lie or you're not lying um
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
you know it the it just fails to look at
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
the innuendos of human
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
interaction social interaction and
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
common decency so in those Reasons I'm
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be voting for this Bill
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee represent
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
to clarify that the policy that
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative belter brought up
 
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
jbab is a withdrawn sample transgender
 
02:14:49.629 --> 02:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
policy um it was drawn withdrawn two
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
years ago because of misinterpretation
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
the policy was
 
02:14:58.830 --> 02:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
intended to say that schools could not
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
tell uh a student status to other
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents not that student's parents but
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
that they could not tell it to other
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
parents we live in small communities
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
where travels the policy was determined
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
to be um confusing or or easily
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted it was withdrawn it
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%

02:18:32.669 --> 02:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
version of this amendment 1593 and it's
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
just word yeah we want to just talk
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
about that so that we can sure we we we
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
it okay 1593 is the bill which we're
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:18:57.790 --> 02:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
folks 2 excuse 217 excuse me 217
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
159 1593 is the old amendment I should
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
misspoke on that uh which we're trying
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
to get changed if you're looking at 1593
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
H right now it' be down on line
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
11 where there are several words which
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
are taken out where it says employed as
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
an instructional or pupil and uh I
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
scratched mine out pretty I did that
 
02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
service employe pupil Service employee
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
so or pupil service has been scratched
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
out and it simply says employed as an
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
instructional employee anybody that's in
 
02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
there working with kids is in
 
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
instructing so it doesn't say anything
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
about certified so it be instructional
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
employee credential is on the line 10
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
already so that's that's the the minor
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
it represent Damon so what is the
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
meaning of a people's Service employee I
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
why it would it would have to be a
 
02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
why it would it would have to be a
credentialed

02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
credentialed
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
individual as on the line above you do
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
have certain Paras that have
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
credentials and so that it that
 
02:20:29.230 --> 02:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
individual would also come up but they
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
also are inst structional
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
nature does it what about like uh
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
language Pathologists or um School
 
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
psychologists or guidance counselors or
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
I I consider them all part of
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
instruction you know they I used to have
 
02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
a psychologist in school and that
 
02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
psychologist had kids in his office for
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
teaching them and working with them uh
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
and and and the same thing with the
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
physical therapists or the speech
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
pathologists often times well that is
 
02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
instruction uh they're in there meshing
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
up often times speech therapist is using
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
the same material that the teacher in
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the classroom may use to help with
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
certain sounds
 
02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
articulation they are credential they
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
are credential employees
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
in fact to get certification as a speech
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
pathologist you have to have your
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
Masters plus your C's which is a very
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
difficult Ash a test but are I mean
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
usually when we've been using the word
 
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
credentialed we've been uh referencing
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
credentialing uh for
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
instruction and so I'm wondering if if
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating a lot of people by
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
know Bel I I don't believe we are but
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr chair I
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know I have
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
received the amendment I've just
 
02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
forwarded it the HCS for printing uh we
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
should have it momentarily I'll go get
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
it um but just a comment on what yep it
 
02:22:04.399 --> 02:22:09.150 align:start position:0%
it um but just a comment on what yep it
is

02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
16028 y um so what this does obviously
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
just take a quick look it we've we've
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
changed the program to a grant program
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
we want to make it available to all
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
teachers who might be able to receive
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
this based on retention including those
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
who may not have outstanding student
 
02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
loans and uh we wanted to really make
 
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
clear that this program is is Ed is
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
aimed at Educators credential Educators
 
02:22:34.990 --> 02:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
who were there teaching students uh and
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
I think anyone that we would want to
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
actually do that with to retain them the
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
people we have a shortage of would
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
reasonably fall under the instructional
 
02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
reasonably fall under the instructional
employee

02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:47.670 align:start position:0%
employee
um

02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
phraseology uh I I don't think it
 
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually hurts anything to remove people
 
02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
actually hurts anything to remove people
Service

02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
employee so is your intent is your
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
intent to cover people who are um doing
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
like Speech Pathology and physical
 
02:23:07.389 --> 02:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
therapy and even if it's
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
not even if they're not having
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty retaining people it just
 
02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
because I mean this seems to be focused
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
on Rural
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
schools um and it is all credential
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
teachers but I'm just I'm I'm wondering
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you know because finding some of
 
02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
these other people are very difficult
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
but there may be one locally that you
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
know has been there forever um or is
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
moving to a new district and and is
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
available but not necessarily in a
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
shortage area so what's your intent
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so my intent
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
in my reading of this would say that if
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
you are a a credential person involved
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
in educating which I I believe that
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
would qualify uh so long as you meet all
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
the other requirements then then yes
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
that would that would be an acceptable
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
use of this however bear in mind that
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
things that I did not amend that are s
 
02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
same from the original part of this bill
 
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
include a number of other qualifications
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um including I believe something about a
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
um identifying a a shortage
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
field um to be a part of this program is
 
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
critical educator shortages I believe is
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
shortages let's have people go to the
 
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:36.750 align:start position:0%
shortages let's have people go to the
chair

02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
please okay so down in section
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
two the department shall identify
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
specific schools that are affected by
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
critical educator shortages using the
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow criteria and it has rural
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
isolation of the school that's the rural
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
schools or economic disadvantage of the
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
school based on eligibility to funds
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
pursuant to Title One Part A of the
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
federal Elementary and secondary
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
Education Act what we're trying to do is
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
say okay those schools who are having
 
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
trouble retaining
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
teachers instructional staff because
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're moving to other schools that
 
02:25:19.389 --> 02:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
have more money or that are in nicer
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
areas or whatever ever that we want to
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
retain them so we're going to give them
 
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
a grant for each year that they stay
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to get a certain amount of
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
money and it's it's a retention Grant
 
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
it's to try to solve the issue that we
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
keep hearing about teachers taking other
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
jobs because they get paid more or
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
because of all these other things so
 
02:25:42.750 --> 02:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
this is to try to
 
02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.269 align:start position:0%
this is to try to
directly

02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
help fulfill those by giving a an award
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's that was the
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
question the question was critical
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
shortage in an area of teaching not a
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
critical shortage in the area of the
 
02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
state a shortage of science teachers a
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
shortage of Math teachers not shortage
 
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
in the North
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
country and I don't think it says a
 
02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
critical shortage in any one area of of
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
so so Mr chair just to just to be clear
 
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we misunderstood representative

belcher's um remarks with respect to
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
critical shortage area but but my
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the um um that the
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
amendment 1593 H nor the amendment
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%

1602 for 2117
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
sb217 made by representative beler and
 
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
second by represent luno do you care to
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion represent belshire
 
02:33:34.349 --> 02:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll keep it brief uh
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
in summary we had a committee uh looking
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
at teacher retention come forward with
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
some recommendations the original bill
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
was in line with that however what we've
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
done is we've changed some some
 
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
significant things in this while keeping
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the bill what we've done
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
is create looking to create a grant
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
program available to teachers in Rural
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
and underserved areas critical shortage
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
areas um in order to help with retention
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
of teachers who are otherwise leaving
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
some of these uh more rural districts uh
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
rather than looking at student loans
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to put that money directly
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
in their pockets I like that because it
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
lets them decide what they want to do
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
with it is whatever the best use is and
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
it makes it available to a larger number
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
of teachers teach and potentially
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
because there may be some who don't have
 
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
student loans and we don't want to be
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against them just because
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have student loans we want to
 
02:34:28.269 --> 02:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
make this available to them because they
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
too are worth retaining thank you
 
02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:34.670 align:start position:0%
too are worth retaining thank you
