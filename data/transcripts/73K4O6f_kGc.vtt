you this may all look somewhat familiar
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
that uh last year we had hp88 that
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
passed but um this section apparently
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
was lost and uh was not brought forth
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
during that uh hp88 and was not
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
discovered until after through the
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
governor so I apologize for having to
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%

okay yes understand I understand uh just
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
to keep our record straight could you
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
identify yourself as a clerk
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
sorry um again I'm okay the mic is on
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
right you can everybody hear me all
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
right I'm state representative John
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
cluder Sullivan County District 10
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
representing the entire city of
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
Claremont and I am I'm a co-sponsor of
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
the bill I am actually have a few more
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
terms than representative o' Hearn and I
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
sort of I know it was a goof on my part
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
too because I I agreed to sponsor the
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill on behalf of the city but I
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
probably should have read it a little
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly and I assume the issue
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
was covered but uh so I didn't catch it
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
and none of the other co-sponsors and it
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
went through I guess I don't know this
 
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.389 align:start position:0%
went through I guess I don't know this
committee

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
and Senate didn't catch it and uh also
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
OLS I'm surprised you know I'm not I
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
think they do a great job don't get me
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
wrong it just and again the governor
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
even you know that I figured they might
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
have raised the issue before signing it
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
but no one caught it it was one of those
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
Goose that just went through the system
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
and I'll take my fair share of the blame
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
but it just reminds me constantly
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
and in my own committee Public Works
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
those things happen I've been around
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
long enough to know it's just those
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
things happen and you just got to do the
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
best you correct it and this bill as
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
filed by representative oarn and the
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
rest of the sponsors just uh you know
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
our intent to correct it and make clear
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
what the intent was that the members of
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the city council could not only appoint
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
but dismiss members of the police
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
commission in the original bill which I
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
believe was House Bill 88 which your
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee approved last last year and
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
put on I believe the consent calendar
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
that was our intent and we go you know
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
we goofed up and uh those things happen
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
but it's an an honest attempt and the C
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
majority of the city council wants this
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
so we are trying to carry out their
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
intent of what they want thank you
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
represent you're welcome the I have a
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
question this made it all the way to the
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I believe I mean I
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
can't remember I believe it was on the
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
cons or consent calendar last year you
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
know what you remember the vote I I
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe it was unanimous I mean
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
represent it was unanimous so and I I
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
think I assume it was this committee uh
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
unanimous and went to and passed and
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
went to the house as I said nobody C
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
caught it you know and I'm not trying to
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
pin the blame because I I have to take
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
my fair share of the blame too being
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
around here but it's just one of those
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
things and it's happened to me before I
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
made goof I've seen other
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives who've been in as long
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
have made goose
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
as far as you know it didn't make it to
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
floor well it was on the I think the
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so I mean could we have
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
could have been scrutinized better I
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
suppose it's possible we just all and
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
I'll take my share we all goofed and
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
this is just a way to to correct that
 
00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
this is just a way to to correct that
goof

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
please calendar on the house
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
specifically that uh the council should
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
have full power to remove any police
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you think there is any
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
requirement for the uh Council to remove
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh you mean at the moment
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative as as as a matter of uh
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
practice um I of course I'm not a me
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
repr heard might be better he's on the
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
city council too and I I want to be
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
careful it's but I think they want the
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
authority to appoint and remove police
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners more for the future there
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think there is any as far as I
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
know any Police Commissioner they are
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with as of today but I
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
can't be sure of that uh but I think
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
they want this power uh and this they
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
they voted to request this of the state
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
representatives from Claremont to file
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to take care of because it's
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
right now state law and uh and basically
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
so we are we members of The Claremont
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
delegation you know the four reps and
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
Senator filed this bill at the request
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
of our city council and filed the
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
previous Bill last year House Bill 88
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
follow up yes uh the reason I asked the
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
question is the title of the the section
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
is removal of Commissioners it doesn't
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
say removal of police Commissioners
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
right and but the the the text in the
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
the section is specific to police
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners which is why I ask do you
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Claremont Town Council actually
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
wants the permission to remove any
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I I I think they if if
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's in their judgment I believe as the
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
text says it's any time for and it's got
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
to be a Just Cause And after due hearing
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
um but I think they want that Authority
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's more for in the future uh more than
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
anything I do I'm not aware of any
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner that they are dissatisfied
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
the moment they if this bill passes and
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
becomes law that they would remove at
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
this time that's my understanding
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
represent something you like to add to
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe he
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
can if you could swing the in your
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
direction thank you Mr chair you can
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
hear me so right
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
now the city manager was you pointing
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
authority to a police commission uh all
 
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
the other committees and commissions
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
that are in the city are are appointed
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
by the council and we can remove a
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
member of any board or
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any other
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the from the uh Comm Mr
 
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
questions from the from the uh Comm Mr
chair

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes um I think this is kind of a general
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
question but does the State of New
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have policies and procedures
 
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have policies and procedures
that

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
governs how a city or in the case of
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
towns uh deal with committees and
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
commissions is there any standard that's
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
set um it would seem to me that if there
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
was a hole in the procedures for
 
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.149 align:start position:0%
was a hole in the procedures for
Claremont

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps other cities have exactly the
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
same issue and I'm just wondering if the
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
state has anything that governs the
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
relationship between City councils and
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you m shair there is rsas that
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
govern uh police commissions and other
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh clamont is is unique
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
it was actually the first police
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
commission uh in the state therefore um
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
you go back to the uh the first uh time
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
amended I I said it's existed way before
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
the rsas we're just a little bit unique
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
to the police commission that ours
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
existed and and has to come to the
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body and there has some has
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
been some discussion talk about
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
incorporating it to others but at the
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
clont like every other community has
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
their un uniqueness and we like just to
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
keep this because we don't do it that
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
often coming for you legisl except for
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%

a constituent uh The Honorable Virginia
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
wiwin who emailed a letter to uh this
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
committee to each and every one and I
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
also have a copy I'll leave for the
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
clerk um she sent her testimony and this
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
is why I've submitted the bill uh she
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
was a house representative several years
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
ago and decided to run for County
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner uh we have three districts
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
in Sullivan County and sullan county is
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
one of the um least populated counties
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the State uh and we have three major
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities cities I guess you'd call
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
them uh Claremont Newport and
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
Charlestown are probably our three major
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
areas um but when we come to election
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
for the County Commissioners uh it's an
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
at large vote everybody in the County
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
votes for the commissioner that comes up
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
in whatever
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
District um and that has several
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
disadvantages um one is that even though
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
um you represent a district and you live
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
in a district you may not be known and
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
and if you're known for example in
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont for some reason um you have
 
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
access to a lot more votes than in your
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
District um another issue is that that
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's fairly expensive to run a
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
campaign uh countywide we we're very
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
rural and so you know you're traveling
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh just in my district it takes me an
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
hour and a half to uh make a trip to
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
each of the polling places on Election
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
Day so you can see that and since I have
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
just the upper part of the county um it
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of effort a lot of time and
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh to run for County
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um it also seems in my mind
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
very illogical that you would set up
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
districts and then not have the person
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
who represents that District be elected
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
exclusively from the people within the
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
district so that that person is a true
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative of the district um so I
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
took the uh bill that came before the uh
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
committee I believe u i don't know a cou
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
last term maybe uh for Carol County um
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
and uh worked with OLS on it and you
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
will see that it's a bill that actually
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
um changes changes the voting to
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
districts but does it in a in a u over a
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
period of time as the Commissioners uh
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
have um different terms terms that
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
expire at different times so it would it
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
would slowly come into as they run for
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
their new election I also think it's a
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
great time to do it because because
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
we're redistricting everybody so it's
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
kind of um the electorate will be kind
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
of confused I think this first uh
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
election just by you know everybody's
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to be in a different District or a
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot of districts are going to change so
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's kind of U my little Spiel for
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
today and I'm open to any questions
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you representative
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
has any thought been given to changing
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
the term of the uh no the terms are the
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
same it's just that they um expire it
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're staggered so they expire at
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
different times so this bill is written
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
to um you know to the to the staggered
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
elections of those people thank you any
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
on line nine of the bill it says of the
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so chosen one shall you
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
serve a four-year term and one she'll
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
serve a two-year
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
term how do you determine which one of
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners or the the people
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
running for the uh
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh the office of uh commissioner will be
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
the four-year term and which will be the
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
two-year term these are these are the
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
staggered terms that they have now so
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's to um it speaks to them with
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
their staggered terms coming into that
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
in other words one term one term will
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
expire now which will go four years
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
another term will expire in two years
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
and and that person will get elected so
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
it it nears their staggered their
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
already staggered um
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
terms so uh representative so it might
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
ass assume that after a few years
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
everybody's on a twoe everybody's on yes
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
everybody is then back on on schedule
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes any more
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions yes I have a followup but it
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
really doesn't your answer really
 
00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.230 align:start position:0%
really doesn't your answer really
doesn't

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't
explain

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
how of the two Commissioners that are
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
up how the one will be chosen for a
 
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.390 align:start position:0%
up how the one will be chosen for a
two-year

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
term there's there's three Commissioners
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
in suin County that have staggered
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
elections okay and so one of
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
them will um come in as of this year one
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
of them will be midway through his his
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
or her
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
term oh all right that explains it thank
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
you that
make

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative this
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
is really a nitpicky kind of editorial
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
question and and it has to do with the
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
the choice of the words Chosen and
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
qualified uh
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
and as the bill is talking about
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
election I wonder why you chose you
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
chose the word chosen instead of elected
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
I I didn't choose it that's part of the
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
issue it I don't know if it's language
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
that um mir's language and statutes uh
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
OS um that would be something that ol
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
would have to speak to I think or I
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
would have to ask them I'm not sure why
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's like that I you know I assumed it
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
was um the language that we see
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes in statutes that that come
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
from way way way back so right I I guess
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
it would be clearer to me if it were
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
consistently worded throughout that you
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
know these these folks are elected not
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
chosen okay which is quite a different
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
thing and and also the use of the word
 
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.349 align:start position:0%
thing and and also the use of the word
qu

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
qu
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
qualified um I W wonder if that might be
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
confusing I think the qualified speaks
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the fact that they are resident of
 
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.589 align:start position:0%
to the fact that they are resident of
the

00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
district so it doesn't it doesn't mean
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
that one they're seated their
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
qualification doesn't mean once they're
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
seated it means something different well
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
I think uh qualified for if you run for
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
office to qualify there's C there's a
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
statute around that and since this bill
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
is dealing with uh districts and up to
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
this point you had to be from the
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
district but you were elected at large
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
by the county um I think it just speaks
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
to to being qualified as being still
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
from that District I see thank you very
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and welcome
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
Happy New Year uh
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not clear but I'm pretty sure I
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
you've already answered the question is
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
it my understanding that this results
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
the current system you have now results
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
in a representative from each district
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
so there isn't any District that doesn't
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
have a representative as far
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
as where they live right so you're not
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
trying to do that you're just saying
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
that it's in cumbersome to run
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
the whole uh County when you're only
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
representing a third of the county is
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
that that correct so would be it's an
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency thing as much as anything
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
right so for example mine is a floal
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
obviously with as many the eight towns
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
that I have um if I were a commissioner
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
I might represent those eight towns but
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
everybody in Sullivan County would vote
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
have to have to vote for me um and all
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
these towns that I represent except
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
Newport and even newport's probably one
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
of the smaller town smaller definitely
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
smaller than Claremont um so if if I
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
were to run at large and somebody who
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
lived near the border of Claremont who
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
worked in Claremont and um had a lot of
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
connections with Claremont obviously has
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
a decided advantage over anybody that
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
lives in these other towns um so you
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
know I I think um suvin is only one of
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
three counties that that still does this
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
and I think when New Hampshire was
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
formed and it was all very rural and it
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
was very spread out um it you know
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
probably this system worked where you
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
had an at large voting for any
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner regardless of what district
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're in but now we're at a point um
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
in population and size that it needs to
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
be changed and it needs to be changed so
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
that if you're in District One and you
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
represent for example the eight towns
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
represent um not only am I from those
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
Town one of those towns but that the
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
constituents in those towns the voters
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
in those towns are the people that elect
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
me not the people in Langdon or aworth
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
or Claremont or Charlestown so um that's
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
what the whole reason for this is uh we
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
don't do it any other way you know we
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't do it with state representatives
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
we don't do it with state senators we
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't even do it with like Selectmen and
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
school boards that you know you run for
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in Newport and Claremont gets
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
to vote on it um so I I think that's
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense and uh like I said I
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a way to stagger it in so
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
that uh you know everybody that's
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
present commissioner gets to fill out
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
their term and then as the election goes
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
yes I'm wondering if there's a map
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
available showing um showing the
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
boundaries of these districts well it's
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's just been
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
redistricted uh we've just gone through
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
redistricting so I'm sure there's a new
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
map somewhere of U of of the county um
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners districts uh I don't have
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
it right handy with me today but I'm
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure it's online could you have it sent
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
John um I I only was in contact with one
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
um and he said that uh as far as he was
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
concerned it it really didn't make a
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
difference to him he thought it would
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
save him a lot of money running um the
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
John cluder who was here before uh said
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
he got in contact with one of the other
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who responded the same way
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
that uh he was uh thought it would be
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
more efficient and thought it would be a
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
lot less money from him that he would
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
have to raise in
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
campaign any other comments
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you uh Mr chairman um I
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
just have I think maybe one or possibly
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
two question the um
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
currently it's one person
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
in the district do they live in that
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
District currently um for example I live
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
in sunap so I ran in that I was able to
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
run in that District uh the
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are basically the same
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
thing it's dividing the county up into
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
three district and you must live in in
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
that particular District in order to run
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
but when you run and and they're terms
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
are staggered but when you run uh you
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
the whole county has to vote on you
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh so you're you're running at large
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
through the whole County a follow just
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
one quick hit so just to clarify that
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
means that no commissioner that's in
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
office now could be um pushed out based
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
on this decision right right no the only
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
thing that would push them out is if the
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting push them
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
out any other questions from the
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
committee oh I'm sorry yes
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
just curious if you know of any
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
problems uh um in the current with the
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
current system and by problems I mean
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
not what this might solve but have there
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
been any issues uh in the past that you
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
know about uh where the where you can
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
cite a
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
problem I would say uh there there isn't
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily a problem um I've looked at
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's uh elections for the
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
past few
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
terms and it and it seems like they're
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
in a um they're from an area that's
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
fairly close to this Claremont
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
Charlestown Newport triangle um that
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
even though the dist even though they're
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
in their own Districts The District
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
wherever that District comes close to
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
the the other ones in that particular
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
trajectory that's where they seem to get
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
elected and that's been the experience
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
of um a couple of people who've run from
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
you know from Outer Ling areas so um I
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
think that's another thing just and it
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it may be coincidence you know but
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
it seems like when you vote at large
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
like that that that tend tends to happen
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that seven other
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
counties in the state run their
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
elections by District um and there's
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
only three that that um don't uh
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
Sullivan's one of them and the three are
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
rural counties uh I think that's that
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
speaks to the fact that voting by
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
district and electing by District Works
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
counties you're welcome any other
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative thank

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners who are opposed to
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
this bill they are very happy with the
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
current system they believe that it is
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
important that every member of the
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
county because Sullivan County is a
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
small County gets to vote on the County
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners decisions at the county
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
level as you all know are not made by a
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
district position they are made
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
countywide therefore the Commissioners
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
would ask that you oppose this bill um
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
because they are a small community and
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
feel that every voter should have a say
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
in who is elected to their County
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and I happy to take any
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have this morning
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.309 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for taking my
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
question um what if if you believe that
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners representing a
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
district can be elected by anyone in
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
that county what's the purpose of having
 
00:51:49.799 --> 00:51:50.670 align:start position:0%
that county what's the purpose of having
a

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
district um across the county from a
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
of town cities so that way
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
representation is given from across the
 
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.990 align:start position:0%
representation is given from across the
county

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative okay follow up Mr
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so if if the purpose
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the district is to provide
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
representation why would you be opposed
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
to voters in that District rep voting
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
for their representative why have other

people outside the district vote for
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
that representative uh the S count
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners believe that it is
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
a fair system for everyone in the county
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
to vote for their Commissioners so that
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh because decisions are made at a
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%

you for taking my
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
question I guess my question is a
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
followup to the previous question which
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
is if you believe that the current
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
system is
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
fair then I infer that you believe the
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
syst in being used by Seven Counties is
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
currently unfair why are you not then
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
advocating for a change in the way
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%

there are 10 and we like to joke that
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
there are 10 different ways to do
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything the Sullivan
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners believe that this
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
current system that they have is what
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%

some time as much as possible but I'm
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
briefly uh if uh of the mind if it ain't

broke don't fix it um this has been a
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
longstanding tradition the way we've
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
done it in Sullivan County we've got a
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
good Sullivan County Commissioners team
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you Mr chair and members
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh this is a
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill I believe in
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
um was presented to us for one
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
particular County last year um and in
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the RSA saw that Boro County
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
and Rockingham County had similar uh uh
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
competitive build bidding um rules and
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
so I felt it was better to make this the
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
same for all counties it's a common
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
sense way to get an effective um price
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
for your county and watch your budget
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think that um it serves the
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of uh making sure that every
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
county is operating the same way so that
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
there are no surprises I when we were
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
when I was doing the research on the on
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
the original Bill last year and saw that
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
two particular counties had been called
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
out the question is why why does that
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
not um affect every County or why is
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
this not a good tool for every County so
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I went ahead and submitted
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
this bill for All Counties as opposed to
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
time that's it thank you there is there
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
any other Miss hgan do you have
 
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.630 align:start position:0%
any other Miss hgan do you have
additional

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
Gilman good morning again Mr chairman
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
and members of the municipal and County
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
government uh committee my name is Kate
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
Morgan I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and this time I
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
am here on behalf of all 10 counties in
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
particular in this case your county
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
administrators uh the association is
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill while we understand
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
what the representative is attempting to
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
do you will note that I said in my last
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are 10 counties and
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
they each do things 10 different ways so
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
requiring Coos who has a very different
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
structure than Hillsboro to take
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding in the same way when
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
they may not have the same support staff
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
available able could be very challenging
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
for some of the smaller counties that's
 
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
why you'll notice in the statute the two
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
bigger counties with the largest staffs
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
have these competitive bidding rules uh
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
so the association would ask that you
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill today and I am happy to
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
has does the committee have any
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
wargan yes uh CH thank you Mr chairman
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony uh I
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
just took a quick look at 28a and that
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
in 28a it says that the Commissioners
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
have the right to wave the need for
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding there's some details
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
that they have to go through as far as
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
reporting are concerned but is is my
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
understanding this bill takes away the
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
the county commissioner's uh ability to
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
wave the need for competitive bidding I
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
read it that way yes representative
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you right thank
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.789 align:start position:0%
 
represa

01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
represa
 
01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:29.309 align:start position:0%
represa
so

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
um earlier this term we had another bill
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
related to competitive building bidding
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
by counties and it was just for Carol
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
County um if I yeah if I'm remembering
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
correctly um and I believe we rejected
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
it because we didn't want
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
to take an action that was just specific
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
to one County we want to do something
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
broader so are you saying that we should
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
have actually passed that one instead I
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
cannot make any comments on why this
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
body voted the way that it
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
did well did did you testify on the
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
previous Bill the Carol County bill I
 
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.230 align:start position:0%
previous Bill the Carol County bill I
did

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
follow well play
 
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.910 align:start position:0%
follow well play
Miss

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.710 align:start position:0%
Miss
yes

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
um some of us here on the committee are
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
also Selectmen and City councilors and
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
so forth I know in our case we have a
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process for our town
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
but there's an exception given for the
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
state bid
 
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
price and looking through this B bill I
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
don't see that exception being part of
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
it um and so I'm wondering if that's an
 
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.750 align:start position:0%
it um and so I'm wondering if that's an
oversight

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
or I am unsure representative you would
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
probably need to ask representative
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
Guth I'm sorry representative
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.390 align:start position:0%
Guth I'm sorry representative

microphone

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
question on line 28 section three it
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
says the award of a purchase is made
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
other than the lowest bidder a unanimous
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
vote of the Commissioners are required
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
why is
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
that again I would probably direct that
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
R mdon your microphone thank you there
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
we go um I'm I'm trying to understand
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
what the problem is by competitive
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
bidding why why is that an issue with
 
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.189 align:start position:0%
bidding why why is that an issue with
the

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
counties I my opinion is that there is
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
not an issue the two largest counties
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
have in statute a uh a competitive
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
bidding process and that makes sense for
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
them because they are are the two
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
largest counties smaller counties like
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
Coos and belnap do not have the same
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
resources that say Hillsboro OR
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham might have so to subject them
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the same standards that Hillsboro and
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
Rockingham have could provide additional
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
burden on the counties and I would argue
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
could result in having to expend some
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
additional funds to hire staff to
 
01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:50.189 align:start position:0%
additional funds to hire staff to
accomplish

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
that follow follow up yes what do your
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
your group recommend how are we supposed
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to control the competitive bidding
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
process of the Commissioners how do we
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that they do it at a certain
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
amount without a statute so there there
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
is a uh there is each county has a
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
policy on what is appropriate um and I
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
believe that your county delegation and
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
as a member of that County delegation
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
you have the right to weigh in on that
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
policy can I quote you on that sure okay
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
than you thank you representa there any
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
more comments from the committee
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
question by your um reasoning I'm sorry
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative stavis I'm sorry quite
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
all right by your reasoning isn't it
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
also possible that because of a lack of
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding that those countries
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
least able to pay for certain types of
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
services over
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
$5,000 might be getting charged more
 
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
than other counties who are doing
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding unless result in
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
higher expenses for their citizens thank
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
you representative I would argue that
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
each County does do competitive bidding
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
they just don't have a
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
formal statute of law that tells them
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
how to do it each county has a policy on
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
how they are going to do competitive
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
bidding so it's not like they aren't
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
doing it it's just it's not a formal
 
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.229 align:start position:0%
doing it it's just it's not a formal
statute

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
yes follow up go ahead so if they are
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
already doing it then what would be the
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem with a uniformity of doing it I
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
would say the problem would be resources
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative because these smaller
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
counties don't have the resources that a
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
hill store or Rockingham would
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
have thank you yes represent M thank you
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
question giving given all that you've
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
said do you see any um issues do you
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
take any issue with the considerations
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
that are listed here as being uh
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a county to follow in in
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
considering a qualified bidder I would
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to take that back to the county
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
administrators but I'm happy to do that
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
and bring that back to the committee
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representa any other
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none is are there any
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.679 --> 01:12:31.790 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
no no our our procedures have it that
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
when a representative introduces a bill
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
finished Mr chair we had representative
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:13:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
twice

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
well I think in this case uh what we can
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
do we can ask representative Gilman can
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
provide input but can't testify is that
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
to you can answer questions but you
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
can't offer a
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
testimon is that is that unclear enough
 
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.950 align:start position:0%
testimon is that is that unclear enough
for

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
the the reason that there's a little
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
confusion here is because we do have
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
a a rule in the house that when a
 
01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:37.709 align:start position:0%
a a rule in the house that when a
representative

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
testifies before a committee if they're
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
on that committee they have to step
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
aside for the balance of the uh
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee rejoin the committee during
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
executive session for all the questions
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
and answers so we're in a little bit of
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh soft ground here but go ahead in the
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the interest of providing more
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
information to our
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee you want to ask your question
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
or is there just an answer you want I
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted an answer to give um thank
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um uh representative lel's
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
asked about the uh bidding for uh State
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
procurement and that is under Section
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
seven it doesn't require going through
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
competitive building it's on
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
10 yes representative Matt you I I I
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
think this will fit into what you are uh
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
saying Mr chair and thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
online I got to go to this
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
it says if the award for the purchase is
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
made to other than the lowest
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
bidder is that supposed to read lowest
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
bidder or should that say lowest
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
responsible bidder as has been noted
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
previously I'm just curious if that's an
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
OSS mistake or if that's intentional and
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to speak to the intent
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
because I'll understand if if it's
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
written simple answer is yes okay thank
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Melvin you have
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
addition comment yes uh thank you and
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in
 
01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in
reference

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
283 if an award of a purchases made to
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
other than the lowest bidder and enous
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
vote by the County Commission is
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
well I think the concern is
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
um of a disagreement between whether
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
lowest bid is qualified from um all the
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
other in the list that um the the odd
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
man out or odd person out um needs to
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
convince the other two uh Commissioners
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
that going with other than the less
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
bitter lowest bidder which is
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
budgetarily um important
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
needs to to explain why that one is not
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily A best bit for the project
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
purchased thank you thank you

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
Northend neighborhoods colleagues I'm
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce House Bill 1275
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's an act relative to Municipal
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
representation on Regional planning
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
commissions with the bipartisan Federal
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment and jobs Act
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
of 20121 signed into law and in the
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
anticipation of over1 billion dollar in
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
federal funds becoming available to the
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in the coming
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
decade I filed this bill as an attempt
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
to bring more Equitable representation
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
to the cities of Manchester and nashwa
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
on their respective Regional planning
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
commissions currently uh every
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
municipality in the state of New
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regardless of population uh
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
gets at least two Representatives on
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
their Regional Planning Commission a
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
third representative is added for each
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
town with a population between 10 and
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
25,000 and a fourth rep is allocated for
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities with more than 25,000
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
residents but that's where the statutory
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
formula ends House Bill 1275 as drafted
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
filed and presented today proposes one
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative for each municipality and
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
an added an additional representative
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
for each additional 10,000 residents in
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
theory the legislation is simple
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward and addresses
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
my concern of an inequitable formula for
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
representation after the LSR was posted
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
I received an email from leadership at
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
the southern New Hampshire Regional
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission to ask for a meeting
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I welcome the opportunity to receive
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
feedback and through a series of
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
conversations with regional planning
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
commissions uh and staff from across the
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
state I crafted an amendment which
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
addresses unintended consequences of my
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted does the committee have
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
a copy of that Amendment uh no we don't
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm G to pass around both the
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
I would ask the uh the committee to
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
maintain a copy of the
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to perhaps be implemented at
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
review and so with a commitment to
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
listening learning and finding common
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
ground I'm also pleased to present uh
 
01:34:44.199 --> 01:34:46.030 align:start position:0%
ground I'm also pleased to present uh
Amendment

01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
0037 which is being circulated right now
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's an effort to address the concerns I
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
heard from the Regional planning
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
commissions namely decreasing smaller
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
towns Baseline representation from two
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
seats to only one and increasing
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester's repr representation from
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
four seats to 10 that was that's what's
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill the amendment
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
addresses uh that so instead this
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment it keeps Town's Baseline
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
representation at two seats a third seat
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
for municipalities over 10,000 residents
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
and a fourth seat
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
for municipalities over 25,000 residents
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
but it also adds a series of steps for
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
larger towns and cities adding an
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional rep at 45,000 residents
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
70,000 residents and finally 100,000
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
residents these steps increase
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
progressively with a rep being added
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
after the addition of 10,000 residents
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
then 15,000 20,000 25,000 and finally
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
30,000 residents above the previous
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
here something I learned through these
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
conversations is the strong Spirit of
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
regional cooperation between communities
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
on each Planning Commission there is
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
concern about unintended consequences of
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
big fish taking over small ponds so I
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
took that feedback into account as I uh
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
as I took a look at the formula uh
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
committed to keeping smaller communities
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
whole while making modest strides for
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
cities with more than 60,000 residents
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
by giving them a few extra seats at the
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
table the net impact of the amendment
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
increases nashua's representation from
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
four seats to six seats and Manchester's
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
representation from four seats to seven
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
seats on their Regional Planning
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
Commission in short Amendment 0037 it's
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
a goodfaith compromise aimed at
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
addressing concerns raised by the
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions while
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
staying true to the intent of this
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislation which is to provide our
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
states to larger cities my home town of
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
nasua and the community I now represent
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester with more proportional and
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
Equitable representation I urge the
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee members to send House Bill
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
1275 to the house floor with a strong
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan ought to pass as amended
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I welcome your
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you first question is
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
the is amendment
 
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.149 align:start position:0%
the is amendment
037

01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
037
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
that litigated through
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
OS it was submitted through OLS yes okay
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
so that that amendment can be considered
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
at exective session yes thank you thank
 
01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a scam setting
 
01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
question if you will can you describe to
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
me the kinds of inequities that may
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
result and possibly do result in
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions with where
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
proportional presentation such as you're
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
proposing in this bill is not present
 
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
what are the kinds of things that you
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
see happening that would be negative
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
should this not pass it's a great
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for it I
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it one thing I want to be
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
really clear about is this is not about
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
writing a wrong this is about
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating more than a billion dollars
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
in federal funding to our state in the
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
coming decade and
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
I think that you know I I'm I'm an
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
advocate for the constituents that I
 
01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
represent I have you know at every every
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm looking to make sure
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
that Manchester has uh you know a full
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
seat at the table it is unclear to me
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
what the uh debates might be at Regional
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
planning commissions over the course of
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
the next decade but I do want to make
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
sure that Manchester uh has has better
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
representation than that they have now
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
giving their proportional population so
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's unclear it's it's I can't
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate what those debates are going
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be or what the issues are going to be
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but in the same way that uh looking
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
at the you know redistricting proposal
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
for example um Manchester was allocated
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
32 seats while other proposals had 33 or
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
34 seats on in the house map um and so
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
those those are concerning as a a
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative of
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.629 align:start position:0%
representative of
Manchester

01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
in preparation for this hearing I
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
studied the language of the bill and my
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
understanding um as the bill is written
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
is currently representation is
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
proportional based on population my
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
concern would be that I I understand
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
your your rationale or argument but my
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
concern is and would you agree that the
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
the the bill and then the subsequent
 
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment would therefore increase the
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
influence of larger Towns at the expense
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
of smaller towns with your proposal to
 
01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:09.589 align:start position:0%
of smaller towns with your proposal to
increase

01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
representation um in the larger cities
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps specifically Manchester would
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
you agree with that
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
in would you agree that's that's what
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is doing thank you uh thank you
 
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
for the question
representative

01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh I want to be careful about that
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
particular characterization of the bill
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the attempt in the amendment
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
is to not decrease the representation of
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
any municipality as it stands now but
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
simply add additional tiers and
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
additional seats for those larger
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so I the the goal is
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
not to decrease representation for for
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
anybody you know the amendment really uh
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
tries to increase
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
representation uh for the cities of
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
nashille and
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester follow y followup so yes I
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
but the point being is that the result
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
of that while you're trying to increase
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
representation the effect of that would
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
be that it decreases representation of
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
smaller towns because as you scale you
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
know you're you're you're decreasing
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
representation that that's
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative I ask you to try to form
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
question W would you agree that the
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
result of of um the content of the bill
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
would be that the
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
towns

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that's one way to look at
 
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I'm sort of aren't
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
that knowledgeable I'm a selectman and
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
maybe I should be but uh could you tell
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
me what kind of votes that's where the
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
power is how what kind of votes the
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
commission would make would make
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
particularly regarding uh federal funds
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
coming into the
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
area yes thank you representative for
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
the question uh you know I think there
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
there will be sums of money that will be
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
allocated to the regional planning
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
commissions and it will be up to them to
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
decide how that money is
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
allocated um within within that region
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I think there's some
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
representatives from uh from Regional
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
planning commissions that that might be
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
able to speak to that in anticipation of
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
some of those the funds becoming
 
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
some of those the funds becoming
available

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's that's it you know
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's very much the purpose of the bill
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's an anticipation of the uh
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
investment thank thank you for your
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:28.589 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um each each Planning Commission has a
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
different number based on the number of
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are part of that
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission um this is
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
a net
 
01:43:37.639 --> 01:43:40.750 align:start position:0%
a net
increase

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
um of four
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
seats sorry of two seats for
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
nsha and three additional seats for
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester on their their respective
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and they're in
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
commissions

01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
know uh if I might representative when I
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
think about the the Brilliance of our
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
Founders uh in establishing a 400 member
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
House of
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives um I think I I just I
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of wisdom and a lot
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
of um you know it's incredible to be to
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
be able to have that kind of
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative democracy in our state
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
um the way the Caps are set up on the
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions at this
 
01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.510 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions at this
time

01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
um makes me as a resident of Manchester
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh feel like we're not getting our our
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
full seat at the table and so um you
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
know this is a this is an attempt to get
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit closer to that we know we
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
won't be nearly as close as the uh the
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
way it's broken down in the New
 
01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house for example um but it's
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
a step towards uh better representation
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the bigger
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions hi so I represent conquered
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
which is the third largest city after
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester and nashaa so um
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding the formulas
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
correctly here um its representation
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
would be unchanged in both the unamended
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
and amended Bill and as it currently is
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
for Representatives either
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
way uh thank you representative for the
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
question uh I'd have to take another
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
look at the original bill but under the
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendment conquer's representation would
 
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
stay the
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
another um so
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
um one thing I like about the unamended
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
version is that it's future proof so
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
someday have a city in New Hampshire
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
with say a million residents or whatever
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
um their representation will
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
automatically be adjusted to be
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
proportional to their population but
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the amended
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
version um it seems we we would have to
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
with the amended version we would have
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
to um keep coming back to add new tiers
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
whenever cities grow certain amounts to
 
01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.070 align:start position:0%
whenever cities grow certain amounts to
um

01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
continue uh keeping it proportional is
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.589 align:start position:0%
continue uh keeping it proportional is
that

01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
correct under under the formula in the
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
date we would not have to update the
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
formula until we get over any
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
municipality is over
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
135,000 residents that would be the next
 
01:47:36.669 --> 01:47:36.679 align:start position:0%
that would be the next step up so I
 
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
think there's probably going to be some
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
time before we would need to do that
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
um followup um Can Can you remind me
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
what the current population of
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester is it's
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
115,000 in change okay thanks thank you
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
I as a selectman in my own town um we
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
think about how hard it is to get
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers uh to different boards and
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
commissions and we're so grateful when
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
when we do get them do you do you uh
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
could you see a situation where you just
 
01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
might not be able to find seven
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh for these or six
 
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.270 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh for these or six
represent

01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
and not and and not solve the problem
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that you are trying to solve or do you
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
know if there is that upwelling of
 
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
support out there that these seats would
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
be filled uh thank you representative
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
for the question uh I do know that uh
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
the the spirit of service within our
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
state and certainly within my community
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh I know that the mayor's office in
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester has a list of people that
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
have raised their hand and said they're
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
willing to serve erve on any number of
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions you know
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
within the city uh and I wouldn't
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate there being a challenge
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
filling uh the additional seats at least
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
in in Manchester not sure about NASA but
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
they've got a slightly less uh steep
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
steep hill de clim so to speak but I'm
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty confident that uh there are
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
some engaged citizens who would be
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
excited about the opportunity to serve
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
will thank you for taking my question um
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at the amendment I in
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I represent marac Hillsboro 21 and
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
we would go from two representatives to
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
four and when you because we have a
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
population of around 27,000 people um
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then you know when I hear you say
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
the addition to nasua
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
representation um I'm imagining in my
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
head these unwieldy commissions with
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
lots of people that are going to have
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
more of a difficulty reaching a
 
01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
more of a difficulty reaching a
consensus

01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me and I think
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative P this is kind of a
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
followup to his is what's the actual
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
size of some of these Regional planning
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
commissions for instance the Southern
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Regional Planning
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
Commission or in my case the Nashville
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission are we
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the representation by 10%
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
20% uh thank you representative for the
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is that
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
miramac is already entitled
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.669 align:start position:0%
miramac is already entitled
to

01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
let me just double
 
01:50:23.159 --> 01:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
let me just double
check

01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
so I think they're at the 25,000
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
threshold as as it exists right now in
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
State Statute I'm almost certain that
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
Marram maac's entitled to four seats so
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think miramac is changing and
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
someone can correct me if I'm wrong but
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's my understanding when I
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
read the current statute um my
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the only cities
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
that would increase their
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh their representation on these
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions are
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester and nashwa uh and I can get
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
that information if you're interested in
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh learning more about the size of uh
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
the regional Planning Commission than M
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
Maxa thank you I'll check I I think we
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
only have two now but I'll I'll check um
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
myself but that that would be my concern
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
is that this amendment might create
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
these unwi de large commissions that um
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
just have more difficulty moving forward
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
on issues but thank you very much for
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
your commitment to representation thank
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
you addition question
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
question um you've started me thinking
 
01:51:39.679 --> 01:51:40.669 align:start position:0%
question um you've started me thinking
about

01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
something that fortunately I wasn't
 
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about before now it's troubling
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
me which
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
is I represent LE Le Lebanon has a base
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
population of between 13 and 14,000
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
people but every single day seven days a
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
week we provide infrastructure and
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
services for upwards of 60,000 people
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
who work at Dart petock Medical Center
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
University at the large Tech firms all
 
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.790 align:start position:0%
University at the large Tech firms all
around

01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
Lebanon how how would this formula help
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
a municipality such as Lebanon doesn't
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for the population yet
 
01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.270 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for the population yet
must

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
must
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
support that those not similar numbers
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
of people with
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure especially with an
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill on the
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
horizon how would we how would we deal
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
with that how is that fair and Equitable
 
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
for a city like
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
Lebanon thank you representative for the
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
question and I I'm having a little bit
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
tough time hearing with the the air
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
circulation and so if I don't get this
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
answer if I'm not answering your
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
question please let me know and we can
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
take another another step at it um one
 
01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
of the things that I've learned through
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill is that oftentimes municipalities
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
even if they have their two
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the regional Planning
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
Commission only one of them sometimes is
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
able to attend those
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
meetings um I think that the
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
way another thing that I've learned is
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a real commitment to the
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
region as part of these conversations I
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think any any municipality is
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
trying to Short change any others um but
 
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that and in hopes of answering your
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
question um I think the the more voices
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
that are in the room who can help to
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
share different perspectives on
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
challenges and and benefits of of
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
different policy proposals that come
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
through the regional Planning Commission
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
um the better and I think all those
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
those voices at the table fit together
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
like a puzzle that's the that's the kind
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
of visual that I've been working with um
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling like I'm probably not
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
answering your question so I'm happy to
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
take another stab at if you want to
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
repeat it I suspect it's an unanswerable
 
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
question okay I just wanted to put it
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
out there ether because is making me
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
think about other communities that have
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
this kind of population issue but
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't claim it as an issue
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
because the hosing isn't there to
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
support all those
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
folks thank you thank
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representa as a reminder
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you are not
 
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
speaking who haven't been recognized to
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
speak please turn your microphone off it
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
helps to reduce the hiss that the
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh those that might be listening online
 
01:54:58.750 --> 01:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah are there any other questions from
 
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.629 align:start position:0%
yeah are there any other questions from
the

01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:59.639 --> 01:55:03.069 align:start position:0%
the
committee

01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman thank you for
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I am a member of
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
the Southern New Hampshire plan Planning
 
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
Commission and uh as
 
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.430 align:start position:0%
Commission and uh as
such

01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I find that your bill misses a
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
couple things uh we currently are
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to have alternat on on the
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission and I see that your
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make any uh uh allowance
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
for that is this an oversight or is that
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
intentional uh thank you for the
 
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.310 align:start position:0%
intentional uh thank you for the
question

01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative I don't I I'd be curious
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
to know if alternates are currently
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
written into State Statute uh because
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
that was not something that came up in
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
my conversations with OS about this
 
01:55:48.599 --> 01:55:50.270 align:start position:0%
my conversations with OS about this
bill

01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
oh well I I follow up yes follow uh I'm
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
not really sure whether it's in the rsas
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I I do know that uh
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
there alternates because I was alternate
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
for a while you but uh uh my my that's
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
not really what uh I want to this is a
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
followup I'd like to ask about
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh the allowance for uh counties to have
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
representation on
 
01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
the the Planning Commission this is
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
lines 14 and
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
15 of the amendment or the original bill
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
of the amendment okay do the uh do the
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
counties currently have representation
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
on the Planning
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
Commission uh I am unaware of counties
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
having currently having representation
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the Planning
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
Commission because I I I follow one more
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh because the uh the thing is like the
 
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
southern planning uh Southern New
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Planning Commission uh we
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
represent probably uh two or three
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
counties so that would be you know the
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
addition of say six more people onto the
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission and uh uh as one of the other
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative said you know this begins
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
to get a little unwieldy with the number
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
know so like I said it was this was this
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
something that uh was intentional to add
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
the the the counties to the uh Planning
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
Commission no
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
I there is no there's no intention to
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
add counties to the Planning Commission
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying I'm trying to figure out
 
01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:33.639 align:start position:0%
where in
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's it starts at uh line 12 and goes to
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
15 and says in any County or counties
 
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
which a origional Planning Commission
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
has been formed the County May by
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
resolution of its County Commissioners
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
become a member of said Regional
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission shall be atted
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to appoint two Representatives
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:57.709 align:start position:0%
 
commission

01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
oh minut I have that was the original
 
01:58:02.199 --> 01:58:03.430 align:start position:0%
oh minut I have that was the original
Bill

01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
okay but uh that verbage is is in the
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
21 the way that I read that and i' I'd
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
be you know we can get some
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
clarification on this is that
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the regional Planning
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
Commission they may be elected or
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
us uh of the municipality or the county
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
so uh each municipality is still
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
entitled to a certain number of
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives the county is not
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to any
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative me ask that before we get
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
to Executive session which probably
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
about three or four weeks but I ask you
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
to bring back to
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
us the answer about and substitutes
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
Regional Commission be
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
seated that seems like a rather large
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
hole for us
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%

substitutes and how they fit into this
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Association of regional
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
planning commissions as well as from our
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
commission is that uh we absolutely
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
support the the amendment to
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
to retain the the two the Baseline of
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
the two representatives for commissions
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%

02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
and and comment about volunteerism and
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
participation we uh We've we've had some
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
great runs with some of our
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
representatives for many years serving
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
our smaller communities two of them and
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
we really you know that was my first
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
take and I think the the first take of
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh the directors and and commissioners
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the smaller commissions that you know
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of the you know base of our
 
02:01:21.069 --> 02:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
commissions made up of smaller
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
communities to retain that that Baseline
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
of two I can't speak today to the
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
amendment related to Nash and uh and the
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
southern Hampshire planing Commission in
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester relative to the the proposed
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
changes I believe they executive
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
committees are going going to review the
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
the amended language and we'll be able
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
to come back with that but um I I did
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
want to say also that you know I I I had
 
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
my 22nd anniversary yesterday of uh
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
starting here here at uh Central
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
Regional planning and um I love when
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
when folks are talking about Regional
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
planning and it's you know it's near and
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
dear um I I did work for the uh the
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
southwest region Planning Commission in
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
my first job back in the 80s and and uh
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
so spent a fair amount of time with uh
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know working on on Regional issues
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I I wanted to emphasize how you know
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
that that that that Regional cooperation
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
and and that approach is really I think
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
a Hallmark of the of the planning
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
commissions and you know some of the
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
conversations that we have relative to
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding whether it's the 10year plan uh
 
02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
projects coming out of the 10 year plan
 
02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
I think you know for our Planning
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
Commission we work very hard to find the
 
02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:37.470 align:start position:0%
Commission we work very hard to find the
best

02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
projects and sometimes the best projects
 
02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
are unconquered sometimes the best
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
projects that year for the 10-year plan
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
are in dumbar or Warner and I think the
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
our our trans Transportation advisory
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee which makes recommendations to
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
our full commission I think has has you
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
know tried to to to follow that approach
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
over the many years that that we have
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
worked on these issues it's going to be
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
very interesting to see what the uh
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
02:03:08.189 --> 02:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
means um and we really were learning
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
more about that all the time but you
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
know our experience has been with the
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
the 10year plan or the transportation
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
Alternatives program which is you know
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
the the rail trail projects the two
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
projects that came out of our region one
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
was in conquer for this last cycle one
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
was in
 
02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
Warner uh followed closely by a project
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
that did not get funded we hope to get
 
02:03:31.709 --> 02:03:31.719 align:start position:0%
funded and hop so uh I think there was a
 
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
lot of participation among all our all
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
our all of our commissioners and
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I would open it up if you had any
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%

not be affected by by any of the changes
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
question how many Regional planning
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
commissions are there in the state there
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
there are nine Regional planning comms
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
so uh four of them are are mpos
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
Metropolitan planning organizations so
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
more of the the the manchesters Nas and
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
then five rural planning commissions of
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
which Central Regional planning
 
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
commissions that's based upon Federal
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
designation for the uh Transportation
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
Planning process
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman yes go
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
ahead for a
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
municipality that sits on the
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
edge of a of one
 
02:05:04.159 --> 02:05:06.030 align:start position:0%
edge of a of one
Planning

02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
Planning
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
Commission but is affected by another
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
for instance I represent the Fairly
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
rural but Suburban town of
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
Lichfield which is part of the national
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission but we are
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the airport sure in
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we're impacted greatly by
 
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.669 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we're impacted greatly by
the

02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
airport and maybe not so much by the
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
nashwa regional Planning
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
Commission and the reason I ask is
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussion about
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
Rail and ra
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
rail if it was to be
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
implemented would surely not touch
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
Lichfield because we have a river
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
between us and and the uh current rail
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so if there was a whole
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
bunch of money spent on
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
rail by the nashille regional Planning
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
Commission then witfield if I was a
 
02:06:23.310 --> 02:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
member of the Nashville Regional
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission which I am
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
not but I would feel that we would be
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
left out by that but if there was
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
something going on with the airport in
 
02:06:38.589 --> 02:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester then that would directly
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
impact us Mr representative I ask you to
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
try to turn that into a question yes
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
based upon your
 
02:06:52.990 --> 02:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
experience uh how can the small town of
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
Lichfield make sure that it gets proper
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
representation and influence on both of
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
those you know it's it I think it comes
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
back to the the participation in the
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
transportation advisory committees and
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
the that that process specifically uh I
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
do know that there's an awful lot of
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
coordination between the nationville
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission and
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Planning
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
Commission you know on rail issues but
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
all Transportation all issues basically
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
um those boundaries were were drawn in
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
the 60s for the regional planning
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
commissions and I know that we have we
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
have spent a fair amount of time talking
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
about that sometimes with our our
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
commission our towns that are right on
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
the border and work very hard to to to
 
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
work with our adjacent Regional planning
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
commissions honestly I think it does
 
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
come back though to that just like you
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
know there that that process that that
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
Regional process to you know sometimes
 
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
there is a project that's not going to
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
impact a town directly but the next one
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
will so I think participating in the in
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
continually um is is a way to kind
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.599 --> 02:08:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr TARTA for taking my
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
question um there there were previous
 
02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh POS I I I posed one of them
 
02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
about the size of the commissions um
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
what is the size even though conquer or
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
the the regional Planning Commission
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that you're associated with
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be impacted by this bill but
 
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
what what's the size of the commission
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
how many so so we have we have 20 our
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
Comm our our commission is 20
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
communities so 19 of them have two
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
representatives and then city of conquer
 
02:08:49.709 --> 02:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
has four okay so um if this and I do
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
have to say I you mentioned your tenure
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the regional Planning Commission uh
 
02:08:57.069 --> 02:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
one of my first jobs was as an intern
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
for the Nashville Regional Planning
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
Commission summer of 76 I'm dating
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
myself sure but it was a great
 
02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
experience assuming that some of these
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
commissions may actually expand by
 
02:09:10.559 --> 02:09:11.669 align:start position:0%
commissions may actually expand by
several

02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:09:11.679 --> 02:09:13.470 align:start position:0%
several
members

02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
um as an administrator how do you see
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
that being impacted at that
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
administrative level for just the
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
day-to-day responsibilities of the
 
02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission office I
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
think you know there there there are
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
more seats at the table and um I think
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
administratively you know we work
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
closely with the staff of all the of all
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
the cities the and the towns that have
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
staff planning commissions actually
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
serve as a staff for some of the smaller
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
communities you know for our circuit
 
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
Rider planning
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
programs and even respective to the
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
question question about Lebanon I I know
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
that Upper Valley would work it works
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
very closely with the with the city
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
staff the town staff you know and all
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
the communities so um administratively I
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
can't really comment on it other than
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that there there there is
 
02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
always very close particip or close
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
coordination between uh the regional
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%

02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman I just wanted to
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
um say that you know uh when the member
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
asked a question about uh County's
 
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.549 align:start position:0%
asked a question about uh County's
participation

02:10:45.549 --> 02:10:45.559 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I need to do a little bit more
 
02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:50.559 align:start position:0%
research on that piece um you know I
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
think your experience with regional
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
planning commissions you you you know
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
that counties participate and I think
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
that varies you know across the
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
different uh commissions so when I uh
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
report back to the committee I'm also
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
going to include some information about
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
the counties as well just so everybody
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
has an understanding of the makeup um of
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
each of these nine commissions across
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
the state so I just want to apologize
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
for not having that information right at
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
the at the top of my head and for
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
assuming the counties were not not part
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
of it you know I was reading further
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
into the statute and of course they are
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
if they elect to be part of thank you
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
very much we do have a couple of weeks
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.709 --> 02:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
react okay seeing no additional comments
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%

exemption

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%

um I was asked to contact him and I
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
completely forgot because I have I've
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
had five major bills that I had to
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
introduce and I've been completely
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
swamped so I really apologize um um Mr
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
Vice chair um but I'm happy to talk to
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
you about this at length um
 
02:13:58.990 --> 02:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
so uh HB 1387 which my co-sponsors have
 
02:14:01.229 --> 02:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh affectionately named the freedom to
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
create a home act um I want to to start
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
by talking about two crises in this
 
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
state that I think everybody here is are
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with the first is the
 
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
housing crisis um we have always for a
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
long time now have had a housing crisis
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
in this State uh where people um have a
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time finding housing within
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
their means but certainly that has been
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
exac exacerbated in the last couple
 
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
years uh by housing uh the housing
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
market inflating um the other crisis is
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
what is often referred to as the graying
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um the inability of New
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to seem to attract young
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
people or keep its own young people um
 
02:14:46.109 --> 02:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
buying homes and creating you know
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
starting families in this state
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh so these are are two issues that get
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
talked about the gr of New Hampshire in
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
particular we we talk a lot about you
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
know different ideas of how to attract
 
02:14:58.830 --> 02:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
young people sometimes you hear things
 
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
like maybe more theme parks or something
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
but we don't talk about the thing and as
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
a person who came to this state as a
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
young person um around the age of 30 I
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
can tell you what the thing is it's
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
housing it's it is almost impossible as
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
a young person to buy a home in the
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
state and most young people who are
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
freshly married or with their Partners
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
or however whatever life they're
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
choosing to live they want to buy a home
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is extremely
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
attractive I came uh to New Hampshire to
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
get my Master's Degree but um I wanted
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
to stay because it had everything I
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
loved Four Seasons mountains ocean
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
everything but my dream was to always
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
buy a farm I've had that dream for 20
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
years and to this day despite living in
 
02:15:48.189 --> 02:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
this state for 13 years now I I have not
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
been able to buy a property and not
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
because I don't work or my husband
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't work but because whenever we go
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
and look at the market we see properties
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
that the mortgage is within our means
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
but then the property tax doubles what
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
we would have to pay on a monthly basis
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
so there is literally nothing that we
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
can get that we can afford because of
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
the property tax and that is not in all
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
a unique story that is the um experience
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
of almost every young person but not
 
02:16:18.189 --> 02:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
just young people but those are people
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we want to stay here and buy homes
 
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
here but retired people who already own
 
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
their homes who can't afford to stay in
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
their homes or disabled people people
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
who are going through life transitions
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
whether they be divorces illnesses
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
especially right now with changes and
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
jobs um there are many many stories
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
where people cannot afford to either buy
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
a home where we obviously want people to
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
buy homes we we all acknowledge the
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
benefits of home ownership or or they
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
can't afford to stay in the home that
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
they've already purchased even in some
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
cases when they own it outright purely
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
because of property
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
taxes now as I mentioned property taxes
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
um a predominant cause of the first
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
problem the housing crisis one of the
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
main problems certainly we have the
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
housing market and inflation also to
 
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
look at but it is the predominant uh
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
cause of the the graying and making it
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
so that no property is is really
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
affordable and it's really sad because
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
in some cases people are taxed out of
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
their ability to just live and I think
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a human and I would even go
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
further I would say it's almost an
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
animal instinct to want to just have a
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
small corner to call your own a little
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
home to say I am safe and secure and
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is My Sanctuary no matter how small
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
or modest but that's a basic kind of
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
need so this this bill before you and I
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
I do have an amendment that um I'll talk
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
about how the amendment was formed in a
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
second but this bill is tax relief on
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
the people who we want most to have the
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
tax relief the tax relief on the young
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
people that we want to attract and keep
 
02:18:08.190 --> 02:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
here and then the tax relief on the
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
elderly disabled people in transitions
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
as I've already mentioned who already
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
own their home so I want to very briefly
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
talk about um economics and tax Theory I
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
know that's a little bit wonky and dry
 
02:18:24.509 --> 02:18:24.519 align:start position:0%
but please bear with me um in general
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
when we talk about taxes you might have
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
a percentage for a tax whether that be
 
02:18:32.349 --> 02:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
an income tax of sales tax what have you
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
the idea is that the more you earn or in
 
02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
the case of sales tax the more you buy
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the more you're paying because that
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
percentage in you know the percentage
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
stays the same but the amount of the
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
percentage represents the more it's um
 
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
the base of the tax is increased the
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
more the tax is right in uh absolute
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
numbers however that idea of taxing
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
everything at a certain percentage uh
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
does not take into account costs that uh
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
economists call inelastic inelastic
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
costs are costs that don't just grow as
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
your income grows but there there's a
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
limit to how much it can shrink as your
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
income shrinks so for example everybody
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
needs a certain number of calories to
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
live those calories cost money in terms
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
of buying food a gallon of milk is a
 
02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
gallon of milk no matter how much money
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
you make you have to have food a gallon
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
of gas is a gallon of gas no matter how
 
02:19:33.790 --> 02:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
much money you make there's a certain
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
cost to living that no matter how little
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
money you make you cannot shrink below
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
that cost of living it just doesn't
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
shrink with you so you start to get into
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
a place where you simply can't afford to
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
live that's in elastic costs of all the
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
inelastic costs that exist and this is
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
again economic theory um the one the mo
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is most basic uh after air water
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
and food is housing housing is not only
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
the most basic of our of our living
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
needs but it is also um the primarily
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
the largest of all of our expenses for
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
most people unless you're like a Jeff
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
Bezos person or
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
whatever your number one cost in life on
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month basis is usually
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
housing so it's really unfortunate that
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
that largest cost you have is also one
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
of the most
 
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
inelastic there is no such thing as $100
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
housing or a, home there's no such thing
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
as that it it only goes so low and then
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
if you can't afford the lowest there is
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
you're out of
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
luck so uh because housing is the
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
biggest expense for the vast majority
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
and is very El in elastic um
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
we but we don't have and so let me back
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
up with income taxes federal income
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
taxes for example you have U to account
 
02:20:58.510 --> 02:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
for that um inelastic costs of of uh
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
basic living we have something like
 
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
standardized deductions right that's an
 
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
amount that the government says okay
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is a basic amount that you need to
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
just live we're not going to tax you on
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the first 12,000 or 20,000 of your
 
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
income because you need that just to
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
live sorry was that like a I didn't
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
there was a sound um but we don't have a
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
standardized deduction when it comes to
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
property tax we don't give people an
 
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
amount that hey we're not going to tax
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
you on the first X number of dollars of
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
housing because you need that just to
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
live so it's unfortunate that the
 
02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
largest expense that we have the most
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
inelastic expense that we have also
 
02:21:43.150 --> 02:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any kind of deduction or
 
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
exemption so this is a tax structure
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
when you don't account for those
 
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
inelastic costs C that's a tax structure
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
that economists call regressive in the
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
sense that the less money someone makes
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
with that tax structure they are paying
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
effectively a larger percentage in
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
comparison to their living
 
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
costs um which means our current system
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
is actually taxing the very people we
 
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
want to give tax breaks to th those
 
02:22:09.389 --> 02:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
young people and the people in
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
transition all those people that we want
 
02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
to help out and make sure that they can
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
afford homes here we're taxing them the
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
most effectively in comparison with
 
02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
their cost of
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
living so what do we do so this bill so
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the history on this um for this
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
particular bill I contacted the budget
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
office they gave me a little bit of help
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
I spoke extensively over a few months
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
with the Dr Who were very sympathetic
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
and helpful but I really wanted a
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
mathematician right and I started
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
petitioning people online to uh
 
02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
mathematicians to help me with this
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a mathematician I had to
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
sign off on the bill with my best
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
understanding from the people I talked
 
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
to to the with the at the Dr it wasn't
 
02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
until after I signed off on the bill
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
that I was actually able to work really
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
closely with not just a PhD
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
mathematician but actually the chair of
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
the department he teaches at uh at the
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
college he teaches mathematics at um so
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment that tweaks this
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill in the way that the mathematician
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
suggested um and I'll go into the
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
details of that but essentially what
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
this does um is say that and this is an
 
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
enabling piece of legislation mind you
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
this is literally only giving
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities the option to to adopt
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
this if the voters in the town vote for
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
it taxpayers always for all property tax
 
02:23:33.710 --> 02:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues the taxpayers are the ones that
 
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
vote on how the the property tax is
 
02:23:39.469 --> 02:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
raised and how it's spent so this is no
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
different this is allowing the voters of
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
every town to say how they want to
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
manage their property taxes and what it
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
does do is allow them to adopt a an
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
exemption a homestead exemption Florida
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
has a similar homestead exemption um of
 
02:23:57.269 --> 02:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
about 50,000 that's across the board
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
this has um you have to meet certain
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications to get this exemption so
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
for every resident in a town or every
 
02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
household in a town that's below the
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
median uh home value in that town and
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's the only property they own and
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
their home or their uh household income
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
is at or below the median household
 
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
income in that town those people would
 
02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for the exemption now my goal
 
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
was to give them a a basic living cost
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
exemption of half the median value in
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
that home in that town excuse me so if
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
the the average home value in New
 
02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 350,000 so if a town that's
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
an average Town U has an average home
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
value of
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
350,000 the idea is is that people could
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
get up to the first 175,000 of Home
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
provided they don't have an opulent home
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's over the average provided that
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have over the average income
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
and provided it's their only home could
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
get up to
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
175,000 uh the first 175,000 tax free
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
and then would pay taxes on the
 
02:25:10.030 --> 02:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
rest representative excuse me
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
your demonstrated passion is certainly
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
admirable but if you could help me get
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
discussion to a point where the
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee can start asking you questions
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
so I'd appreciate if you could take a
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
look at what what else what other points
 
02:25:26.830 --> 02:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
are very important for you to make and
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
then we can open it up to the committee
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
to ask you questions I appreciate that
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
and I am getting into more of the meet I
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
do have a chart this is more of the
 
02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
technical details um and I realized that
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
this this particular hearing started
 
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
so also in the amendment by the way it
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
allow allows towns to adopt a 10-year
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
limit on the exemption so that any
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
particular resident would only receive
 
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
this if they wanted if the town wanted
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
to extend it to them for a maximum of 10
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
years and it changes the formula so it
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
still allows that half of the median
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
home value as an exemption but it is um
 
02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
calculated by subtracting the home's
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
value from the median home value so that
 
02:26:10.590 --> 02:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
there's no longer a cliff the way I had
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
written it before not being a
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
mathematician there was a drop off point
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
the new amendment makes it so there's no
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
drop pop off points so if the median
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
value is 350 and you have a
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
$349,000 home you get a $1,000
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
exemption so there have been other
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
attempts to deal with the housing crisis
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
um in the past we've all heard about
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
things like affordable housing projects
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
or Workforce housing um there are is a
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing requirement on towns
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
this is the opposite so affordable
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
housing projects are when the government
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
tells a developer you have to give a
 
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
certain amount discount to certain types
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
of people off the fair market value of a
 
02:26:59.269 --> 02:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
home for them to buy it this does not at
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
all impact the market value everyone has
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
to buy a property at the fair market
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
value this has nothing to do with the
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
private Market this is literally getting
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
the government in terms of taxes off the
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
backs of the people who need to have the
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
breathing room in order to to engage in
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
the private housing market further
 
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
because there are Workforce housing
 
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
requirements on some towns towns can use
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
this in order to meet those Workforce
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
housing requirements without a single
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
development because this applies to all
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
existing homes you don't have to build
 
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
any new projects you don't have to touch
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
density you don't have to do deal with
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
any of those things that honestly not
 
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
only do people not want to see higher
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
density in their in their towns but for
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
the most part people who might have to
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
buy the the the these Workforce housing
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to live in high density areas
 
02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
either it's not something that people
 
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
like most people want to buy a home and
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
communities all acknowledge that the
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
higher the home ownership is in a town
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
the more stability you have in that town
 
02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
the more Goodwill toward between
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
residents you have in that town the more
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
investment you have from members of the
 
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
Town into the the town's workings so it
 
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
all um in enforces the idea that we want
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
people to own homes and people want to
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
own homes further when we talk about
 
02:28:21.870 --> 02:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing projects in Workforce
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
housing we're usually talking about
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
rentals so we it wouldn't be increasing
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
home ownership the way this would
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
be so here is the big deal how much will
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
it cost ah so I wanted to First say that
 
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
as a warrant article usually this would
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
have a tax increase associated with it
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
that tax increase would apply to
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who doesn't qualify for the
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
exemption right um naturally there are
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
other ways to pay for this I have a
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
little pet idea of every town should
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
start a thrift store and then you would
 
02:28:57.790 --> 02:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
like take burden off your town dump and
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
have all these like cool things from the
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
town but that's beside the point one of
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
my co-sponsors said you could bond it
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
for the first year and just see how it
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
works but let's just say worst case
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
scenario the town has to in increase
 
02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
taxes on those other residents that
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't get this
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
exemption when you do the math and we've
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
done the
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
math the increase is really nominal and
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
the reason the increase is nominal let
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
me just direct you and it was poorly
 
02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
printed because it's very dark to the
 
02:29:30.429 --> 02:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
first chart here this is a very average
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
distribution of home values in a New
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
England town uh the professor that I'm
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
working with actually teaches about
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
property values as an exception to the
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
normal random distribution when you
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
normally find a bell curve in nature
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
property values don't follow the bell
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
curve if you can imagine why let's say
 
02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
your average home is 350,000 in that
 
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
town you might have homes like on this
 
02:29:58.349 --> 02:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
chart 900,000 over a million you it's
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
impossible to have a home that's the
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
same value less than
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
350,000 as there are homes over 350,000
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
so there's no negative $500,000 homes
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's no zero doll homes and there's
 
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
really no $50,000 homes so there's a
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
steep drop off on the left and the curve
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
is skewed right and this is actually a
 
02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
good thing and the reason it's good is
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
because it means your tax base for
 
02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
everything that's higher than the
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
average your tax base is quite wide
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
which means you don't have to raise
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
taxes that much in order to recoup the
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
costs for the
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
exemption so when we do the math it
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
turns out and every time that we've gone
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
through these numbers you have to raise
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
taxes about 8% not points not points
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
that means if you pay $100 in taxes as a
 
02:30:50.269 --> 02:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
person who doesn't get the exemption
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
with someone with an expensive home
 
02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
you'll pay $108 in taxes if you pay
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
$1,000 in taxes you'll pay 1080 if you
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
pay $10,000 in taxes a year you'll pay
 
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
10,800 it turns out for a person who has
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
a home just slightly above average so a
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
$400,000 home if they're paying $8,000 a
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
year they'll pay
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
860 um or $8,600 a year which works to
 
02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:17.790 align:start position:0%
860 um or $8,600 a year which works to
about

02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
$56 a month which is about the same as
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
taking someone out to lunch or maybe a
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
high-end lunch or a lowend dinner and I
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
would contend that if I can take one of
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
my neighbors out every month to lunch
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
and have that mean in exchange that
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
everyone in that town has the ability to
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
buy a modest little Home of Their Own
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
and have all of that investment and all
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
of that social cohesion that that home
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
ownership means I contend that that's
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
worth that lunch
 
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
especially for people who do have those
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
high-end homes and who don't are not
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
under the the average um
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
income but probably most importantly and
 
02:32:00.429 --> 02:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
and by the way there's a uh a chart on
 
02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
the back that shows you the exemptions
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
for each of the values in we kind of
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
created the theoretical perfectly
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
average New Hampshire town turns out the
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
average New Hampshire town has a th000
 
02:32:15.790 --> 02:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
homes the average home price is 350,000
 
02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
so this is using that average Town um
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
what you could see for exemptions versus
 
02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:25.830 align:start position:0%
what you could see for exemptions versus
taxable

02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
valuation but ultimately and I am
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
wrapping up right now um and there are
 
02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
projections in the bill the select board
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
has leeway to adjust because the the
 
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
income it turns out the Dr said although
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
we have it's very easy to go on Google
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
and say what's the average um household
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
income in New Market and you can get an
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
answer that's you know well backed up
 
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
it turns out the IRS apparently the Dr
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
says the IRS has no um obligation to
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
answer questions to towns if they want
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
to know what the average household
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
income in that town is and so in order
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
to get over that hurdle that we couldn't
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee the IRS would communicate with
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
the town um we're leaving I'm leaving in
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
the bill a little bit of leeway for the
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
select board to adjust what that um what
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
they recogniz as the average income in
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
that town so if they need to they can
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
dial that down so fewer residents
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
qualify but all of the um all of the
 
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
graphs and and everything that you're
 
02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
seeing in the
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
8% um those those numbers I quoted you
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's presuming every single resident
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
qualifies so finally I and I know this
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
is a new idea and I know new ideas can
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
be really scary but I know that also
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in the state just isn't
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
working Aeros Smith has a quote if you
 
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
always do what you've always done you'll
 
02:33:43.349 --> 02:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
always get what you've always got and
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we're at housing
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
has been unaffordable for a lot of young
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
people and other people who even bought
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
their home and are just paying taxes
 
02:33:54.429 --> 02:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
only and still are having a problem it's
 
02:33:56.590 --> 02:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
gotten to a situation right now where if
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
you need a home I could literally give
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
you one outright and you may not be able
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
to live in it simply because of taxes so
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
um I think we we need to stop nibbling
 
02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
around the edges with like things like
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know small affordable housing
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
projects here and there and start to
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
really tackle the you know the the
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
reason some of the properties are too
 
02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
expensive I'm fine with any number of
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
amendments as long as we're offering
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
substantial tax relief property tax
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
relief specifically to the people who
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
need it um and whoever provides that
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
relief in the state and therefore take
 
02:34:34.269 --> 02:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
significant steps to addressing those
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
crises that I mentioned those people
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
will be heralded as Heroes I think
 
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the number one
 
02:34:42.750 --> 02:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
issues in this state so thank you so
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
much for listening to all the technical
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
details and with that I will take
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much representative
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
Reed and thank you for taking my
 
02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
question um on on your handout you have
 
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
a bullet near the Autumn it says all
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
property tax decisions rightly are made
 
02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
by the taxpayers in the state um my
 
02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
question is in in coming from a a town
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
of miramac where we get uh considerable
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
tax revenue from anheiser Bush and
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
Fidelity and Investments this would
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
increase their taxes and do you think
 
02:35:25.630 --> 02:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
that increase in in property tax for the
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
industrial commercial base may be a
 
02:35:30.190 --> 02:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
deterrent to having new businesses come
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire in these
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
communities well so just like I said The
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
Wider the tax Bas the less the increase
 
02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why you're only seeing a few
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
dollars increase I don't think so
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
because the more corporations the less
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
the burden again it's a very nominal
 
02:35:48.269 --> 02:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
increase and it's still very competitive
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
with other states so I don't think that
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's an issue I mean the real issue
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
is that we're not competitive now in
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
terms of housing right that's the real
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
issue we can't get young people into the
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
state because we're really not
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
competitive when it comes to housing um
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you did point out that bullet
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
point because as you all know our entire
 
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
country was founded on the idea of no
 
02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
taxation without representation right
 
02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have to be the ones that
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
make the decisions about where the taxes
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
go and how they're raised so I think
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's only right to allow the taxpayers
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
of every town to vote on this on their
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
warrant article do they want to see a a
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
less regressive structure or do they
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
not it's it's only fair to let them make
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
that decision follow follow up thank you
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
but um the commercial industrial the
 
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
little mom and pop shops that may be in
 
02:36:42.349 --> 02:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
in town aren't voters so how would they
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
make how would they contribute to that
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
decision they they're paying property
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
tax but they're not voters in the
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
community so I I think that's you know
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
property tax right there there's there's
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
nowhere in our system and I would never
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
say that there should be anywhere in our
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
system where businesses can vote um I
 
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be vly against that so I don't
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
know if that's what you're trying to say
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
but it's it's already the case that
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in general individual people
 
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
vote on taxes that then impact
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
businesses that's just some of those
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
people who live in those towns are those
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
business owners and they have a right
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
just like every other person in that
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
town to vote for or against a different
 
02:37:19.399 --> 02:37:20.389 align:start position:0%
town to vote for or against a different
tax

02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
structure okay thank you any other
 
02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:30.990 align:start position:0%
structure okay thank you any other
question

02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
yes this is a very polite
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:37:37.150 --> 02:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
02:37:39.870 --> 02:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
question um I love a bill that that
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
challenges the thought and this and this
 
02:37:43.389 --> 02:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
definitely does and I think your
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment although I haven't studied IT
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
addresses several of my questions but
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
one I don't one I think it creates is in
 
02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:52.110 align:start position:0%
one I don't one I think it creates is in
line

02:37:52.110 --> 02:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
15 section three line 15 you say when
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the median assessed
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
value it shall be assessed for the
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
previous calendar year and this may be
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
just an opportunity for an amendment or
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
it may be a a defect whatever it is I I
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
just question that we don't do in
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
Northampton we don't do assessments
 
02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
every year we do them according to the
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
every five years or in our case every
 
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
four years that we do them except for
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
the pickups is that an is that
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
intentional to do a calendar year or is
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
that an opportunity to just tweak this a
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
little bit what this is and specifically
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
that the reason and so I I am under the
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
understanding Municipal Association sent
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
a letter and they were concerned about
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
some of the vagueness in the bill um and
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses all of their
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
concerns um they they specifically
 
02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out what do you mean assessment
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
is it the value of the previous month or
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
is it the B value of the last 10 years
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm saying whatever the assessed
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
value was the previous year it's not
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
that you have to assess it every year
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
but wherever it was at in the last
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
calendar year is the number that you use
 
02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does that answer question
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Mr chair um and
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative um I I'm from NASA I'm
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
also a an alderman in in nashwa as well
 
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
um and I I have to admit that anytime I
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
hear about additional exemptions
 
02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
additional credits my stomach goes into
 
02:39:31.870 --> 02:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
a knot because I know exactly the people
 
02:39:33.550 --> 02:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
that are going to be affected by and
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's the average citizen within the
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
city of Nashville now you keep talking
 
02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
about towns I see this happening to
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
towns and to cities and in cities the
 
02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
people do not vote for the the I didn't
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
know if you're aware of that they do not
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
vote for the the tax levels Etc um the
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
the alderman set the budget and the Dr
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
with the two other people set the tax
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
rate for the city
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
um are you m Mr chair if I may may ask
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
this question and um with another
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
followup are you aware of the the
 
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
current credits and exemptions for
 
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
Veterans for disabled for seniors for
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
blind for
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
um and are you aware of the cities that
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
give very large um deductions as it is
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
and nashille is truly just about the top
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
including over Manchester when it comes
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
to Veterans credits and so on I am aware
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
of the many municipalities that have
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
veterans disabled people a whole bunch
 
02:40:39.309 --> 02:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
of different exemptions uh I believe for
 
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
most municipalities there is a an income
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
threshold that you have to be under to
 
02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
qualify for them those this essentially
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
replaces that so it this doesn't add to
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
it I mean it adds to it in the sense
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
that it extends it to everybody
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of what their previous
 
02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
occupation was or what their particular
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
health concerns are it extends it to
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
everybody who is in that same income
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
level that you're talking about and so
 
02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
when you talk about affecting the
 
02:41:06.990 --> 02:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
average people it is that's exactly who
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to help in this is helping
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
the average people so instead of only
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
helping people based on previous
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
occupation or particular health concerns
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're helping everybody who's in that
 
02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
income uh the average working class
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
person who's in that income level who
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
just wants to own a home and contribute
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
to that municipality I am also aware and
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
I apologize for glossing over it that
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
cities don't directly vote on those tax
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
rates and of course we have this
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative system that we're all
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with that we vote for people
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
who are supposed to represent our
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
interests and so supposedly we we are
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
being represented through that um I
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
can't say speak to any particular city
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not the PE the will of
 
02:41:46.269 --> 02:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
the people's action being represented in
 
02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
any particular tax level but I am aware
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
of that so thank you I have a yes um I
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to word this so as not to
 
02:41:59.309 --> 02:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
to feel contentious because I believe in
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
in doing as much as we possibly can and
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
including to the point where Nash put in
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
inclusion area zoning which is not just
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
for rental it is for the sales of of
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
homes and so on um from multi multiple
 
02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
units not single anything greater than
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
10 um but having said that um
 
02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
the I I saw what your your
 
02:42:28.349 --> 02:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
your chart showed but when you're
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a larger City such as
 
02:42:35.550 --> 02:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um nashwa there would be
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
a a great impact on the
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
current uh makeup of those particular
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
residents would you not age read that
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
this could be quite the burden on some
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
that have already you made a comment
 
02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
about $10,000 of taxes would only be
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
$800 and the example you gave I know
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
people who whose homes aren't all that
 
02:43:03.389 --> 02:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
um expensive that are already paying
 
02:43:03.399 --> 02:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
um expensive that are already paying
over

02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:43:07.469 --> 02:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
$10,000 and are over
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
$350,000 home so they would not fit
 
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
within that
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
$800 they can't afford a $56 every
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
single week do you not feel that that
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be a burden to these people well
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
again this is meant to help the people
 
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
at at the you know the middle and under
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about someone who
 
02:43:30.429 --> 02:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
has an above average home especially in
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
this market should be relatively easy to
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
to downsize but aside from that I mean
 
02:43:38.349 --> 02:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
the great thing about this is that if
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work for any particular
 
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
municipality whether it's the city of
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
nasua and you all as Alderman already
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
feel like you're doing enough and and
 
02:43:47.469 --> 02:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
you got the right housing balance worked
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
out in NASA and you've already got it
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
and you don't need anything else you do
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
not have to adopt this this is only
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
allowing this for towns that decide that
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
this is something that will help them
 
02:43:58.750 --> 02:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
because right now as we all know we're
 
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
in a Dyan R State they are not allowed
 
02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
to do anything unless we enable them
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
this allows them to adopt instead of a
 
02:44:08.750 --> 02:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
on siiz fits-all tax it allows them to
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
adopt a tax structure that isn't
 
02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
regressive thank
 
02:44:12.399 --> 02:44:14.190 align:start position:0%
regressive thank
you

02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:18.030 align:start position:0%
you
question

02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask a question
 
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm looking at your
 
02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm looking at your
Amendment

02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm looking at the section in
 
02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
lines 21 and
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
22 any municipality that adopts a
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
homestead exe exemption under this
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
section May limit eligibility for the ex
 
02:44:47.790 --> 02:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
exemption to not Les than 10 years what
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
happens if this passes under this scheme
 
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
if in year three the person who's
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
claiming this exemption has a
 
02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.590 align:start position:0%
claiming this exemption has a
skyrocketing

02:44:58.590 --> 02:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
income what happen oh they don't call
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's a year toe qualification it doesn't
 
02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:03.870 align:start position:0%
it's a year toe qualification it doesn't
say

02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
that it's all the numbers that it's
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
based on are literally the the previous
 
02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
year's numbers so and you get taxed
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
every year right you you get you pay
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
property tax every year so that tax bill
 
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
which you have to apply for the
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
exemption right it's not automatic you
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
apply for the exemption through showing
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
your qualifications that year when you
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
get your bill then you get that
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
exemption so you have to show the
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
previous year's income the previous
 
02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the level of your assessment
 
02:45:34.389 --> 02:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
was for the previous year to qualify for
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
that Year's exemption so we all pay well
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%

02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have legislation that calls
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
out cities will do this means any of
 
02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
them they're all in and and I use the
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
word municipality as an umbrella term
 
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
that includes cities towns Villages I
 
02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
have you know I don't have an sb2 town I
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
have a Town Council town it's versus a
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
traditional Town there's all sorts of
 
02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
different delineations and I just use
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
I want to follow up on representative
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
R's question about commercial properties
 
02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and Industrial properties paying
 
02:46:54.670 --> 02:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
more tax to cover these kind of things
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't those businesses leave to a
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
smaller town that has less of a
 
02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
burden to another town that has less of
 
02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
that would be putting less of a burden
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
on them to to match the budget that the
 
02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
town has to come up well it's I mean
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually the case we already have
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
now every town has a different taxation
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
level so there are towns that may look
 
02:47:23.950 --> 02:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
more attractive a few dollars this way
 
02:47:26.030 --> 02:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
or that way I mean everybody's around
 
02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
the 20s like you know mid 20 20s to mid
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
20s uh per thousand level but it's the
 
02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
situation you have now where the people
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
of a town vote on what they want their
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
tax rate to be they understand that if
 
02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
they increase it it increases their own
 
02:47:45.070 --> 02:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
taxes it may you know be not is
 
02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
attractive to businesses in their town
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
they understand that but they also
 
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
understand the benefits that they get
 
02:47:53.309 --> 02:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
when they increase their taxes too so
 
02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
every taxpayer that votes in their town
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I understand that cities don't
 
02:48:00.510 --> 02:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
directly vote um votes based on those
 
02:48:02.269 --> 02:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
issues and what they think the proper
 
02:48:02.279 --> 02:48:04.510 align:start position:0%
issues and what they think the proper
balance

02:48:04.510 --> 02:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
is but I think it's up to the it's up to
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
the voters to decide that
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
followup well as a followup um I live an
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
exor and is almost
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
million and or million whatever the
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
billion is um and we we give back uh
 
02:48:29.950 --> 02:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
over $4 million in in tax exemptions
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh V credits etc etc that has to be made
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
up by all the other taxpayers so we've
 
02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
seen this kind
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
of Homestead question before and I I
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
just have to keep
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
asking pay the the amount of money that
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
we have to pay for our infrastructure if
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
we're giving half of the half of the
 
02:48:53.950 --> 02:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
valuation back
 
02:48:58.349 --> 02:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
to I understand that as I as I shown in
 
02:49:00.349 --> 02:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
the graph and in the chart the other
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
half the other half and that's that's
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the decision that's the value judgment
 
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
that voters in a town have to make and
 
02:49:08.910 --> 02:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
they make it every time they vote on any
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
tax property tax increase or program in
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
their own town um but what we're talking
 
02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
about is not multiples of dollars on the
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
thousand we're talking about like I said
 
02:49:23.469 --> 02:49:23.479 align:start position:0%
the difference between $100 and $108 and
 
02:49:25.150 --> 02:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
is it worth it to the people of that
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
town and they have to make that decision
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
for themselves to go okay we're going to
 
02:49:32.110 --> 02:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
pay a little bit more so that these
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
people can own homes and improve our
 
02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.429 align:start position:0%
people can own homes and improve our

02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%

questiones
 
02:49:40.990 --> 02:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
yeses thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and your
 
02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
excitement about about the situation of
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
housing which we
 
02:49:51.630 --> 02:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
all are concerned about I'd like to just
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
say that I one thing I like about the
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill is it's
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
enabling but would you believe that I'm
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
a selectman in a small town about 10,000
 
02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
people and I would never dare go before
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
them and ask them to accept this
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
concept because and we go before the
 
02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
town every year it's com up in March and
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
would you believe that we have to ask
 
02:50:23.309 --> 02:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
them for monies for certain things um
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school or a renovation or
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
what and it's not an easy sell and this
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
isn't something that uh we would be able
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
to sell and I don't want to shoot you
 
02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
down because maybe there are communities
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
but I don't know where you're going to
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
find any communities in New Hampshire
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
that would pick up this concept and and
 
02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
agree to uh go forward with it sorry to
 
02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
say that but I think it's only fair no
 
02:50:52.910 --> 02:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I guess then that means there's no
 
02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
risk to passing it if nobody's going to
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
pass it on the town level then there's
 
02:51:00.229 --> 02:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
no risk to passing it uh the the
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
question was would you believe and the
 
02:51:04.349 --> 02:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
answer is yes I believe that I believe
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
every member on this committee is either
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
a a select board member or an alderman
 
02:51:12.510 --> 02:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh local government level
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess I would say would believe
 
02:51:17.469 --> 02:51:17.479 align:start position:0%
that I understand that a new idea put
 
02:51:18.910 --> 02:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
before a whole bunch of
 
02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
aldermen is is going to have a tough
 
02:51:23.110 --> 02:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
time but I I go back to my original
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
point I get it's a new idea I get It's
 
02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
Like A New Concept and it's you know
 
02:51:29.389 --> 02:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's before a bunch of people who are
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
hesitant to adopt something new and
 
02:51:34.910 --> 02:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
different but what we are already doing
 
02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
is not working so we have to try
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
something different and I'm happy for it
 
02:51:43.309 --> 02:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
to be something else as long as the only
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
things I've said is as long as it gets
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
tax relief to the people who need it
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
most that's it is there another question
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
re yes
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh my first question
 
02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
is uh on lines uh 18 through 20 of the
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
dra of the uh
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment the what do
 
02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:23.110 align:start position:0%
Amendment the what do
you

02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
believe the local governing body would
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
use as the basis for estimating the
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
medium household income of the
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you and I mean I'm
 
02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
glad you brought this up because it is
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
me specifically giving that wiggle room
 
02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
to select boards in in Alderman across
 
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
the state is my nod to say yes you you
 
02:52:48.990 --> 02:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
have an ability to kind of uh control
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
this even if it's voted in and you
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have to recommend it
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
right it only needs to go to the the
 
02:52:56.429 --> 02:52:56.439 align:start position:0%
town warrant it doesn't need to go with
 
02:52:58.269 --> 02:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
a recommendation but to answer your
 
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
question um you can do a Google Search
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
and and find uh an answer to your uh
 
02:53:07.389 --> 02:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
your town average income most of the
 
02:53:09.469 --> 02:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
time you can get that from the IRS the
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
reason again I had the conversation with
 
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
Dr they said it the IRS is not guarant
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
to necessarily honor any requests from
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
towns for what their average income is
 
02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
but certainly uh if you do an internet
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
research you will find a number of very
 
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
reputable sources that will give you
 
02:53:28.349 --> 02:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
Town average household

instead of a Shia is that intentional
 
02:53:53.469 --> 02:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
also it is intentional it is up to the
 
02:53:56.269 --> 02:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
town uh whether or not they put a limit
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
on the exemption to say no one can claim
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years of this exemption um
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
or and they can they can limit it to 20
 
02:54:07.229 --> 02:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
years or 15 years or whatever but they
 
02:54:09.309 --> 02:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
can't if they want to limit it they have
 
02:54:12.030 --> 02:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
to at least give it for 10
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
years thank you represent
 
02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:54:18.910 --> 02:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a relatively
 
02:54:22.750 --> 02:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
simple one um I would like to know
 
02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation requires what is it
 
02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.229 --> 02:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
you excuse me any other questions are
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
speaking representative gu turn your
 
02:54:50.590 --> 02:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
ahead representative
 
02:54:55.469 --> 02:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
CLE thank you Mr chair and um I just
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
have one really quick question you made
 
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
a comment earlier that um this to enable
 
02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
something like this we would kind of
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
more or less get rid of all the other
 
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
ones the seniors the disability and so
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
on but would it get rid of the
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
veterans do it doesn't get adds
 
02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
exemption it doesn't take away any
 
02:55:13.710 --> 02:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions but you're not getting double
 
02:55:15.870 --> 02:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions right like so they're not you
 
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
can only be exempt once so it's not like
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
either just just a quick followup um
 
02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
just more of a of a statement um
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
veterans do not meet a threshold they
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
just meet um a service connection um so
 
02:55:36.030 --> 02:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
therefore like a surviving spouse um tax
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
credit for Nasha would be
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
$2,000 um a
 
02:55:46.229 --> 02:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
AES reform okay so I guess I guess my my
 
02:55:48.910 --> 02:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
qu my question is just that with your
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
enabling they would still be entitled to
 
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
the credit even if their um the value of
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
their home their assess value went down
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
they're still entitled to their veteran
 
02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
credit unless the town decides that hey
 
02:56:05.150 --> 02:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
we've just given this massive exemption
 
02:56:07.349 --> 02:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
to everybody who needs it and then
 
02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
veterans who are doing very well for
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
themselves don't need it and that town
 
02:56:13.630 --> 02:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
decides to repeal that credit but that's
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
completely up to the town and this bill
 
02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch veterans credits
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
represent any other questions for the
 
02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
very much it's a long
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
topic uh we also have uh ready to to
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
nhma

02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.269 --> 02:56:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is I'm Nate GRA
 
02:56:53.790 --> 02:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
Association um I was just handed the
 
02:56:58.750 --> 02:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so I haven't uh had a chance
 
02:57:01.469 --> 02:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
to to read that or look at how IT
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
addresses any concerns that we uh that
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
we outlined in our letter that was
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee earlier this
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
week um as written
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I will just say um briefly
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that our concerns
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
were all about implementation we we
 
02:57:25.389 --> 02:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
don't uh really oppose any sort of local
 
02:57:28.830 --> 02:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
options um but in terms of implementing
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
and how this would actually function and
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
its relationship to other tax credits um
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
were our our major concerns and I'm
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee members may have the committee
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:47.439 --> 02:57:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.670 --> 02:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question I
 
02:57:58.030 --> 02:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
applaud the goal of
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
this but it seems very convoluted and
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
complicated do you see it that way from
 
02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal standpoint I I agree um
 
02:58:13.070 --> 02:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
because at least in the initial bill the
 
02:58:14.590 --> 02:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
the term
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
typical wasn't defined as to whether
 
02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
that meant mean or median in terms of
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
things like the typical assessed value
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
or typical household income um but even
 
02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that you could assign that uh
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
it seems difficult to implement it just
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the rapidly changing
 
02:58:43.950 --> 02:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
um uh residential Market as well as um
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
when you have instances of someone who
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
would qualify under the definitions but
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
then you know they qualified because
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
currently they are in a job training
 
02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
program or a university or something and
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
then they get their degree and they get
 
02:59:00.990 --> 02:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
the job that makes them a lot of money
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and therefore they no longer qualify
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
at what point do you of end the credit
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
for them and how does that work with the
 
02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
tax cycle wasn't clearly defined within
 
02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any other questions from
 
02:59:14.160 --> 02:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any other questions from
the

02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%

02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%

1387 appreciate your patience this was a
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
long hearing uh so right now we're gonna
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%

02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
o'clock Mr chairman yes my father was a
 
02:59:45.710 --> 02:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
butcher and and whenever he was
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
butchering pork or beef they hung the
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
the carcasses in a very cold
 
02:59:58.110 --> 02:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
room and I'm sitting here my teeth are
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
chattering and I have gloves on because
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
I don't have good circulation and I'm
 
03:00:05.950 --> 03:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we could build a
 
03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
bonfire or
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
something yeah we've had some
 
03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions I understand that some of
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
you are a little chilly in the room that
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
my request to change the temperature was
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
shut down with the fact that this is now
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
a centrally controll system that local
 
03:00:27.229 --> 03:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh controls no longer I see people with
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
their winter coats on it I thought you
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%

03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:34.680 align:start position:0%

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%

a job to do like for the first time in
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
my uh County we finally have a drug
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit we finally have
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
involved in school shooting you know
 
04:04:00.630 --> 04:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
practices and things like that the
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
sheriff's we F we have a county attorney
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's involved in many cases and some
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
of them drag on the year two years uh
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
they're involved they're hiring they're
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
getting their counties up and running so
 
04:04:17.309 --> 04:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
the counties should never ever be like
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
us as legislators or the governor or US
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
Congress or Senators because we all get
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
elected to make the laws um the
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer the same thing you know a
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
two-year job uh you know then why are
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
they wasting their time running for
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
re-election raising funds I don't know
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
how many times a sheriff asked re with
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
money I I just keep telling the check's
 
04:04:42.750 --> 04:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
in the mail you know what I mean but he
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
he should be doing that the third year
 
04:04:46.110 --> 04:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
or something after you know three years
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
of getting the sheriff uh organization
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
up and running and doing like he's been
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing finally in many years I've never
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
seen as many Sheriff cars out on the
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
highways now that you know doing a job
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
so they should be able to continue and
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
run for reelection every four years
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
which gives them enough time okay to get
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
the job done
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
this way here they're not looking for
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
money while they're trying to do a job
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
as a sheriff or a county attorney or a
 
04:05:16.990 --> 04:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer or anything on the counties
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
and that's basically where I'm stand
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's about time we try
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
to fix this here you know and this
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
benefits all of us Republicans and
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
Democrats and I think this should have
 
04:05:28.030 --> 04:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
been a nonpartisan bill but I know it
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
was one of them bills that got was
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
rushed because the last one I guess got
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
table or something happen and that's all
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
I have and I'll answer any
 
04:05:36.880 --> 04:05:39.830 align:start position:0%
I have and I'll answer any
questions

04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
right representative okay thank you
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative bazaro my question is if
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh why is this bill just focusing on
 
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and not all the
 
04:05:53.070 --> 04:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire I I honestly
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
think it should be all the counties but
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Representatives took
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
the initiative uh your chairman and um
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas to put this in and
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
talk with the county and get there you
 
04:06:05.710 --> 04:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
know and they supported it and was
 
04:06:07.630 --> 04:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
pushing it but I think you got a great
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
question question it should be all maybe
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment could be done and do the whole
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
state because it's a
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.800 --> 04:06:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%

1397 now although my position is elected
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
the functions of my position are
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely administrative in in
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
nature I have long believed candidates
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
for this position should be required to
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
possess knowledge of real estate
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
interests knowledge of significant
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements and possess
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
possess strong supervisory skills and
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
understand the budget process as you
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
know the only requirement is to live in
 
04:07:44.239 --> 04:07:44.990 align:start position:0%
know the only requirement is to live in
the

04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
County elected County positions
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
territories Encompass vast numbers of
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
towns and cities requiring significant
 
04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
time spent campaing we do not draft nor
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
vote on legislation we administer our
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
offices unfortunately even with the
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
enormous effort placed on meeting and
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
attempting to educate the public about
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
our positions if you ask many voters
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
about County positions they have no idea
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
what we do and that's really
 
04:08:15.630 --> 04:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate the current election cycle
 
04:08:17.469 --> 04:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
scheme results in the official having
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
little over a year to focus on
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
objectives of the office with the
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
remaining time spent balancing office
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
oversight with a necessity to campaign
 
04:08:26.479 --> 04:08:27.429 align:start position:0%
oversight with a necessity to campaign
for

04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
re-election it would be beneficial to
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
citizens to have more consistency in the
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
administration of the offices by
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
extending the term from two years to
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
four years this would enable the elected
 
04:08:41.389 --> 04:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
official more time for long range
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
planning research and implementation of
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
new processes to keep the respective
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
offices up to date with current
 
04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
trends as you know County Commissioners
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
enjoy a fouryear floating term and the
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
reason for that was for consistency in
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
the office because they run the county
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
all the other Departments of the county
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
so ensure that there's somebody there
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
who has some type of knowledge that's
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's already in in
 
04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
statute I'd like to share with you that
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
the challenges in 2020 and 2021 brought
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the Forefront The increased
 
04:09:14.590 --> 04:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
importance of focusing on daily
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
functions of my and the sheriff's
 
04:09:17.760 --> 04:09:18.990 align:start position:0%
functions of my and the sheriff's
essential

04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
essential
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
offices you know we had to remain open
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
my office for Real Estate activity
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
because if we didn't what would happen
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the state would not be a very
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
good thing now I'll share with you that
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
50% of my staff was out for an extended
 
04:09:35.070 --> 04:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
period of time during covid so I only
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
had 50% and we have seen incredible
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
increases in real estate activity
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
especially in Rockingham County I'll
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
share with you that I turned over
 
04:09:43.880 --> 04:09:45.550 align:start position:0%
share with you that I turned over
[Music]

04:09:45.550 --> 04:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
6,645 th000 last year to the state of
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and another 5.6 million to
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County my office is big
 
04:09:57.109 --> 04:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
business and you need somebody in there
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
who is consistent and knows how to run
 
04:09:58.960 --> 04:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
who is consistent and knows how to run
the

04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
department the state campaigning or the
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
election during this past year was
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
challenging is to say it is an
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
understatement whether this year or
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
another election cycle the reality is it
 
04:10:13.229 --> 04:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
is a distraction and I have an important
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
job to do a job that requires my full
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
attention it is a distraction not only
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the elected official but also the
 
04:10:25.950 --> 04:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
public and my staff by anually staff are
 
04:10:27.630 --> 04:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
expected to remain focused on the task
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
at hand but the reality is they fear the
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
unknown when it comes to elections the
 
04:10:36.030 --> 04:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
what ifs can be debilitating staff asked
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
questions about Facebook posting
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
newspaper reports and become quite upset
 
04:10:43.149 --> 04:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
when opponents come to our offices to
 
04:10:43.159 --> 04:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
when opponents come to our offices to
introduce

04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
themselves you know our staffs are the
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
backbone of our offices absolutely
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly you know I I and I can't
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
stress enough how important it is for
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
any of us to have staff that are true
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
and loyal and want to stay in the job we
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
have enough problems right now trying to
 
04:11:01.189 --> 04:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
keep staff just because of the
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances with covid I have three
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
openings that I have not been able to
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
fill in the last three years we cannot
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
get people to come and if we do they
 
04:11:10.560 --> 04:11:11.389 align:start position:0%
get people to come and if we do they
don't

04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
stay you
 
04:11:18.269 --> 04:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
know in the long run obviously you know
 
04:11:20.109 --> 04:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
as an elected official I know I have to
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
run I understand that I do it I enjoy
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
running for for election I I won't I
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
won't lie about it but it is a huge
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
distraction because the minute you get
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
elected know you may be working for
 
04:11:33.070 --> 04:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
maybe about a year and then you start
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about gearing up because you
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
have to gear up I have 37 towns in
 
04:11:39.550 --> 04:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
cities in my County that's a lot it's a
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
it's a big and it's a very wide area so
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
the final point I'll share is my
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
personal disappointments with election
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
results because historically if you look
 
04:11:50.830 --> 04:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
at the ballots in any of these County
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
races you will find that people it's
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
like we fall off the ballot people don't
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
vote for the people at the bottom of the
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
ballot which are the county officials
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
and that's sad you know in closing I you
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
know again I ask that you support House
 
04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 1397 I did provide to you because
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
last year when when this was heard there
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion during the uh
 
04:12:15.630 --> 04:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
executive session with regards to you
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
know we if we give people a four-year
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
term we can't get them out of office and
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's not true because there is a
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism if somebody is not performing
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
the functions properly of their job
 
04:12:27.109 --> 04:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
there is an RSA that allows the County
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
delegation to get rid of them so you
 
04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
know I just want to point that out to
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
you so I I thank you very much for that
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to end that testimony but then
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop my new testimony so Mr
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee Kathy
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
Stacy I'm the legislative chair for the
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties a
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
position I've held for the last I
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
believe six years so this past week you
 
04:12:57.149 --> 04:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
know obviously we track all legislation
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect County government
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
this past week our executive board met
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read a letter from the
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
association of counties dear chairman d
 
04:13:08.349 --> 04:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal and County
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
government committee the New Hampshire
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
Association of counties would like to
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
register its support for House Bill 1397
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the length of terms for
 
04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County of officers this bill
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
would increase the term length for the
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County's treasur Sheriff
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
register deeds and County attorney to
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
four years this would increase stability
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the elected offices for some of the
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
County's most important functions these
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
offices serve as part of the backbone of
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
County government New Hampshire and
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
reducing turnover in these positions
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
will allow for more long-term planning
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
and decision- making the association ask
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
for your support for House Bill
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
1397 and if you have any questions you
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
can address them to me or to Kate Horan
 
04:13:51.630 --> 04:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
who is our uh executive
 
04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
director thank
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
you testimony please uh would you accept
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay so um I was just
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
looking up the uh previous bill because
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
this was all sounding very familiar to
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
me um it was HB 560 right that um we
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
voted on previously about that and that
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
passed this committee didn't it what do
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
you know what happened to it after that
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
why are we having to it got laid on the
 
04:14:29.309 --> 04:14:29.319 align:start position:0%
table uh at what at what stage that I
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you all I all I can tell
 
04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
you was that one of the problems last
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
time was that the sponsor was the finan
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
chair couldn't come and speak in behalf
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill and um I think that at your
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
executive committee I don't know that it
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
P I don't know that it came out of the
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure that it did I was
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
my um so yeah my or I was just checking
 
04:15:10.030 --> 04:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
my own notes that said it um passed by a
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
vote of 11 to8 um and there's an
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to it that passed
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously so I was
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explain the
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between our memories
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
here I I don't understand the question
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
well you you were saying you thought you
 
04:15:31.710 --> 04:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
you were saying you thought didn't come
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
out of this committee I don't know
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:50.269 align:start position:0%
out of this committee I don't know
it's

04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um I'm going to
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
ask the the same question that
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative rung asked of a uh the
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker um would the
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
association do you think would be um in
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
favor of all of the uh counties going
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
with years versus just or have they not
 
04:16:10.600 --> 04:16:11.710 align:start position:0%
with years versus just or have they not
discussed

04:16:11.710 --> 04:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
this I no we really didn't discuss it I
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
know that the understanding was they
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
thought that this was going to be a
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
pilot to see how it worked in Rockingham
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
County and then go forward um and other
 
04:16:23.469 --> 04:16:23.479 align:start position:0%
than that I really can't comment because
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's the executive committee all the
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
members that you know vote and this is
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
this is what came out of that meeting
 
04:16:31.630 --> 04:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
was for support for Rockingham County
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
follow up just for
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
clarity okay so just so that I I'm I'm
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
clear you're you we're looking towards
 
04:16:41.309 --> 04:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
it being a a pilot to see how it work do
 
04:16:44.189 --> 04:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
you feel that if this did work you would
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to go forward with the other
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
counties absolutely okay thank you very
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you very much uh just a
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
quick couple questions Cathy uh in the
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
delegation we set the salary for those
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
elected officials how would that work
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
with a four-year term would
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
you you know obviously the delegation to
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
choose to do what they want years past I
 
04:17:11.189 --> 04:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
can tell you that Mart County used to
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
put their elected officials on a pay it
 
04:17:14.950 --> 04:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
would be like a pay scale just like they
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
do with regular employees so they would
 
04:17:19.710 --> 04:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
move along that was what they did you
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
know so they set it always has to be set
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
before the sign up period and then it's
 
04:17:26.429 --> 04:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
for the term whatever whatever gets done
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
is for the
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
question excuse me it says that it's
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
going to pass uh within 60 days if this
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
did pass say it's in June it's after the
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
filing period I think for those
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
positions so how would that
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
it that I I I couldn't tell you I mean
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it pass in 60 days I
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
mean I would hope it would be before the
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
sign up period but if it was after I
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know that you could just
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
say it's it's in effect and then people
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
who signed up because it wouldn't give
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for anybody else who
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
me so it talks about the general at the
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
2022 state general election and at each
 
04:18:28.109 --> 04:18:28.119 align:start position:0%
general election thereafter will be
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
fouryear term so it says that this would
 
04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
affect the 20 whe regardless of what the
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
timing is of the 60 days section
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
five says that it would be effective for
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
the 2022 state general
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh for taking my question
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
a question is you mentioned that this is
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
going to be considered a pilot program
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
before it's recommended for other
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
counties um has your Association
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
developed any criteria for evaluating
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
that pilot project what would be some
 
04:19:13.109 --> 04:19:13.119 align:start position:0%
metrics you'd want to achieve in order
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
to make that recommendation I don't know
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
that it was our understanding of the
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that was put in was It was
 
04:19:23.309 --> 04:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a testing or a pilot for
 
04:19:25.469 --> 04:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
just Rockingham County that's something
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
that Mr Dolan that was the discussion
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
with Mr Dolan not certainly with the
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
association of counties the association
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
counties did not put this bill in we are
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
just supporting the
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you so the municipal the
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
the association of counties then but you
 
04:19:47.790 --> 04:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're is it a formalized pilot
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
project that no no okay all right thank
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.560 --> 04:20:09.269 align:start position:0%
 
not

04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here I'm just
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to say as a co-sponsor I totally
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
support the bill and the speakers
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
previously behind me I also know that
 
04:20:20.109 --> 04:20:20.119 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the Bill of
 
04:20:23.070 --> 04:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Dolan uh didn't in fact
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
mean all of the County uh elected
 
04:20:28.030 --> 04:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
officials in in his statement uh
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
obviously uh we want to apply to uh to
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
all of those I also want to say that um
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh I in the the year years I've been
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
there out campaigning I see the county
 
04:20:42.990 --> 04:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
people uh scurrying back and forth from
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee meetings to to events to
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
Coffee breaks and where they meet people
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
it takes away from their time and I
 
04:20:53.590 --> 04:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
really think that the uh the four-year
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um uh period is a good way for them to
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
actually get in uh you know do their job
 
04:21:00.269 --> 04:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
that they were intended to do they're
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
they're not like us you know they're not
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
like the federal employees they they
 
04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
have jobs to do so I fully support this
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
bill I also think that in in the recent
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
cases the costs of campaigning have have
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
really skyrocketed and this you know
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
adds to their costs as well and they're
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
not paid to campaign they're they're
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
paid to run the you know County as for
 
04:21:24.750 --> 04:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of other counties doing this um
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's a it's a good idea
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
but I will say I won't speak for other
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
counties I think this is what Rockham
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
County would like to do if other
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
counties would like to follow a suit
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
they can certainly chime in or or uh uh
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
do what they want but but I I don't
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
speak for other counties so with that
 
04:21:44.189 --> 04:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
said um I thank you for your time and
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh I don't sure if there's one or
 
04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
two but I think A lot's been say here so
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
very good thank you um I like to start
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
out by saying saying i' I'd rather have
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
my my comments here as a discussion
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
rather than as testimony I'll certainly
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
take questions during any time uh anyone
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
wishes uh I believe that uh that
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
develops a conversation much better uh
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here today with basically with two
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
hats on over the last couple of days I
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
spoke with the other County attorneys
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state either by video uh
 
04:23:04.030 --> 04:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
or by uh email and I can tell you that
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
the uh that the County's attorneys
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
across the state 100% of us uh would
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
would wish an amendment would uh would
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
issue on this legislation to include
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
County attorneys throughout the entire
 
04:23:22.109 --> 04:23:22.119 align:start position:0%
State uh we all believe that um that we
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a job that's
 
04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
unique uh and it involves a great deal
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
of trust over a broad range and when I
 
04:23:29.199 --> 04:23:30.030 align:start position:0%
of trust over a broad range and when I
say

04:23:30.030 --> 04:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
that I mean we have to deal with dozens
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
and dozens of police departments many
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
many courts
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
and developing a working relationship in
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
a trust as County attorney takes time
 
04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
within those
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
organizations um and uh the individuals
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
within the uh the multiple counties when
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the County attorneys
 
04:23:51.550 --> 04:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan approach if you
 
04:23:53.950 --> 04:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to look at it as a partisan issue
 
04:23:55.950 --> 04:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
um both Democrats and Republican County
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
attorneys agree 100% that allow to apply
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
for for everybody uh Sheriff's County
 
04:24:02.670 --> 04:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys across the state for
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
continuity reasons it would make sense
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
for it to also apply to other count
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
officials um but we do not um speak for
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
the other County uh County officials my
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I think it ought to
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
apply for Sheriff's County attorneys and
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
all elected County officials for a
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
four-year term um I mentioned um the
 
04:24:27.109 --> 04:24:27.119 align:start position:0%
unique relationships that we have with
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
the courts and with the police
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
departments we have to establish that
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
relationship to set a tone and a tenor
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
of prosecution within the county uh we
 
04:24:38.670 --> 04:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
have to have a continuity of operations
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
and a continuity uh of process uh that
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
exists between the many many departments
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we that we represent and that we
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
prosecute for in Marat County I
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
prosecute for over 30 police departments
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
when we add them all all up uh state
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
agencies local agencies fishing game uh
 
04:24:58.389 --> 04:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
when you add them all up it's over 30 of
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
them uh it's very difficult for a city
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and county attorney in two years to
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
develop the relationships that they need
 
04:25:09.149 --> 04:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
to effectively um um interact with every
 
04:25:10.590 --> 04:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
single one of those 30 police
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
departments marac county is a th000
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
square miles uh at its peak during the
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
day probably has 200,000 people in it
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to interact with
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
those individuals in a rapid manner over
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
the course of a two-year period only to
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
start again the next couple years
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the election side of things
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
long range
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
planning uh I can only speak from from
 
04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
somebody planning that I've done in
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
Marat County uh
 
04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
I've tried over the last 12 months to
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
put together um what I'm trying to
 
04:25:43.149 --> 04:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish with the police departments
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
of doing internal training to make uh uh
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
to give them training within our office
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
by attorneys so they can do their job
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
better it takes a long time to to
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
generate um the approach to that the
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
space for that uh to coordinate with the
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh with the chiefs of police uh and
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's doubly important from my
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
viewpoint as Marat County attorney
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
because the police departments now are
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
going from I believe it's going from 12
 
04:26:13.389 --> 04:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
to 24 and going to 40 hours of training
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
time on an annual basis well I hope to
 
04:26:19.870 --> 04:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
to do some of that within my office uh
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
and alleviate some of the burden on some
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the police departments especially to
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
smaller police departments when you're
 
04:26:25.830 --> 04:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
talking two and three person police
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
departments relieving them of some of
 
04:26:30.189 --> 04:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
the burden of cost of training uh is a
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
big deal and that's one of the
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives that that I'm trying to
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish doing that in that two-year
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
period um with the possibility that the
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
next County attorney uh may not follow
 
04:26:43.229 --> 04:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
through with that with that organization
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
or that structure makes it very
 
04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
difficult for continuity especially
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
within the uh uh within the police
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
departments uh attorney training is
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
another issue each County attorney views
 
04:26:56.309 --> 04:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
attorney training differently uh I take
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
it quite quite seriously uh I've been
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
very lucky to uh be able to send several
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
of uh the assistant County attorneys to
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
some very good Training put on by the
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
national District Attorneys ass
 
04:27:07.950 --> 04:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
Association 100% of my attorneys are
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
members of national District Attorneys
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
Association it's very important to
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
develop those those professional ties
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
different attorneys take a different
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
view on it and I again I think there
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
it that pretty much sums up my major uh
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
points that I wanted to make I certainly
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
will will ask for welcome any questions
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and chairman Dolan
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
if you are any other member of the
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee has any other information
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
information or any one any any other
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
information you can feel free to contact
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.469 --> 04:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
good thank you um representative P Monte
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:28:07.109 --> 04:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
you so I'm really confused
 
04:28:10.750 --> 04:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
by um what's already in the law what
 
04:28:13.710 --> 04:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
that law covers and how the sections of
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
this bill fit in with with existing
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
law so as I read section
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
6531 it pertains to the entire
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
state it is not a County by count issue
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
pertains to the entire
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:37.309 align:start position:0%
pertains to the entire
state

04:28:37.309 --> 04:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
um and then it goes on to say that those
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
officials appointed under elected under
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
this law include the County
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it doesn't
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
mention attorneys registers of registers
 
04:28:54.510 --> 04:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
of Deeds so I'm just I'm hoping that
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
somebody can explain to
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
me how this fits into current existing
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
law uh how by Framing it as only
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
pertaining to Rockingham County we get
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
around the fact that
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
6531 pertains to the state as a
 
04:29:13.760 --> 04:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
6531 pertains to the state as a
whole

04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm just confused about the
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
structure I think I understand your
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
question when I'm reading the the 6331
 
04:29:28.590 --> 04:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 change um 6531 I'm sorry Roman 5
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
change that was printed out the way I
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
read this uh it talks about uh uh the
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
first sentence not in bold talks about
 
04:29:41.070 --> 04:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
which offices are affected the second
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
sentence indicates that uh that um
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2022 and at each subsequent
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
election Rockingham County is affected
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
by that four-year change when you look
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
at 733 which is above it beginning on
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
line two it talks about uh again uh the
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
County Attorney me members and then it
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
says provided that uh again in bold
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
provided that beginning in 2022 and I'm
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing the county attorney for
 
04:30:14.429 --> 04:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
Rockingham shall be voted in for a
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
four-year term so the way I read this it
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
would only apply to Rockingham County
 
04:30:21.389 --> 04:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
for the county attorney not
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide follow up if I may uh then
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
6531 uh why not make it just a bill that
 
04:30:35.950 --> 04:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
cares out Rockingham County County
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys and other County officials for
 
04:30:39.000 --> 04:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
attorneys and other County officials for
fouryear

04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
fouryear
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
terms uh I have not um 6531 Roman 5 I'll
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to defer to the to the legislature
 
04:30:50.429 --> 04:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
and your and your and the folks that
 
04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
draft your your statutes and and uh uh
 
04:30:57.149 --> 04:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
sub and and the submissions that you
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
submit only because um I don't know if
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
there's any interaction that I don't see
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
with with printed here and I'm not an
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
election law person but but I fully
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
understand my question but I understand
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
your question that if it was covered
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
under 7 colon 33 that it would apply to
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and would be and you wouldn't
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
have to do it under
 
04:31:18.269 --> 04:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
65315 yeah that and that may be true
 
04:31:19.950 --> 04:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
that may be true but without me doing a
 
04:31:23.070 --> 04:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
deep dive into the other parts of 6 uh
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
6531 I I I wouldn't want to go out on a
 
04:31:27.070 --> 04:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
limit answer that question because I
 
04:31:28.750 --> 04:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what I don't know thank you
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:31:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair um I just have a
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
really quick question um you you you
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
spoke to continuity um yes and I'm all
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
four trying to keep things on an even
 
04:31:51.790 --> 04:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
Keel um you also mentioned about things
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
going into court and so on how long on
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
average and I know you probably might
 
04:31:57.990 --> 04:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
not know this on the top of here but
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
does a court case last so for instance I
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
know you have attorneys that are
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
underneath you that are litigating those
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
but um as as the top dog so to speak you
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
would want to kind of keep control over
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of that so how long would an average
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
court case take and how often do you
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
leave things hanging if you were to
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
leave office I can tell you I just to be
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
Prov a little background for for for you
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing criminal law for
 
04:32:27.510 --> 04:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
just over 21 years and as a prosecutor
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
just over 18 19 years um I practiced in
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts and bellnap Carol uh
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
Grafton uh meramac and district courts
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
about 11 or 12 about I think uh eight
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
district courts circuit courts um so uh
 
04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'll speak generally about my experience
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
over those couple of decades misdemeanor
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
cases in the circuit courts uh violation
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
of misdemeanor cases may take three
 
04:32:53.590 --> 04:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
months they could take a year and a half
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
depending on uh on um the posture of the
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
case the court scheduling uh obviously
 
04:33:03.630 --> 04:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
I'm talking non-co issues here uh the uh
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
the uh it all depends on court on court
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
scheduling severity uh whether or not an
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
attorney changes in the middle of a
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
court proceeding so some could be fairly
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
quick some could take out take a year a
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
year and a half uh in the Superior
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
Courts some of the more serious cases
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
may may begin uh uh on day one and maybe
 
04:33:27.629 --> 04:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
go on for two two and a half years um uh
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
I can't speak again I'm speaking only
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
for cases that would that the county
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
attorney's office would handle not like
 
04:33:34.230 --> 04:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
a homicide case uh that the Attorney
 
04:33:36.029 --> 04:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
General's office would uh would uh
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
handle I can't speak for their time in
 
04:33:40.990 --> 04:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
time in court but there's quite a long
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
period of of time and remember for
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
continuity reasons too U there's a
 
04:33:47.949 --> 04:33:47.959 align:start position:0%
continuity in approach to a case because
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
even before a case is is begun um uh a
 
04:33:54.510 --> 04:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
case is filed uh with the courts there's
 
04:33:56.349 --> 04:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of leg work that happens prior to
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
that with between the police departments
 
04:34:00.029 --> 04:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
and the and the County attorneys or the
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
prosecuting attorneys I use the term
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
generally the prosecuting attorneys to
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that all the eyes are dotted
 
04:34:07.709 --> 04:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
in Te across be be before we begin an
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
adversarial proceeding against the
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
person um so I think uh when you look at
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
Soup To Nuts you have to factor in that
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
that that preliminary time that's not
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
Court time in with it and some of those
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we're talking in some cases you'll
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
easily exceed year and a half or two
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony I'm trying to get my arms
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
around uh what kind of longevity these
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
positions have what the track record is
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
are they being
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
reelected uh do you have any feel at
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
least with the County attorneys uh
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the longevity in that
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
position is the voter recognizing what
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're asking to do now to recognize that
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of a job does justify the
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
fouryear term instead of jumping in
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
every two years right right I know that
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
that some County attorne have served
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
several five six terms I'd rather not
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
mention who I'll I'll defer to them I
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
know some are in their first term such
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
as myself um you know and it's an
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
interesting question that you rais
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
because I think there's a there's a
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's a parallel analysis when you
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
look at the at the terms of service for
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
a county attorney the parallel analysis
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
would be the terms of service for a
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
police chief um and the police chief
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
term of service most police Chiefs have
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
in their their jobs for for several
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
years years it takes that amount of time
 
04:35:39.949 --> 04:35:39.959 align:start position:0%
my opinion takes that amount of time uh
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
for them to to to I don't want to use
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the term grow in in a in a in a bad
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
sense but grow into a job and develop
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
their their leadership uh style uh and
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
and the County Attorney has the same
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
thing uh I did a lot of leadership
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
positions when I was in the military I
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
did a lot of leadership positions
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
throughout life but the role was
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
different and um that first few months
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
you're you're feeling a position out
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
like any new position anyone goes goes
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
into even legislators I'm sure have to
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
feel out how they enter their their
 
04:36:13.949 --> 04:36:13.959 align:start position:0%
individual jobs um so I think the
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
continuity is there I think citizens
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes recommend sometimes recognize
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
that and and choose to elect their their
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
their County attorneys just for that
 
04:36:25.230 --> 04:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
reason and there are several County
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys I I assume more than two that
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
have been in their positions for quite a
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
long time and that the that the
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
residents realized that there was a
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
benefit to that
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
continuity would you believe that uh I
 
04:36:38.590 --> 04:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
only can talk from Rockingham
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
County you know you don't allow could I
 
04:36:49.800 --> 04:36:49.810 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:49.810 --> 04:36:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:53.439 --> 04:36:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.310 --> 04:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
understand yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:37:01.629 --> 04:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
sorry about not asking a followup but
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe I can only speak for
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County but I'm sure all these
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
positions have longevity have a history
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
of being reelected reelected yes unless
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's a an opening is very seldom so I
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
think the voters in Rockingham recognize
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that whether it's a twoyear
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
four year or sixe term they want these
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
people who are providing these kind of
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
services uh justify coming back and
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
doing their job so and I'm quite sure
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's sure in the county ATT yeah I I I
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the other counties and I
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
didn't do a deep dive into the number of
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
years individuals have been in their
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
jobs so I I couldn't comment beyond what
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
I just said thank you yes sir thank you
 
04:37:45.080 --> 04:37:49.230 align:start position:0%
I just said thank you yes sir thank you
Mr

04:37:58.830 --> 04:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon my name is Chuck
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
beses and I'm the Rockham County Sheriff

uh thank you for letting me speak to you
 
04:38:11.189 --> 04:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
today um I'm on my second term as
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
Sheriff um I took over after um my Carol
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
turned 70 years old he couldn't run for
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
Sheriff um in my three years as
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
sheriff or when I ran for a sheriff I
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
used to say that law enforcement used to
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
change every single day but law
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement changes every single minute
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
with all the LEC reform and everything
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
going on in this country um just one
 
04:38:39.551 --> 04:38:39.561 align:start position:0%
example our training this year is going
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
to 24 hours and that doesn't include the
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
extra hours we're up to over 45 hours uh
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
per year in training to keep our
 
04:38:49.949 --> 04:38:49.959 align:start position:0%
certifications as police officers I'm
 
04:38:52.349 --> 04:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
also a business owner in London in New
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been a business owner for
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
over 40 years and I've been in law
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 33
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
years when I took over Sheriff my main
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
goal was to become a community police
 
04:39:07.629 --> 04:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
organization where we work with our
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
local state and federal law enforcement
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
officers throughout the
 
04:39:15.310 --> 04:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
state my biggest passion was
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
drugs in my three years term I've taken
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
the drug unit in Rockingham County
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
through granite Shield I have 20
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
officers that this pays for their
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
overtime have enhanced our drug unit to
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
seven deputies that are in that to go
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
out and fight this Dangerous Drug that
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
affects our family F family F uh family
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
friends and and
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
friends um but it takes work as soon as
 
04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
I get elected to sheriff my first term
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
which was very expensive it cost me
 
04:39:48.030 --> 04:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
close to
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
$40,000 to run for a two-year term I'm
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
back running again with everything
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's going on with law enforcement
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on in this
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
country it's hard for me to try to keep
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
up with what I'm doing when I have to go
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
out and Camp hand again and raise money
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with the register ad
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
Deeds when it comes to County officials
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
and I think we all feel the same during
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
a presidential election we were actually
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
on the back of the ballot in Rockingham
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
County so people didn't even know that
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
they were County officials because a lot
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
of them didn't flip that ballot
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
around it takes a lot of work for what
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
we do and you know two years isn't
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
enough it you know it I've taken the
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
sheriff's off office from a good
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
position and I've I've vetted the whole
 
04:40:42.030 --> 04:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
organization where we work together with
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
our local state and local law
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and to try to
 
04:40:49.628 --> 04:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
concentrate on running a campaign every
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
two years because as soon as you get
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:41:05.520 --> 04:41:33.628 align:start position:0%
it
thank

04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%

understanding on that last bill I got
 
04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
something backwards for some from some
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
notes I had I apologize I think the
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
speakers fixed that in the discussion
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
so just more making aware of that my
 
04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%

04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to speak to

today is House Bill
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
1277 which is relative to the reping of
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.670 --> 04:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
SES uh do we have someone to introduce
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh and members
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%

04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
represented Peter ssuch uh District 7 uh
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham and WT Smith welcome thank
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
you um this bill uh result is the result
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
of a conversation I had with our it
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Dennis GLE when I asked him
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
if there's something that he thinks is
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
is of high priority in his mind that he
 
04:43:59.390 --> 04:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
thinks we should have a bill for and he
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
said currently his number one worry and
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
concern is the is issue of cyber
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
security incidents but specifically he
 
04:44:11.230 --> 04:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that one of the concerns he
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
had was that
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
currently um the many uh municipalities
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh use their computers to connect to
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
State computers for various
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
services but if those municipalities
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
encounter a cyber security incident uh a
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
hack or a A ransomware or anything like
 
04:44:35.788 --> 04:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
that they are not required to report
 
04:44:37.390 --> 04:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
this to his
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
Department which means that there could
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
be a potential for State computers to be
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
indirectly hacked or taken Ransom
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
through the connection with
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities so this bill basically
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
says that when a municipality encounters
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
these kind of problems on at their level
 
04:44:59.310 --> 04:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
if they are doing business with the
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
state which almost all of them are that
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
they are required to report this to the
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
it commissioner that's pretty much very
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
simple uh way of stating it now um in
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
the meantime I received a a letter from
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association who points out
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
that the way this bill is written
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
currently it could imply that any
 
04:45:24.510 --> 04:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
incident occurring in that municipality
 
04:45:27.150 --> 04:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
would be reportable uh and so they
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
suggested a change a small minor change
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
to the bill let me just mention that to
 
04:45:33.718 --> 04:45:35.150 align:start position:0%
to the bill let me just mention that to
you

04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
um on
 
04:45:41.948 --> 04:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
line line four and five where it
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
says um suspects a suspects a cyber
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
security incident within such political
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
subdivision uh here they're saying uh
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
the municipal Society Society uh
 
04:45:54.560 --> 04:45:55.788 align:start position:0%
the municipal Society Society uh
Municipal

04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Association uh says this could imply
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
that it's any incident within that uh
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision and it could be a private uh
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
incident with a business or a residence
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
so they suggested a minor change saying
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
um that suspects with a a a cyber
 
04:46:16.750 --> 04:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
security incident within the political
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
subdivisions information system that was
 
04:46:22.708 --> 04:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
the intention originally of of of the
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill and that just specifies it's just
 
04:46:28.750 --> 04:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
concerning those uh information systems
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
of the municipality and not anyone
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
anyone's personal or business computer
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's pretty much all I have
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the way of detail here but I believe
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
that commiss uh commissioner goule is
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
here to answer more details but I'm also
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any other questions
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's just uh pretty much it's a very
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward Bill thank you
 
04:46:52.510 --> 04:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
representor let me ask you a question
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
would you consider a fill on the blank
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
type of report where the intent of that
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
would be to truncate the amount of
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
reporting to be done so that in spot you
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
don't have a two-line message and other
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
spot you have a two-page message would
 
04:47:10.830 --> 04:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
you consider some type of a fill-in-the
 
04:47:10.840 --> 04:47:12.670 align:start position:0%
you consider some type of a fill-in-the
blank

04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
blank
 
04:47:12.680 --> 04:47:14.190 align:start position:0%
blank
report

04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
um uh I personally find that a
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable suggestion uh but I would
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
definitely defer to uh commissioner GLE
 
04:47:26.110 --> 04:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
on on the details of anything like that
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions to this
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
witness it's commission oh
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh I saw this and I thought right
 
04:47:40.400 --> 04:47:42.548 align:start position:0%
uh I saw this and I thought right
away

04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh why do we need something like this I
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
would think that uh the uh State
 
04:47:53.548 --> 04:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
information manager or whatever they
 
04:47:56.350 --> 04:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
call it would uh would have this as a
 
04:48:00.548 --> 04:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
regulation within uh uh or a policy
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
within his her viw rather than you know
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
having another law what are what are
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
that well my understanding is from my
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with commissioner gule is
 
04:48:15.150 --> 04:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
that he doesn't have that Authority at
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
this point and the other thing worth
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
pointing out is that many
 
04:48:21.628 --> 04:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities in our state don't
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the expertise on site
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
of their own to sometimes troubles shoot
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
serious problems but if gu if
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner gay is not involved in that
 
04:48:35.948 --> 04:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
then that could put the state's
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
computers at risk follow up yes follow
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
um well in my mind
 
04:48:49.708 --> 04:48:49.718 align:start position:0%
uh the towns or municipalities informing
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the the state about this would be uh the
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
Catalyst for uh the state taking some
 
04:48:58.510 --> 04:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
action so it's one of these things that
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh the important thing is that the state
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
is notified you know yes and uh I still
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
believe that uh it would be better to
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
have a regulation or a policy at the
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
state level than than another law but uh
 
04:49:13.120 --> 04:49:14.150 align:start position:0%
state level than than another law but uh
your

04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:49:16.590 --> 04:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you uh representative for
 
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
that question I still I totally agree
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
with you that would should be adequate
 
04:49:23.948 --> 04:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
but I still want to defer to uh
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner gay to answer that in
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
detail because he's the one who has to
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue thank
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
you yes Diane thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
question to date are you aware of any
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
incidences or examples in which this
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislation or Bill if it were passed
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
would have helped um a political
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision in there for the state so my
 
04:49:55.390 --> 04:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
question is are you aware of any um
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
recent situations thank you thank you
 
04:50:01.548 --> 04:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
representative for the question I
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not specifically
 
04:50:08.030 --> 04:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh aware of an incident that happened in
 
04:50:08.040 --> 04:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
uh aware of an incident that happened in
our

04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
state as far as what how what the
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
engagement of that municipality was with
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
the state of course we all heard about
 
04:50:19.230 --> 04:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
what happened in perville where pretty
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
much their computers were locked up or
 
04:50:23.910 --> 04:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
taken ransom for a while I don't know
 
04:50:25.948 --> 04:50:25.958 align:start position:0%
whether the state was involved in
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
resolving that issue or not uh again
 
04:50:30.750 --> 04:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
like I said I don't have that personal
 
04:50:32.910 --> 04:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
information that uh commissioner guay
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
would have but uh I would think in that
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
situation there might have been
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
Assistance or help from the state could
 
04:50:43.470 --> 04:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
help them quicker resolve their issues
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
but I I encourage you to ask the
 
04:50:50.350 --> 04:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
question to commissioner gule any other
 
04:50:53.670 --> 04:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
questions San is the commissioner here
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes if I may um could I
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
just do a brief introduction oh and then
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I you know I think I can help with
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
some of those questions as well um my
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
name is Dennis goule I'm the
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
Information Technology the state of New
 
04:51:25.520 --> 04:51:27.110 align:start position:0%
Information Technology the state of New
Hampshire

04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
and we I support this bill for three
 
04:51:35.788 --> 04:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
reasons um one is um in the event that
 
04:51:38.350 --> 04:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
there is an incident we're pretty aware
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
of what the resources what resources
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
exist state and federal level um that
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
can help out when these things occur and
 
04:51:51.150 --> 04:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen multiple instances where the
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision was not aware
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
of what could be brought to bear to
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
assist them so that's one helpful thing
 
04:52:00.270 --> 04:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
and we have seen direct evidence that
 
04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
that's you know once we become aware um
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
we've been able to
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
help with um you know the uh direction
 
04:52:07.080 --> 04:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
help with um you know the uh direction
of

04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:52:10.590 --> 04:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
resources um the second reason really is
 
04:52:13.230 --> 04:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
situational awareness if you've followed
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
the news over the past few years you've
 
04:52:17.070 --> 04:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
seen some states where multiple
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions have been hit
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
with ransomware or some other attacks
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
all at the same time so it would be
 
04:52:26.590 --> 04:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
really helpful you know if we know that
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
something's going on in one place uh
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
that situational
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
awareness to help make sure that we're
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
alerting all the all appropriate
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
authorities and all folks that could
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
help so that if it happens in another
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
place the response can be triggered
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
faster one of the rules about cyber
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
incidents is that the more quickly you
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
recognize it and respond to it um the
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
less likely it is to be severe and then
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
the third um reason is the one that
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch brought up which is
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
that you know we do connect to these um
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
entities for a couple reasons Town
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
clerks for processing DMV transactions
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
as well as law enforcement for the the
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
the research that local law enforcement
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
entities do as well as um other other uh
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
things that are done from a law
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective so that that
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
concludes my formal testimony I could go
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
into a couple of the questions right now
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then we can take as many as we need
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions but uh it uh
 
04:53:41.310 --> 04:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
it seems that uh if you are you have a
 
04:53:43.548 --> 04:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
connection with the uh the
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh uh information systems
 
04:53:50.590 --> 04:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
that you you would have some sort of uh
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
rules that that guide or govern that
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
connection and uh I would see this as
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
nothing more than another section within
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
that guidance on uh what to do should uh
 
04:54:05.548 --> 04:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
a cyber security incidents happen is
 
04:54:05.558 --> 04:54:06.350 align:start position:0%
a cyber security incidents happen is
this

04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
correct um I'm not I'm not aware of of a
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
set of rules Associated that we we make
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how they should
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
connect and we um we give them different
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
options for connecting but it's it's as
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
simple as that we don't put we have not
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
imposed rules on how they operate their
 
04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
own um their own networks in fact I
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't think we'd be able to do that that
 
04:54:32.110 --> 04:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
would that would drive cost into their
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
operations by us PR gating rules because
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
we would probably expect things to be
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
stricter and we know that we operate our
 
04:54:42.270 --> 04:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
Network more strictly than than does um
 
04:54:45.150 --> 04:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
many or most of the
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities follow follow up please
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
well it would seem to me that uh if you
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
could provide some guidance on how they
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
should operate their networks that would
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
be cheaper than uh
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
the cost of implementing some
 
04:55:12.190 --> 04:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
things that in a form of a question all
 
04:55:14.910 --> 04:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
right I I believe that
 
04:55:20.110 --> 04:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh it would be cheaper for them to
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
accept guidance by you than it would be
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
for them to find out later that they had
 
04:55:26.590 --> 04:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
an incident is that correct that's
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
correct in fact we are working closely
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
with uh the nhma municipal Association
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
as well as primex to work with
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities to advise them on how to
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
secure their own
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
networks um using a set of uh controls
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
that are prom promulgated and are
 
04:55:49.390 --> 04:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
standardly used around the world called
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
the CIS controls so primex has been you
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
know we we've been working with primex
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure that what they're asking
 
04:55:58.270 --> 04:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
their they
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
customers is the same thing we're asking
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
for so that we're not making them to to
 
04:56:05.470 --> 04:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
do different things and you obviously we
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
have different interests primex is it's
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
loss control right they they're the
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
liability insurer we're the folks who
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to keep you know continuity of
 
04:56:16.270 --> 04:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
government through our you know Citizen
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
Services through keeping the systems
 
04:56:20.350 --> 04:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
running so we have we are aligning on
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
that and that is absolutely a prime
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
yes um I notice on
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
um line
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
um five it talks about when they
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
discover the
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
incident they shall report it
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
immediately uh should
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
we I understand what immediately means
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
but let's say they discovered at the end
 
04:56:54.990 --> 04:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the day on
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
Friday and they I mean uh uh and the
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
town clerk has already gone home for the
 
04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
weekend should we should we be more
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
specific than just saying
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
immediately um well when they presumably
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
in in that example that if if something
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
happens over the weekend which is
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
actually quite possible and even likely
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
because our the criminal actors uh tend
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
to try to time things when they think
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
they'll be optimal like during a holiday
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
or weekend or something like that but in
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
that case they wouldn't be they may not
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
be aware of it till Monday so they'd be
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
in compliance but I will also O say that
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
um time is of the essence especially on
 
04:57:40.590 --> 04:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
ransomware um for example um in in
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
200 15 when I joined the state we had a
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
a well-contained ransomware incident
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
that um in in the executive branch that
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
um was able to Ransom
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
150,000 files in less than five
 
04:58:02.830 --> 04:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
minutes so um so timing is pretty
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
important important and and and it's
 
04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
really easy to report that was another
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
question that came up we have a 7 by 24
 
04:58:12.670 --> 04:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
line that takes calls um so that
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
essentially the process is during the
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
day if what if somebody were to call
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
that line and report a cyber incident my
 
04:58:20.750 --> 04:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
staff would take the call they're
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
classified state employees in the off
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
hours those calls drop into State Police
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
Dispatch they have a script for handling
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
them I would get the call 7 by 24 so we
 
04:58:33.310 --> 04:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
have a we have a 7 by 24 capability
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
there to to catch a call to respond to
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
it to look not only to assist um if we
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
can and and we have done that I've done
 
04:58:43.868 --> 04:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
that in the middle of you know late late
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
at night for political subdivisions
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
there was another question had you know
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
is there is there practical benefit from
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
this yes there has been I can give you a
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
number of incidents although the you
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
know I would want the political
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
subdivision themselves to it's their
 
04:59:00.430 --> 04:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
private information about their system
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't share it in a public forum
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
but um um you know certainly we have
 
04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
several examples over the past five
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
years where we've you know the state
 
04:59:11.788 --> 04:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
government has been able to assist and
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and or leverage Federal resources
 
04:59:17.230 --> 04:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
or private resources like primex to help
 
04:59:17.240 --> 04:59:18.788 align:start position:0%
or private resources like primex to help
them

04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
out thank you thank you Mr commissioner
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the commissioner
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and representative for
 
04:59:29.628 --> 04:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question because I think it
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
might go to both of you but I'm not 100%
 
04:59:32.670 --> 04:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
sure I'm thinking of an incident that
 
04:59:34.270 --> 04:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
happened in Northampton the town that I
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
represent a couple of years ago where we
 
04:59:38.590 --> 04:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
were uh we were the victims of fraud we
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
immediately reported it to our it vendor
 
04:59:43.548 --> 04:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
and we took the the necessary
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
precautions actions that were required
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I just want to understand
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
then if this were to be implemented and
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
I certainly think it's a good idea what
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
would have happened then would would the
 
04:59:58.110 --> 04:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
St would your role be that one of a
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative with us would one Trump the
 
05:00:03.868 --> 05:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
other um I'm just trying to understand
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
because our we we contract a lot of
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
money with our vendor but if you know
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
the state's not charging us for it you
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
know maybe we go to somebody like the
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
nhma and say we'll take your legal
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
advice rather than go to our
 
05:00:19.030 --> 05:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
attorney well that that's a good
 
05:00:20.910 --> 05:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
question and it goes to a a previous
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
question um so U my authority in in in
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
our enabling legislation RSA
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
21r um is restricted to the executive
 
05:00:32.480 --> 05:00:33.788 align:start position:0%
21r um is restricted to the executive
branch

05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
branch
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
state government so I I would have no
 
05:00:39.150 --> 05:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
Authority and probably should not have
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
authority over um how I a political
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
subdivision responds to a uh a
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
Cyber attack so in the case you guys did
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
a great job I was aware of what was
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
going on and you know you responded
 
05:00:56.030 --> 05:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
quickly we you know the um generally the
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
in an incident like that all we did when
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
once we found out was make sure that all
 
05:01:04.510 --> 05:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
the appro resources no whether it was
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
the you know Financial crimes division
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
for the Secret Service or the FBI or
 
05:01:11.708 --> 05:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
primex but sometimes primex finds out
 
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they tell us and sometimes we find
 
05:01:16.350 --> 05:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
out we tell primex and we Loop the right
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
authorities in so we would take a a we
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
would stand by to help that's typically
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we do some sometimes we have helped
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
a lot other times we've said hey you
 
05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
know we're pretty good um and then we
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
might if it's ransomware we might
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
disconnect that connection until we know
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've secured it because we don't want
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
to have those that that
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
ransomware flow into the state Network
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and start taking State systems down but
 
05:01:49.470 --> 05:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
um does that okay but I don't have a lot
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
of extra money we so we and we do have
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
some Grant funds that um were recently
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
um appropriated through accepting expend
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee that is targeted 100%
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
at municipal cyber security which I'd be
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
happy to share but I don't want to take
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
time up for this committee thank you
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you gentlemen oh
 
05:02:13.150 --> 05:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
sorry one more
 
05:02:15.548 --> 05:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question as a
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
freshman state representative I'm not
 
05:02:24.670 --> 05:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with the term that any vendor
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
acting as an agent of the political
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision do you help me to understand
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
what a vendor would be thank you sure we
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
have you know the our political
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
subdivisions are of all shapes and
 
05:02:38.430 --> 05:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
colors in in New Hampshire and
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
particularly all sizes right so you have
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
fairly large cities then you have these
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
teeny weeny you know little entities
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes less than 20 people comprising
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
them and the way they manage their it
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
function is very different so some of
 
05:02:56.190 --> 05:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
them have some IT staff who actually
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
support their information technology
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
needs and others have no it staff at all
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a town manager who manages a
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
what we call a managed service provider
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
or MSP and then that entity actually
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
runs their entire it function and and
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%

05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
there because it is very prevalent
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%

05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%

um thank you uh nhma does not have a
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
position on House Bill 12 77 but we have
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
been talking with commissioner goule now
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
I think for a couple years about
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
legislation to this effect um and the
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
Department's interest in having
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that would have
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities report cyber incidents to
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Technology
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
really our only comment on the
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is the amendment that
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative somuch spoke about a few
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
moments ago that would be lines four and
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
five changing the language from cyber
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
incident within such political
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision to within the political
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
subdivision information system and the
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
need for that is I could see this being
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
interpreted to mean that any cyber
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
incident occurring in the geographical
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the municipality would
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
need to be reported and of course that's
 
05:04:56.750 --> 05:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the legislation um so
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's our only comment on the bill and
 
05:05:00.548 --> 05:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
that is what we would ask be amended if
 
05:05:03.868 --> 05:05:03.878 align:start position:0%
the legislation were to pass pass um and
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
those are my comments on the bill but
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
