um so let's um first uh turn our
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
it is requiring the Department of
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
Education to maintain student records of
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
students um and representative Freeman

did you have a motion yes thank you Mr
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
second a second thank you very much um

would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair very briefly um I
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
I moved to um uh in expediate to
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
legislate this bill because we passed um
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
another charta school Bill about the
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
closure of charta schools which
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
addressed this very issue of maintaining
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
student record so this this bill
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
essentially is
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
duplicative correct any further
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
discussion yes is there a difference
 
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
though between the charter school
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
closing and the records going over the
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or a student
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
finishing the charter school and where
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
did the records go um the uh if the
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
charter school is in existence they stay
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
there but um the uh the bill that we had
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
um included both more detail on the
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
closure and things like probation and a
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
bond if necessary uh but in the last
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
section addressed um a closing uh
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
Charter School um and what happens to
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
bill could you just tell what was that
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
bill number do you know I'm sorry try I
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
was afraid you were going to ask that I
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
72

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
72
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank and the uh last section
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
on page two uh addresses Charter School

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
records and um I think both these bills
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
um were discussed with the Department um
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just that the uh sponsors um
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
topic reverent dry thank you I have um

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.350 align:start position:0%
um if we
might

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
um calls for information to be printed
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
on the ballot including the average cost
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
per pupil average daily enrollment for
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
the prior five years and uh teacher to
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
discussion R of s thank you um so I I
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
have some significant concerns about
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and whether it could be um
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
used essentially for electioneering on a
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
ballot um I also have concerns with as
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
much detail and information as being
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
requested in this which would be
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
available prior to a budget hearing and
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
prior to a deliberative session to
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
voters it seems to me this is more
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
information that's more appropriate to
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
be on a handout at the deliberative
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
session than at the ballot um but just
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
that the extent of copying costs and
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
everything else that this is a lot of
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
extra information to be included on a
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
ballot I know yesterday our my
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District was lucky in
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
only having a two-sided ballot but my
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
concern is this is going to end up with
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
multiple pages and and be cumbersome
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
process any other discussion represent
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we do hear from a lot of our
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
constituents on the town level that when
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
they walk into the voting booth that
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
they don't always have the luxury of
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
going to deliberative sessions district
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
school board meetings Etc and I think a
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill like this allow the local
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
communities to work out the particulars
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
as as far as what they want to but I
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
think a a bill like this allows those
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
districts and the voters to get the full
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
transparency that they deserve so um I I
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
of thank you representative maray thank
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I also want to be very um
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
careful here in addition to that um it
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
is not just the cost per pupil defined
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
by average daily enrollment but it is
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
divided out over the total expenditure
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
over the district so that is
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
that is a different number than just the
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil when just to be
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
clear um and I I concur with my
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
colleague representative selig with many
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
of the statements that she said I'm also
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
um curious why this information wouldn't
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
be included in perhaps a town voter
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
guide instead of it being on a ballot
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
those get uh distributed often times to
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
every resident uh to be able to peruse
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
through there's one for the town and one
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
for the district usually um that might
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
be a better place for it to be included
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
itself Noble thank you Mr chair I I just
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
want to make a comment about the
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
election earing um as far as I'm
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
concerned we already have that on our
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
ballots we have school board recommends
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
a yes Vote or School Board recommends a
 
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.149 align:start position:0%
a yes Vote or School Board recommends a
no

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
vote rep Woodcock thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning by the way um if I
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
um it was brought to our attention
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
during the hearings that this is a
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
duplicative duplicative bill law because
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
the current law which just went in
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
effect um July
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
1 this year um mandates mandate certain
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
reporting in the election so this is
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:28.039 align:start position:0%
um a waste in terms of value because
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
it's already in the law and I think it's
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
was 18976 if I recall right down that
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
that the attorney from uh Schoolboard
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
Association brought forward to us so um
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
that being the case actually I'm not
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
sure we we want to deal with this in
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
terms of it's just
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
you rent Marie yes thank you Mr chair I
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
think the other thing that we might want
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
to um just be careful about i f the
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
record a dis positive vote printed on a
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
ballot is just stating a public record
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know while I understand
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
the memb point um it it's just a
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
reflection of the outcome of a vote
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
there was no other statement enumerated
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
so that's public record that's already
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
part of a record of a body meeting and
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
deciding on something um and with that I
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
you know I also see that there are
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
definitions uh in the statute that
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
Define administrator versus full-time
 
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.230 align:start position:0%
Define administrator versus full-time
teacher

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
I am not clear whether or not those
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
definitions would even be included for
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the voter on the ballot when they're
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
reading those um it it seems clunky and
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
me res did you have your hand up well I
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
I did part of it was about the we had I
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
have a note in my notes that we needed a
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
further clarification of what
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
encompassed administrator or what
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
administrator Encompass because there's
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
so many things listed I also have a note
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing about the part-time
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
staff and then just in response to
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative Noble's point you know if
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
if the bill simply said a budget
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
committee um like the school board um
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know approves it or recommends it or
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
approves or voted you know 8 to six on
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
this item the budget committee voted six
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
to eight on this item that would be a
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
different thing to me and I wouldn't
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
have an objection to that I just feel
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
like this is far more information than
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
belongs on a ballot this is information
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward prior to getting to the
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
ballot prior at the deliberative session
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
this information would be when it ought
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
shared thank you R Woodcock just I'm I'm
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
sure everyone has their red book in
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
front of them if they if they go to I
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
have my r book in front of me um if you
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
go to one
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
18976 it it tells you if you look at the
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
four or five six things which the
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
Republican legislature and the
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans on this committee last year
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
put in um and was passed ass signed by
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the governor it cover it has salaries it
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
has your graph it has administra has
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
everything you ask for and this bill by
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
itself that we're look discussing the
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
duplicate this you already have it it's
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
starting for the first time
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
ever so it's like we don't need to kill
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
camel thank
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
you um represent B Bon um and I also
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
want to point out this this very
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
particular to school district budgets I
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
mean there's nothing like this on a Town
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
budget a ballot at the you know it just
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's singling out school districts
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
with information that isn't is skewed
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
because of the way that it's the
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions are asked I'm looking at
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
full-time teachers administrators again
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these um information um can
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
be um it's hard to get an accurate play
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
I mean what is a full-time teacher what
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
about therapists uh you know uh par
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
professionals uh uh so I object to it
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
because um it seems to be singly not
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
school districts and it's not something
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
ballot res
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair um and and
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative woodcart for
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
pointing this out um on 189 um colon 776
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
however this is just public information
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
being posted if and now that this has
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
been codified into law seeing as they
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
already get this information together
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to make it that much easier
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
for them to print it on a ballot right
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
there R Paul thank you Mr chair um this
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
information should be readily available
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
on the doe
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
website you know with a new legislation
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't it makes no sense to me that
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
that's printed on a ballot it's there's
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
enough information on there already
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you repr
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
NATO uh I just wanted to say as a a a
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire for many years
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's a
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
little uh I'm not a techsavvy and
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
neither of probably the Elder folks in
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
town so uh so it it does make it a lot
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
easier for people to say oh it's it's
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
right here black and white and right in
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
front of me and they can do their kind
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
their own comparisons instead of trying
 
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
to kind of weave their way through the
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
web uh thank
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
you r m again I to the member's point it
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
is well taken I appreciate that um many
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
towns across the state print voter
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
guides and they are
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
quite all-encompassing there's one for
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
the town like I mentioned there's one
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
for the school boards those have Amur
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
pages that you can then take they're
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
often sent out uh several weeks uh prior
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
to voting and you can take a look
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
through those ask questions attend your
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
school board meetings I I am unsure what
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
the cost would then be to the town to
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
print these ballots with such a
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
lengthy um description on them and I to
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
to what end are we going to continue to
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
put this stuff on the physical ballot I
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
think we had at least five pages I
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
believe for our ballot this year without
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
any of this
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
r s thank you um just the last thing
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'll say is that in terms of online
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
sign-ins we have a 10 uh a 10 to1 ratio
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
right it's um five people wrote in in
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
support and 52 people wrote in in
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and I think we
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
need to recognize our constituents are
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
giving us a clear message they're not in
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
favor of it ref Noble just on that point
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
real quick about the numbers online
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
um for HB 361 and 36
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
um the the public was in favor of both
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
those bills one is the mass mandate bill
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
for schools and the other one was the
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
centers rent Terry not withstanding uh
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
the arguments that I heard on both
 
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.909 align:start position:0%
the arguments that I heard on both
Sid

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
Sid
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh I know that the information is
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
available on the doe website I know that
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
there is information that's made
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
available at deliberative sessions I
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
also know the attendance at deliberative
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
sessions in many of our communities and
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
I know as well that as I walked past the
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
poster yesterday on the way into the
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
polls that most people were just going
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
right on by it with all of the
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
information that was provided what I
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
know is that for many many people the
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
first time that they are dealing with
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
any of the questions that we're putting
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
before them is when they go into the
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
voting booth and they read what is on
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
the ballot so where I would prefer a
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
shorter ballot and I would prefer that
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
people would do their homework the
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
reality of the situation is that people
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
scores of people are not even beginning
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with these questions until they
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
read them on the ballot and they think
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
about what they're going to do right
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
then and there thank you I would just
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
add that um in my town my post office
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
closed and I now have rural delivery
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
which hasn't worked out too well I just
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
got a Valentine's Day card in the mail
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
yesterday we should have you
 
00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
yesterday we should have you
going

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
right um rent maray thank you Mr chair I
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of faith in our voters I
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
think our voters in New Hampshire are um
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
well well poised on a lot of things as
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters we have a lot of
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
Engagement in our electoral process and
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
I I would want to make sure that we are
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
empowering individuals to make the best
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
choices possible I understand what
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative but to the
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
same point we also have to make sure
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
that we are making fiscally prudent
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
choices for our towns and our
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
communities and by double printing this
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
information in potentially a town voter
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
guide and on a ballot
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
I I am concerned that there may be
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
another vehicle that would be more
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate than printing it on a ballot
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
represent litfield thank you so I just
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
want to share that the particular
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
District that I come from it's one of
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
the larger districts and it's very
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
interesting because we have a
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
combination of a school district meeting
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
we have a town meeting we also have sb2
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
for the co-op we have zero voter guides
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
I attend all of it the only thing that's
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
available to the voters is the annual
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
Town report which lists the warrant
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
articles a lot of people just don't
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
understand it so I do think there's some
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
validity to putting this on the ballot
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
also I get what you're saying I think a
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
voter guide would be great I think there
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
are concerns about that honestly being
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
electioneering depending on how or who
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
puts it out there but I would think that
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
voter guide would be much more costly
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
than adding something simple to the
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
ballot um representative Hall thank you
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I guess I would ask the
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
question so what's the next step so if
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
you go into the voting booth and you see
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
three people running for Library
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
trustees and you have no clue who any of
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
them are you haven't heard about them
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
now do we have to have descriptions of
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
who these people are on the ballot
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
because to make sure that they're
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
informed I I I'm going to go with
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
represent Murray and say I think that
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
our our voters are informed and if
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're not then they should be I mean
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
putting all this information seems like
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
way too much thank you Murray um thank
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr shair and one other point
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
regarding this this is a lot of a lot of
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
conversation around voting and while I I
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
know that this is germine conversation
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
to our education department we did not
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
hear from the Secretary of State on um

so

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.230 align:start position:0%

representative cordelli would you like
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
to discuss the amendment uh thank you
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
um there were a number of
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
um uh points raised during the
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
hearing um we uh subsequently worked
 
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
hearing um we uh subsequently worked
with

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh m de from the Department of Education
 
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
special direct director who talked to a
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
number of people um at the hearing um
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
and this is the result of our
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
conversations with her and uh her
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
suggestions in terms of um what would um
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to be added to these uh
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
definitions and I'll just mention that
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
these um are
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
definitions uh related to special
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
education um and they are an outgrowth
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the uh audit that was done um last
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
year uh which um had comments in it um
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
that uh uh called for some additional
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
definitions being being added to statute
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
they in some cases they were in rules
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
but not in statute uh so it was um
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
recommended they be put into statute
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
also um so um these were those uh
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
instructions um plus one other thing
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
that um we did on the bottom of page two
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
um also as a response to the discussions
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
changed um starting on line
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
28 um functionally blind pupils to
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
students with visual
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
impairments um and made uh that change
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
in um RSA 186
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
c7b now was the one other change in
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the uh definitions that were
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
hearing since I'm the second I have no
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
other comments any other
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
discussion okay representative bbon
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
um I find that there's still a number of
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
questions that I have about this bill um
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
because of um and and I don't think your
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
second amendment really addresses all
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
the concerns as well I I wonder I don't
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
I I know you it has been said that
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were um involved in
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
discussions but I I I have heard
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise and that I also have some
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about going out and changing
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
this this is a lot of language that it's
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
very important to a lot of people and
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
you heard from them when they came and
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
objected to it I don't think these
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
changes are solve the problem I think
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
the bill the some of is still clunky um
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
I question I see on the this amendment
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
the Charter Public Schools were added
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I if I look in particular at line 16
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
and 17 where it says this environment is
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
managed by the uh School District
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School Etc well um um
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
when special ed students attend Charter
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
Schools it's the responsibility of the
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
school district Lea to take care of um
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
to manage that child's special education
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
and so it's a little confusing if you
 
01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
put it in here and say that um put that
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the charter schools
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
whereas again I think you heard um
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
before with that bill 222 that came in
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's awful lot of confusion between
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
the charter schools and the School
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
departments in terms of uh delivery to
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
special education um services to those
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
children in special in in charter
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
schools so um and also I if you're
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the audit of the special
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh dispute resolution processes I
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't specifically remember having this
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
language being brought up as necessary
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
changes there were definitely some
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
comments about saying that uh the state
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
needs to better align their definitions
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
with um the federal definitions and I I
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
agree with that but I do know that
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
there's another a more comprehensive
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
audit that is going is happening right
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
now within the whole special education
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
department and it seems to me that it
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be most um diligent of us to wait
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
for that whole audit to come out and not
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
and why and instead of trying to do this
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
Pac mail before we figure out what other
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
definitions need to be changed um so I
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
would recommend retaining this until we
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
get the results of that full uh special
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
education audit which I believe is going
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
to coming out um this year maybe
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
chairman cordelli knows when when that
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
still out but it seems to be um
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
irresponsible us to rush forward with
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
something so important to so many people
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um the section related to the
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
education environment
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
um I think was specifically addressed um
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
because the department wanted to make
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure that uh suitable facilities were
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
being used um there had been in the past
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
some uh reports of uh uh students being
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
placed in rooms that might not be
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
suitable and that uh they wanted to make
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
sure that those students were in
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
um representative dve thank you and I
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that one of the
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
um comments in the hearing was that we
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
did not refer to federal law in some of
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
the definitions that we said we were
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
trying to emulate or or um at least um
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
get on record in our statute and I want
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
to say that this does that in all of
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
those places where exactly as it was
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
do represent muray thank you um Madam
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I am concerned if uh there were not
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders consulted with this
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to representative Bon's points
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
um this is a deeply impactful piece of
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to a group that
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
struggles almost routinely to be heard
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
and seen in places that um creating if
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
that is the case I I I would encourage
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
us to just take a moment and maybe have
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
a different conversation if that has not
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Hall thank you
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair um to Echo what uh
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative Murray said when we sat
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
at that hearing there were many many
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
angry people out there many um and when
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
that hearing ended I really thought that
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the key stakeholders were going to sit
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
down I don't care if it was on Zoom or
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
sit down in a meeting and really come up
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
with something that they could all agree
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
to that to me has you know when I hear
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
you know the doe I heard uh Rebecca
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
Fett's name mentioned but we're talking
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
about all those other other stakeholders
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
why why is this here without their input
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
or did did we get their input and we
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
didn't like it um I guess I would that's
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
my question to whomever would know the
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
answer what happened to those
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
folks and their
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
input representative cordelli thank you
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
I just comment that there were a lot of
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
angry people at that hearing because
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
there had been a lot of misinformation
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
about this bill uh being put out by or
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
two groups um so that's why there were
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
angry people here who uh did not
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand and were misled about uh the
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
say thank you um I would say that if if
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
those people were confused or misled I
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't think we've done anything then um
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
to reach out to them and really it tell
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
them what what this is especially if
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
this bill if this amender is being
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
crafted with only a few people involved
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
so if we truly want to put something
 
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.709 align:start position:0%
so if we truly want to put something
forward

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
that with the intent that I think
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
everyone wants is that they understand
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
what is being done in here then I would
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
I urge us to hold back and and do it the
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
right way and I I guess I still don't
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
understand why we need to rush this
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
through right now when we know that the
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
you represent muray thank you uh Madam
 
01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.390 align:start position:0%
you represent muray thank you uh Madam
chair

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
um I do recall there being questions and
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
clarifications during the hearing there
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
were also additional statements uh and
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
and desires to be involved in the
 
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
process of the Drafting and if that
 
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.790 align:start position:0%
process of the Drafting and if that
didn't

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
happen uh when this was crafted I think
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
that we do owe it to the group whether
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
whether the the feelings from the
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
membership you know interpreting certain
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
statements around misleading or not I we
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
owe it to that group of people to make
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
sure that this has
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
been um at least worked with alongside
 
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.070 align:start position:0%
been um at least worked with alongside
of

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli you've written many amendments
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember this amendment
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct this was not a
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
study committee this was an amendment
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
and um I think with all the testimony
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we did hear that particular day and
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
the misinformation that was floated
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
around in the atmosphere um we heard
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
everyone that spoke that day um and I do
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
believe that representative cordelli
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
heard every one of those person's
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerned so I find it a little
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
disingenuous when I hear that nobody had
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
any input into this when we had a full
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard many different people
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
on this subject and um you know I we can
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
beat this to death and we can we can go
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
back and forth on how many people should
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
be involved in an amendment but I I
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
remember a lot of amendments having a
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot of people sitting at the table doing
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
the Amendments if that's a study
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee then we'll put in a bill for a
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
study committee but that's not what this
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
was I just want to make a comment about
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
the audit because the way that I took it
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
this did not come out of the dispute
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
resolution audit that we had last year
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
this was part of the ongoing audit and
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
because they felt it was important
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
enough to make the change now and not
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
next year when um when that audit is
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
complete and um for for a couple of
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
reasons I think that had to do with the
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
approved educational
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
environment um to make sure that they
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
weren't in closets or boiler rooms like
 
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.070 align:start position:0%
weren't in closets or boiler rooms like
we

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
heard um as well as the
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
the section that had to do with related
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
Services where we only had a portion of
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
that in state law so someone could
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
interpret that as this is all the state
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
is doing so that was why this came
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
forward now versus when the audit is
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative dve thank you I think
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
this is a reflection of all the input
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we got at that hearing especially
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the part about approved educational
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
environment not only does it incorporate
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
putting in in a decent environment but
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
also incorporates the least restrictive
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
environment uh Clause that everybody was
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about the special definitions
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
that are in Roman numeral five
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
and uh seven and down below below are
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
taken from the federal law there's
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
nothing new here it's and it's reference
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
to the state law it's the law that we've
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
been operate or this federal law it's
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
the law that we've been operating under
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
it just now enumerates it and refers it
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the federal law in our
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
statutes representative Hall thank you
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair I would just like to say
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
that I think drafting an amendment with
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is not a study committee
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
you you you're getting input to draft an
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that's it it's not a study
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
opinion any other discussion
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bon um I just following
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
up on representative Noble's comment if
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
it if it does come from the audit that's
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
currently being um happening now I think
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
it would certainly clear up a lot of
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
information if that audit was public and
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
you could see where those um and it
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
would make more sense and it certainly
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
would give this amendment more uh
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
validity to and perhaps be more
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
supported by those folks that that had
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
some questions about it but as far as I
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
know there there hasn't been any uh
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
sections of that audit made public yet
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise represent Cornell Thank you
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I just think there are
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
still so many questions so much
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
disagreement um you know whether it was
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
through misinformation or not
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
3,268 people were opposed to this bill
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's a lot of constituents
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
whether they're whether they're confused
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
about what was intended whether they
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
heard misinformation that's still a lot
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
um and I would be more comfortable
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
retaining this to work on it more it is
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
so important um and there are so many
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
people that are still going to be not
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
understanding what's happening because
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
of the misin maybe misinformation maybe
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding um fear of what's going
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
to happen I think retaining it and
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
working on it more working on it with
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
more stakeholders um getting more input
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
from the um audit would just make more
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
me represent maray um thank you madam
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
chair and I I I also even in the first
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the proposed um Amendment
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh for 0606 we are I have not seen
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislation in a long time that has the
 
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.310 align:start position:0%
legislation in a long time that has the
and

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
slor and I I think that this is opening
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
the door for people to make choices
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
about how they're applying the um
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's twice in that first paragraph
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
where there is exceptional language for
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
Andor um and and so it it seems a little
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
bit subjective to me as far
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity for interpretation one
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
way or another that could also um have
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and I I just
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
wish that we would
 
01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
pause that um that first section was um
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
language that we got from the Brain
 
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.189 align:start position:0%
language that we got from the Brain
Injury

01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
Injury
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
Association on the um they acquired
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
brain injury
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that that's that what you're talking
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
you're representative cig thank you I I
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
was just hoping I maybe could get
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
clarification and I apologize that it's
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
taking me a minute to process all of
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
this but um looking at paragraph um
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two where it says approved
 
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
program means a program and it gives
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
this list um but it specifies within the
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
school district and I just think about
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
the does this therefore exclude people
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
who might be sent to an outof District
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
placement I'm I'm just trying to make
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand fully and and so
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
moment oh this is on the amendment I'm
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
sorry um approved program means a
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
program of special education within the
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative Celli yes I you're you're

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm still curious what happens if
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
they're being placed outside of their
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
District right I I I think that this is
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
um they facilities other private
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%

cover right bu you know any any

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
I don't seem to be able to find M eny
 
01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:58.570 align:start position:0%
because I was not here have an
 
01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
because I was not here have an
[Music]

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
extra representative
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
Bon um yeah so I thank you I just want
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
people to understand what this actually
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
does because it's it's confusing and it
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
took me a while to kind of figure it out
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
so I what currently um
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
um this information is not typically
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
disclosed at a um in advance of the
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference the purpose of a
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference is to narrow the
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
issues um so so what we're actually
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
doing in this Bill is saying that all
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
this information has to be released
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
prior to that um now a prehearing
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
conference uh sometimes leads to a
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
ruling that certain claims will not be
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
heard um because bared by the statute of
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
limitations or because the hearing
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
officer lacks uh jurisdiction over them
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
so requiring a school district to to
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
close Court exhibits before the
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference could um lead to a
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
lot of information being released to
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
hearing officers um and it could be you
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
know more work instead of instead of the
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
if the purpose was to simplify it I
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that is what it's doing um
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
so it it puts the onus on the school
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
district to provide all that information
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
in advance and it could be duplicative I
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
mean it it's a lot of extra work it's a
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
lot of um extra money for documents that
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
will and are available to the parent
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
already if they ask um so I I will not
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
be voting for it for that reason thank

03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay we will open the hearing on House
 
03:03:07.229 --> 03:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 695 FN relative to school districts
 
03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
and medically related grants this is a
 
03:03:10.399 --> 03:03:12.190 align:start position:0%
and medically related grants this is a
continuation

03:03:12.190 --> 03:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
continuation
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and I call Aubrey fredman to
 
03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:26.950 align:start position:0%
hearing and I call Aubrey fredman to
testify

03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.469 --> 03:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh Madame chair committee members uh
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
Aubrey fried I live in Bridgewater so I
 
03:03:34.229 --> 03:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
missed the hearing last week and I did
 
03:03:36.510 --> 03:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
already email uh all the committee
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
members so I'll just make one point
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
today which is on the the way the set up
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
now with accept you know applying for
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
and accepting a grant so school
 
03:03:50.910 --> 03:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
districts they practically apply for
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
every possible Grant but they do have to
 
03:03:56.269 --> 03:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing before accepting
 
03:03:59.790 --> 03:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
it and I've gone to Schoolboard meetings
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
and these hearings for years nobody
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
knows about them nobody attends them
 
03:04:05.359 --> 03:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
knows about them nobody attends them
they're

03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
hardly you know they just kind of slip
 
03:04:11.870 --> 03:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
through and there's very little
 
03:04:13.870 --> 03:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
testimony at all on them one way or the
 
03:04:15.469 --> 03:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
other it's usually just the school
 
03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
district um saying why they think it's a
 
03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
good idea it should be accepted and
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's the end I can only remember one
 
03:04:24.750 --> 03:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
Grant Hearing in like four years I've
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
been going to meetings and hearings
 
03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
where there was actually discussion and
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
opposition they still accepted it anyway
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
but at least there was discussion I
 
03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
think it makes more sense to have uh the
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh discussion go before somebody's
 
03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
already done the work to apply for it
 
03:04:45.550 --> 03:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
cuz once they've already applied it's
 
03:04:47.710 --> 03:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
like well we may as well accept it
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
anyway somebody spent the work and at
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
Town meetings they actually have decent
 
03:04:56.110 --> 03:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
attendance where people show up people
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't come to these hearings they barely
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
know about them so it makes sense to me
 
03:05:04.349 --> 03:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
to have the um discussion beforehand
 
03:05:06.229 --> 03:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
before somebody puts in the work to do
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
it and uh at the town meeting where
 
03:05:11.229 --> 03:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
people can actually discuss it if they
 
03:05:12.910 --> 03:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
vote forward well at least there's been
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
a a fair hearing and discussion on it
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
rather than just rush the whole uh
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
project through without really any
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
discussion so that's why I support the
 
03:05:25.710 --> 03:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you any
 
03:05:28.030 --> 03:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:05:30.750 --> 03:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you and that will close the

school and the prime sponsor is here
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
represent Vice chairman Noble thank you
 
03:46:37.229 --> 03:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
03:46:38.710 --> 03:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Kristen
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
Noble and I represent Hillsboro District
 
03:46:42.149 --> 03:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
2 the town of
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
Bedford um this is actually a very
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
simple bill it's just um language
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
cleanup um from a bill that was passed
 
03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
and signed in
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
20121 um the the reason I I found this
 
03:47:00.149 --> 03:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
was because I was doing a little bit of
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
research on Supreme Court decisions that
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
had to do with school choice and so I
 
03:47:08.830 --> 03:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
came to
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
um uh one uh decision that was uh Carson
 
03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
versus Mon and that had to do that was
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
in from Maine and it had to do with Town
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
tuition and
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
um being able to um use that the town
 
03:47:30.510 --> 03:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
tuition to go to a religious school and
 
03:47:32.590 --> 03:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
as part of that I found an article that
 
03:47:36.030 --> 03:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
said that Governor sonunu had signed a
 
03:47:40.189 --> 03:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill um that allowed this and I think um
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is what
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
allowed um uh there was a case Cen I I
 
03:47:48.990 --> 03:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
think where they wanted to use um the
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
town tuition money to go to a religious
 
03:47:53.120 --> 03:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
town tuition money to go to a religious
school

03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:47:58.349 --> 03:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
um so the first section I I was trying
 
03:48:02.189 --> 03:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
to find what the bill was and um but I
 
03:48:04.349 --> 03:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
ended up searching the rsas and the
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
first one I had come to was this 191
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.110 --> 03:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
1-A um and that you can that's page 478
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
um that says pursuant to RSA 193 col 3
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 6 a school board May
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
execute a contract with any approved
 
03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:33.149 align:start position:0%
execute a contract with any approved
nonsectarian

03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
nonsectarian
 
03:48:35.469 --> 03:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
private private school approved by the
 
03:48:39.630 --> 03:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
school board so 193 colon
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
three Roman
 
03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:43.429 align:start position:0%

03:48:47.670 --> 03:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
six um that word non sectarian had been
 
03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
um removed from there and that was the
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that the governor had signed
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
back in 20121 so this is just cleaning
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
up that that one word and that's
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%

03:49:46.149 --> 03:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
here a page on that difficult that 539
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
539 sorry I thought I I have it okay

okay that's right so the word was
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
removed from there and so this this um
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
189 colon 1- a is Roman numeral 4 which
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
is Page 478 is saying pursuant to RSA
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
193 col 3 Roman numeral 6 and then it
 
03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:15.110 align:start position:0%
193 col 3 Roman numeral 6 and then it
has

03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:50:20.670 --> 03:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
the language of of um cross yeah just
 
03:50:23.229 --> 03:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
Crossroad yeah yes thank you we just
 
03:50:26.110 --> 03:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
cross ring yes yes thank
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
you right um I I think actually this
 
03:50:31.469 --> 03:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
might be the
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
third um incident uh instance we've seen
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we missed in the original uh Bill
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
to cross out that
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none thank you very
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.189 --> 03:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
Freeman uh Mr chairman committee members
 
03:51:15.389 --> 03:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
uh Aubrey Friedman brid S I speak in
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
support of this bill well I didn't
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
realize that this just sounds like this
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
was an oversight I definitely think uh
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
but I'll just make a quick point I think
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
religious schools are fine it's good to
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
have more options and religious schools
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
they actually have higher standards than
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh reg traditional government schools
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
when my son went to Catholic school and
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
I went to a tour of the school um I was
 
03:51:42.149 --> 03:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
amazed they actually said what the
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
grading scale was you know like 9080
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
7060 and their A's ended at 93 and B's
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
ended at like 85 and then 77 and then 70
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
that was it so they have very high
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
standards so I think religious schools
 
03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
are good and it's good to have more
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
options and I'm glad this is just fixing
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
a little clerical problem with the law
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh
 
03:52:09.149 --> 03:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:52:10.990 --> 03:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um was there anyone in the
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
audience who wished to uh furiously
 
03:52:15.149 --> 03:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
filling out my pink C
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.149 --> 03:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you good afternoon for the
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Diana Fenton I'm an
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
attorney with the Department of
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
Education I would like
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
to address the issue that was
 
03:53:08.590 --> 03:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
raised um if we look at 193 colon
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
because that's the cross reference in
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're considering is a
 
03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
cross reference to
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
1933 I want to bring your attention to
 
03:53:25.120 --> 03:53:28.630 align:start position:0%
1933 I want to bring your attention to
page

03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
540 and I'll give everyone a moment to
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.229 --> 03:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
may if you look on page 540 in the right
 
03:53:50.429 --> 03:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
hand column Under The Heading amendments
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
where the print gets really small and I
 
03:53:54.389 --> 03:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
think to myself I should really call my
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
eye doctor again right because this is
 
03:53:59.790 --> 03:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
where they talk about the changes that
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
have occurred in the
 
03:54:04.590 --> 03:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
past it's great to rely on historical
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
memory I rely on mine all the time and
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
then I realize it's not as good as it
 
03:54:10.269 --> 03:54:10.279 align:start position:0%
used to be I would encourage this
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
committee to look in this section here
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
under amendments notably
 
03:54:17.710 --> 03:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
where the Bold says 2021 talks about the
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments that were
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
created not too long
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
down this is paragraph six chapter 106
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
colum 2 now that's very deep in the
 
03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
woods on statutory instruction where
 
03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
they talk about the chapter number but
 
03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
it it says it rewrote the paragraph
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
which now we'll read as follows
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
and it recites the law and it has the
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
non- secretari in there so then it was
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
removed and that's what this bill is
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do this bill is really a
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
cleanup a technical bill that's trying
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
to match the language but now that this
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
bill is in front of this committee for
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
its consideration I would encourage this
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that Amendment
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
section and it will talk to you about
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
the history of of 1933 because 933 is
 
03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
one of those bills that we talked about
 
03:55:19.510 --> 03:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
during the um opportunity that I had to
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
come in front of you to provide some
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
training 19 through3 has been amended
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and I will share with you
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
that um when I have to dig into the
 
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
really get into the Weeds on legislative
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation and legislative
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
history the person that I turn to really
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
is Jen right in the corner there she's
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
an excellent researcher sorry Jen I just
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
outed you I'm sorry sorry she'll never
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
forgive me um this is a great place to
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
start this amendment section look at the
 
03:55:50.910 --> 03:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
language and I think in looking at it it
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
will be clear that this really is just a
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
technical cleanup bill so that the
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
language is matching I'm happy to take
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
any questions but I wanted to take this
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to highlight that for this
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration I appreciate
 
03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:03.269 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration I appreciate
your

03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
time any questions represent woodcot
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you CH good afternoon ter Fenton
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
um just just a question so what happens
 
03:56:15.550 --> 03:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
if the bill doesn't pass
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
is this build as
 
03:56:19.389 --> 03:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
the and then you have an inconsistency
 
03:56:20.990 --> 03:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:24.030 align:start position:0%
in the
law

03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.429 --> 03:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
happens you make the position s go
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
ahead so when you have an inconsistency
 
03:56:36.510 --> 03:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
in the law then you have to get into
 
03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation and part of
 
03:56:41.349 --> 03:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
that is looking at the history of the
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
bill which one was changed last and so
 
03:56:46.750 --> 03:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
you would defer to 1833 and you look at
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
that history and you'd see that it was a
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
technical oversight um and my
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
understanding although I can't recall at
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
the top of my head is that other bills
 
03:56:57.950 --> 03:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
have come before this committee to
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
identify areas where that language is
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
used and and strike it so I think the
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
legislative history would support that
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the inconsistency is
 
03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
really an oversight um but that's what
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
would happen is you would have a
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
questions resident
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:57:27.750 --> 03:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm just wondering
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
so it applies to two different things
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
though right I mean at the beginning um
 
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
this section is about oh manifest
 
03:57:38.469 --> 03:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
hardship and if I I'm going to the
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
beginning of the section um which I just
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
lost uh because I was on the amendment
 
03:57:49.670 --> 03:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
um oh uh 1933 all addresses the change
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
of school or assignment in the best
 
03:57:55.030 --> 03:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the student whereas an um
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
where it the other change was made is
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
just in the general uh School boards
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
transportation and instructions of
 
03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:04.670 align:start position:0%
transportation and instructions of
pupils

03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
pupils
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
so was it applied to different things I
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
mean I mean if if if it's hardship or
 
03:58:13.710 --> 03:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
you know and do do you understand what
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it seems to me why
 
03:58:20.349 --> 03:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
why why does it need to be in two places
 
03:58:20.359 --> 03:58:28.149 align:start position:0%
why why does it need to be in two places
I

03:58:28.149 --> 03:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
guess I think it was brought forward as
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
that technical correction to make sure
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the laws were consistent in the way
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
I view 189 col 1A the duty to provide
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
education is more kind of a a basic
 
03:58:42.600 --> 03:58:44.149 align:start position:0%
education is more kind of a a basic
overview

03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
overview
 
03:58:47.229 --> 03:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
it is a general statute um and when I
 
03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:58:51.110 --> 03:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
1933 that is more detailed the
 
03:58:54.149 --> 03:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
application of it but I don't
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
think I don't think it changes the
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
meaning of it I think it's consistent in
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
terms of striking the non- secretari so
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
that the two sections
 
03:59:07.790 --> 03:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
match followup sure um so so if I read
 
03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
it one is talking about the contract as
 
03:59:14.110 --> 03:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the ability to do it perhaps
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
I mean um the first part talks about the
 
03:59:19.950 --> 03:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the school boards to
 
03:59:23.229 --> 03:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
um uh have a contract within with a non-
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
secretary school and this one talks
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
about um again it seems to be just
 
03:59:31.469 --> 03:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
talking about allowing them to enter
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
into a um tuition agreement so it's same
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing one is general and one is
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
more detailed as to how it happens
 
03:59:44.640 --> 03:59:47.550 align:start position:0%
more detailed as to how it happens
is

03:59:47.550 --> 03:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't necessarily like that
 
03:59:53.149 --> 03:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
characterization represent
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm curious to know
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's the the actual word non
 
04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
sectarian that is uh being cleaned up or
 
04:00:08.990 --> 04:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
is there is there um disconnect between
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
what exists in con State constitutional
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
law and then the changes in the in the
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
RSA uh regarding payment for religious
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
entities I I do know
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
that um the state constitution still
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
talks about things uh with regard to
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
religious sex or denominations paying
 
04:00:33.750 --> 04:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
for certain services so I'm curious how
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
the removal of that word stands
 
04:00:40.910 --> 04:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe in conflict with what the state
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
constitution says
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
an interesting question without the
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
state constitution in front of me I I'm
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
not in a great position to kind of take
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
that deep dive answer and surprisingly I
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't have it memorized in my head um as
 
04:01:01.710 --> 04:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
some people think I I probably should um
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the best of my understanding the bill
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's brought before you in HB
 
04:01:09.229 --> 04:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
678 is is really just a a technical
 
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
correction Bill there was no discussion
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
about the implications of the state
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
in what's the word I'm looking for it
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
completely escaped my head but um there
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
was no discussion nor was there any
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
thought as to whether there was any
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
violation there it was just viewed as a
 
04:01:30.479 --> 04:01:32.269 align:start position:0%
violation there it was just viewed as a
technical

04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
technical
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
correction represent
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:01:39.790 --> 04:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us so is it your
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that this bill does
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to change current statute but
 
04:01:46.349 --> 04:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
instead codifies the language that
 
04:01:48.910 --> 04:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
should have been matched from the first
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:01:59.950 --> 04:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
you attorney Fenton for taking my
 
04:01:59.960 --> 04:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
you attorney Fenton for taking my
question

04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
um so in reading this and I don't and I
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if this if I'm even allowed
 
04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
to ask this question so you can stop me
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
but um is it if we don't correct this
 
04:02:14.750 --> 04:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
will it hold up in a court of law
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
I feel like that's what I feel like
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of why I can't say it
 
04:02:20.040 --> 04:02:22.469 align:start position:0%
that's kind of why I can't say it
but

04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that is kind of the natural
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
piggyback to representative woodcock's
 
04:02:29.790 --> 04:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
question um and and again it would just
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
go into statutary interpretation and
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
statutory history as to what the
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislature intended exactly with that
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
change right thank
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm going back to uh on the amended
 
04:02:51.630 --> 04:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
section the six on six so is this is it
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
just the first uh line for my clarity um
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
on page 540 that you referenced it to in
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
the small print okay so is this bill
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
only specific if there is
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
no if there's no public school with
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:17.469 --> 04:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
that's what RSA 1933 is talking about
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
on yes I just want to be really clear so
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
the only this the application
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
disregarding the the dialogue today
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
about nonsectarian the application
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
specifically is only for a school system
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't have that grade in the
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
public school system is that
 
04:03:42.149 --> 04:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
correct that's what 1933 talks about but
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
I think that if you if you put the
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
statutes together again my understanding
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
in working with the sponsor of this bill
 
04:03:52.030 --> 04:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
this is a technical correction
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill and I think the sponsor me um the
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor put it best is that this really
 
04:04:01.469 --> 04:04:01.479 align:start position:0%
is a straightforward bill this was
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
always intended to be a technical
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
correction Bill and 1891 a is that
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
General provision right which then
 
04:04:10.920 --> 04:04:12.269 align:start position:0%
General provision right which then
allows

04:04:12.269 --> 04:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
allows
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
1933 to go into detail about what that
 
04:04:18.349 --> 04:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
detailed examples I hope that helps
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
clarify it a little
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
bit all right but again I would just uh
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to look at that
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
history in the amendment section because
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.830 --> 04:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively see no further questions
 
04:04:40.149 --> 04:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much was there anyone
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
else who wish to
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
testify uh see none
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%

like to speak so um since this is a
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
continuation of the hearing um we'll
 
04:16:45.309 --> 04:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to three minutes uh per
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
person and we will start with
 
04:16:47.279 --> 04:16:49.189 align:start position:0%

be dealing with the uh amended Amendment
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's been placed placed
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%

was introduced so we can speak to the
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%

again I've been for those that don't
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
know I used to be on education committee
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
for 12 years and I decided I needed a
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
rest anyway some years ago I introduced
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
the bill to put a rain in on
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys parents had to be
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
notified in questions provided first
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill was flopped out then it was later
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
change oped in Bill finally passed and
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's now law and then as multiple tries
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
to change it arguments in that sub that
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools in some cases get money for
 
04:18:29.790 --> 04:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
doing the survey selling student
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
information for money I guess is okay
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
for some the youth risk behavior survey
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
was left
 
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
in to be opt in this survey is taken as
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
a joke by most high school students
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
when I was on the school board this was
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
giving in given in a high school and I
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
heard from my spies that the students
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
were taking this as a class project for
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
example how many times do we get drunk
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
married does your boyfriend hit you do
 
04:19:00.910 --> 04:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
you take drugs etc etc some Weeks Later
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
a principal came to our school board
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
meeting with the disastrous results I
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
then informed him how the survey was
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
taken the student School Board member
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
verified this this other schools have
 
04:19:16.510 --> 04:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
the same issues when they know the
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
survey is being taken social media goes
 
04:19:21.389 --> 04:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
rampant with entries on how to answer
 
04:19:24.510 --> 04:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
the questions also parents need to know
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
what their children are being asked
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights all questions on surveys
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
must be given to the parents which I
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
believe this bill does so they can make
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
decision to allow their child to take
 
04:19:38.349 --> 04:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
the survey over the years we've heard
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
argument that parents do not get
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
permission slips from the survey of do
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
not opt in interesting parents have to
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
give an op in for field trips etc those
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be returned parents don't opt in
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
because they don't want the child to
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
take it also nowadays this is also being
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
done electronically emails Etc to
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
parents also sexual questions how many
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
high school students will answer they
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
are not sexually active do any any of
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
you remember when you were in high
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
school these surveys are a joke then
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are suicide question so let's put
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
the that in the St in the students Minds
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
also now some may testify to the survey
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
and others are all academic is the
 
04:20:23.950 --> 04:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
schools responsible to teach not be
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
social workers also the
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
test test states that it is anonymous
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
the first seven questions can easily
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
show who the student is that if they
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
answer correctly and again students take
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
this as a joke a parent testified some
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
years ago stating that his son and
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
others stated that they were all 200 lb
 
04:20:45.680 --> 04:20:47.269 align:start position:0%
others stated that they were all 200 lb
black

04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
black
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
females now it's been proven time out of
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
time that I mean remember the survey
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
done by the CDC and depending on what
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
administration has in power questions do
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
become political in the past there were
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
questions on guns in home now I bet
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
there will be questions on vaccinations
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
another argument that they need to Tire
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
school to take the survey to get the
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
full results what's the difference
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
student answering at a joke or not
 
04:21:18.670 --> 04:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
answering at all and I remember an old
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
software engineer thing engineering
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
question garbage in garbage out I also
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
did statistics and what good is a
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
statistic if you don't have good results
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%

446 446 excuse me uh as written this is
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
not my first appearance here to talk
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
about the yrbs and whereas the uh
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment seems to be more generic in
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
nature uh we certainly realize that it's
 
04:23:09.790 --> 04:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
talking about specific issues as well um
 
04:23:11.389 --> 04:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit confused as to why
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's such oppositions to learning as
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
much as we can about our children that's
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
our responsibility as parents and
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
contrary to what uh the sponsor just
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
testified to that was not our experience
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
in Franklin for example we found that
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
people were very serious about this um
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's a bonified effort quite frankly uh
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
in an e in order to learn about the
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
habits and beliefs and thoughts of our
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
children uh in his noninvasive way as
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
possible and frankly the the yrbs only
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
looks at six particular categor ories it
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
looks at behaviors that contribute to
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
unint unintentional injuries and
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
violence sexual behaviors of our
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
children that may contribute to
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancies and sexually
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
transmitted diseases including HIV
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug use tobacco use
 
04:24:00.670 --> 04:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
unhealthy dietary behaviors and
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
inadequate physical activity all things
 
04:24:04.429 --> 04:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
that we want our children to avoid if
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
they can and if we know more about it we
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
can certainly deal with that um this is
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
not a question of putting objection a
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
reading material into a school library
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
as seems to be happening throughout the
 
04:24:18.349 --> 04:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
country we're actually doing this is
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually being conducted in a very uh
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
proper and uh specific way it's a
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
Bonafide effort to learn about the
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
habits and thoughts and beliefs of our
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
children in fact from a public health
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
point of view and I have a masters in
 
04:24:35.790 --> 04:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
public health this is considered primary
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
prevention we want to know before the
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
diseases affect our children before the
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
behaviors affect our children we want to
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and that is how
 
04:24:46.030 --> 04:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health Works if you looked at it
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
as if they were smoking we would try to
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
keep people from Ever picking up a
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
cigarette and then not have to worry
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
about the uh the uh results of that so
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
this is a similar type of thing to that
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is longitudinal type of research
 
04:25:01.149 --> 04:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement in any way shape
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
or form that a student has to
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
participate and if is or her parents
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't want them to they don't have to
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the student doesn't even have to
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
answer the question it is strictly
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary the data however does assist
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
in in gathering evidence-based data uh
 
04:25:17.109 --> 04:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
that we can use for such initiatives as
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
grants in the case of Franklin for
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
example in 2010 we initiated what we
 
04:25:24.510 --> 04:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
call the U Franklin mayor drug task
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
force uh and this was aimed at drug use
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
among our students uh if you Mr C if you
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
could wrap up please uh yes sir uh just
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
to let you know that with that kind of
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
data the city of Franklin received
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollars in Grants over 15
 
04:25:42.000 --> 04:25:43.109 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollars in Grants over 15
years

04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
we received drug free communities grants
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
which department which cities did not
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
get their first try and we did I would
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
merely ask that you think of it in terms
 
04:25:54.670 --> 04:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
of what it's meant to do and I uh again
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
we ask you to it all this and I'm happy
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here uh
 
04:26:03.710 --> 04:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative Dr thank you and thank
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I've been
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
trying to find a lot of the answers that
 
04:26:08.790 --> 04:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
of things that you've talked about yes
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
ma' can you tell me and I could not get
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
an answer to this how
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
how this survey helps direct money and
 
04:26:19.229 --> 04:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
how who benefits does it go through DC
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the federal government are you
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the survey's money itself
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
or to use the survey for to use the
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
survey for again any Grant process
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
requires that we lay out in specificity
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do with the money
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
and what the grant is aimed at such as
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
our drug free communities Grant was in
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
Franklin we were able to do that uh it
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
is a very involved process and by having
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
this evidence based data we could show
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
that so many percentage of students
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
thought this versus so many percentage
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
of students thought that uh about these
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
six particular categories and that's how
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
we were able to toh receive those
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
funds yes another question I could not
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
find an answer for was uh we asked if
 
04:27:05.070 --> 04:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
this was an opt out opt in instead of
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
opt out is there a certain number of
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
surveys like a a yeah exact threshold
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to be to be a Dependable
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
survey uh well there's the more you can
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
get the better in any survey research
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we understand that usually
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
around a third of the respondents is
 
04:27:26.830 --> 04:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for to have any kind
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
of meaning whatsoever but we still
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
report the numbers as they come in uh as
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
far as opt-in versus opt out is
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
concerned I'm a parent I don't know how
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
many times I had to go through book bags
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
to find out what I was missing uh
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
because I was supposed to opt in and my
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
children for got to give me the note
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the teacher so to speak so this way
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
as an opt out uh it works a little bit
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
better and that also doesn't preclude
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
parents from going online if parents
 
04:27:54.189 --> 04:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
want to know what the yrbs is and I did
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
this just before I came just to make
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
sure it's still valid I put yrbs in the
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
Google search line everything you want
 
04:28:02.109 --> 04:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
to know is right there the numbers are
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
there the questions are there there's
 
04:28:05.469 --> 04:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
nothing hidden in this this type of
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
thing but I'm not sure if that answers
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
your question but again the bottom line
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
is the more the better okay thank you
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Woodcock
 
04:28:16.990 --> 04:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon sir thank you
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
for being here my pleasure um
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the sample size um
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
would diminish if it became an
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
opin um how imper is for the prevention
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
model to have the largest uh pool for
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
statistical research it's incredibly
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
imperative uh I'll give you an example
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
from my own survey research that I
 
04:28:44.670 --> 04:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
conducted at the VA hospital in Boston
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
on uh veterans who were hospitalized who
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
had chronic obstructive pulmonary
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
disease and were continuing to smoke and
 
04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
my hypothesis was uh is that in sense in
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
a very real sense self-destructive
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior you've been diagnosed with
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
empyema cancer what have you um and
 
04:29:03.990 --> 04:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
using a survey and the what's as the
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
mmpi the Minnesota multiphasic inventory
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
which is a personality it has a subtest
 
04:29:12.189 --> 04:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
I was able to show statistically that in
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
fact uh that is considered a
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
self-destruction so the more the better
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
again okay uh for preventative measures
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
and again Public Health looks at Prime
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
prevention in anywhere between three and
 
04:29:25.109 --> 04:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
five levels the very simplest is three
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
primary prevention is stopping the
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
problem before it ever becomes a problem
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't smoke right period then you won't
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
get cancer emphas whatever and that's
 
04:29:35.070 --> 04:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
all thank you um in your in your um
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
program in Franklin your hometown um
 
04:29:45.990 --> 04:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
was there post research done to validate
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
the the uh Grant actually uh yes we
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
continue we had to that was part of the
 
04:29:53.070 --> 04:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
grant we also went so far as to go down
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
to Middle School uh in Franklin we took
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
it upon ourselves to do that and again
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
we got what we felt with some very
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
viable and legitimate responses thank
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair repr represent
 
04:30:07.469 --> 04:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us my pleasure
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
you you you made a comment and I can I
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
can definitely um relate to it about
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
when your kids were in school and you
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
had to fish around to the bottom of
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
their backpack to get the permission
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
slips I'm just curious why is this the
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
only only piece of information that
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
parents have to opt out of as opposed to
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
opt in when field trips even have to be
 
04:30:37.630 --> 04:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
opted in on can do you you have any you
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
know any feelings or reasoning behind
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
that again as representative brought up
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
numbers would go down numbers would go
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
down with opt in versus opt down a
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir yes thank you um do you
 
04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
have any empirical evidence of
 
04:30:55.389 --> 04:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
that um right off the top of my head no
 
04:30:59.790 --> 04:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
I just experience with it thank you R
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr Sharon thank you for
 
04:31:03.790 --> 04:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm curious to know
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not um the aggregate data
 
04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
that is is received you spoke with
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
respect to Franklin I understand that
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
but uh might the data um inform
 
04:31:17.469 --> 04:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
decisions uh differently based on the
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
region of uh even the state of where
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
kids are based on lived
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
experiences you mean for example
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
geographically for example sure well
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
even socioeconomically I would never be
 
04:31:31.229 --> 04:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
so bold to say that that wouldn't be a
 
04:31:31.239 --> 04:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
so bold to say that that wouldn't be a
contributing

04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
factor further questions see none thank
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members Aubrey
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
Friedman Bridgewater I speak in support
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill um most parents I think
 
04:32:01.950 --> 04:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's heard about the the youth
 
04:32:03.630 --> 04:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
Behavior whis you know the survey
 
04:32:05.630 --> 04:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
everybody knows about it but to actually
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
open it up and look at the questions I
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that many parents have done
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
it sure you can go on on online and do
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
it I don't think they do it this bill
 
04:32:17.070 --> 04:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
will make it so it's emailed to the
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
parents now that doesn't mean people
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
ignore emails people don't open emails
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
that could still happen but I do think
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
that a lot more people would actually
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
look at the questions and you know they
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
they're extremely nosy they're not as
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
bad as they used to be I've railed
 
04:32:36.269 --> 04:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
against this particular survey for years
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and actually in our own School District
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
they uh they just recently did it in the
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
Middle School there was I was railing
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
against it there in a Schoolboard
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and they had actually modified
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
it a little bit so the requirements of
 
04:32:52.670 --> 04:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill are just that it's to be
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
emailed they probably already have an
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
email list for all the families so you
 
04:33:00.109 --> 04:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
just type a little brief two or three
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
sentences you know here's the survey
 
04:33:04.269 --> 04:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it in 10 days you
 
04:33:06.750 --> 04:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
attach the survey and you hit send I
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
mean there's no Financial note to this
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill the administrative B would be
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
probably 10 minutes and You' sent it and
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it and the only my
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
only problem with this bill actually is
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a penalty what happens
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
if the school district just doesn't do
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
it a bill has to have teeth in it and I
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
have seen several times in our own
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
School District new found that the
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
school board does not follow the law so
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
there should be some type of a penalty
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
and the bill is good the idea is good
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
but they do some school districts do not
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
comply with the law and there should be
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
teeth in it so um that's it I support
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
the bill with um some type of a penalty
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
or whatever because for to make the uh
 
04:33:52.750 --> 04:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
parents or with taxpayers you have to go
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
to the MS budsman or the uh state board
 
04:34:00.670 --> 04:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know Board of Education
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
to complain about it or the Attorney
 
04:34:04.109 --> 04:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
General there should be teeth in the
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill and that's that's it I support the
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you represent
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you uh thank you Mr fre
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%

you always bring a perspective I love to
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
think about uh in the amendment you know
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the amendment right
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay um I haven't seen the amendment so
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
know do you understand this
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
requires written consent this is not
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
review it's not the parent sayings okay
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
this Rees written consent the email the
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
POR you were talking about sending out
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
to the parents we're going to do this um
 
04:34:47.629 --> 04:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
is a nice advanced piece I got that but
 
04:34:47.639 --> 04:34:48.670 align:start position:0%
is a nice advanced piece I got that but
to

04:34:48.670 --> 04:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
participate the parent has to get back
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
and say yes so as if they're as busy as
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
you say they are and they may not have a
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
chance what happens to the the the data
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
for future St student prevention without
 
04:35:04.750 --> 04:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
the parent opting without parent getting
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
back well if the parent doesn't get back
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
then the kid doesn't participate in the
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
survey and I consider that a good thing
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
that school should be for teaching and
 
04:35:15.789 --> 04:35:15.799 align:start position:0%
not being for Gathering data so I
 
04:35:17.949 --> 04:35:17.959 align:start position:0%
consider that a good thing actually that
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
446 um we have serious concerns about uh
 
04:36:16.590 --> 04:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to collect viable data if
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
this survey were be were to be turned
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
into an optin model as opposed to an opt
 
04:36:23.789 --> 04:36:23.799 align:start position:0%
out model um currently there are many
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
prevention programs mental health
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
programs um student support programs
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
that rely on yrbs data not only for
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
those uh important grants that you've
 
04:36:35.470 --> 04:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
heard about today and will continue to
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
hear about um but also for just general
 
04:36:41.310 --> 04:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
student wellness in schools a lot of
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
times schools will rely on ybs data to
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that students are allow are able
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
to have the support they need to be most
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
productive and most successful in their
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
academic careers um for instance
 
04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
bullying is a really important um topic
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
of conversation these days and the ybs
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
is able to gather data on whether or not
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
students are facing violence in schools
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
or feel safe in their schools um when
 
04:37:07.709 --> 04:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
students feel safe they're able to
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
succeed academically the most it also uh
 
04:37:14.189 --> 04:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
asks is about um mental health of
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
students which is really important to be
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
able to understand how students are
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
doing and again able to contribute to
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
their academic
 
04:37:26.429 --> 04:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
success um I'll also just note that the
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
ybs data is completely Anonymous and
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
completely voluntary there is data to
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
show that students do take this survey
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
seriously um year over-year the data is
 
04:37:41.470 --> 04:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
collected um it's analyzed and compared
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
compared to previous years so that we're
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
able to see Trends and those Trends are
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
able to indicate that the data is valid
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
and reliable year-over-year so while you
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
may have a student here or there not
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
take this survey seriously students do
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
generally take this survey very
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
seriously and actually appreciate the
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use it as a tool to ask
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
for help when they need
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
it um and I will finally just clarify my
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony is going around but
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%

04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%

04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
it today but wanted to share their
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
perspective as well um I'll close and uh
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
questions does anyone else who need a

dry thank you and maybe you're the qu
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
person to ask this question of as well
 
04:39:00.910 --> 04:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
um still trying to get a handle on what
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
you think the difference would be if
 
04:39:05.310 --> 04:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is so popular with the students if
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
they had to opt in rather than opt out
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
what is is there a threshold of number
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
of responses that you have to get in
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
order to make a good data reliable
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
survey I am not a data person so I don't
 
04:39:20.590 --> 04:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
have that number off the top of my head
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
I believe there are better people better
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
equipped in the audience to answer that
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
question sorry I can't get it to you
 
04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay follow follow up yes okay do you
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
thank you then maybe a philosophical
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
question how does the
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
Data Drive money for Grants and things
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
like that how is that tied together so
 
04:39:43.230 --> 04:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
with um as Chief Goldstein mentioned
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
grants both federal state and private
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
grants almost across the board need
 
04:39:53.708 --> 04:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
Baseline and Trend data to determine one
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
where your starting point is and then is
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
the thing you're trying to implement
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
working is the are the grant dollars
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
being used effectively so you in order
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
to get the Grant have to show that there
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
is a need using that Baseline data from
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
the ybs in this instance and then to
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
show that you were effectively using
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
those Grant dollars and may be applying
 
04:40:15.868 --> 04:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
for additional Grant dollars um to
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
continue your program have to show that
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
the trend is in your favor using the ybs
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
data over several years um this survey
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
is given every two years so we have um
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
pretty good continuous data to show that
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
okay in year one students were really
 
04:40:33.150 --> 04:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
having a problem with bullying on campus
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
they weren't feeling safe we implemented
 
04:40:37.628 --> 04:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
an anti-bullying campaign using Grant
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and now in year four we're
 
04:40:41.628 --> 04:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
seeing that more students are reporting
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they're feeling safe on campus and
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
feeling prepared to learn and succeed
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
academically because of that so the
 
04:40:48.510 --> 04:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
grant dollars were used
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
effectively thank you further questions
 
04:40:51.840 --> 04:40:53.310 align:start position:0%
effectively thank you further questions
represent

04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
kuger thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
to try to understand so would that data
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
then come back to school administrators
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
so you would see the results within that
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
school district not just a Statewide
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
data yes I believe the data is broken
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
out by um County in New Hampshire and
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
then um perhaps the department would be
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer the nuances of
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
exactly who has access um to school and
 
04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
District level level data but my
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the data is
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
aggregated specifically to can keep
 
04:41:30.430 --> 04:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
anonymity of the uh respondents thank
 
04:41:32.430 --> 04:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
you rent
 
04:41:34.510 --> 04:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:41:36.750 --> 04:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you know how
 
04:41:38.670 --> 04:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
many years this survey has been
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
administered in New Hampshire um in New
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know the number off
 
04:41:45.550 --> 04:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
the top of my head um but I do know that
 
04:41:48.270 --> 04:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
the survey has been administered um
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
nationally and I believe New Hampshire
 
04:41:51.150 --> 04:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
has been a participant for several
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
decades at at this
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
point follow several decades at 70
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
years several several several Dees not
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
seven sorry I have a cold so I might not
 
04:42:07.708 --> 04:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
be most understandable
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
today thank where woodcock
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for for
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
being here um have you have a CH have
 
04:42:18.270 --> 04:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
you had this a followup question coming
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance to look at the
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I have yes thank you so if I
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
may see the part that um first all I
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
think the ybs I think it's critical uh
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
having been a health teacher I think
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
it's without question critical but the
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the amendment in my mind seems
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
to have changed drastically where
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
initially the they was emailing
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
notification and opt in uh if we look at
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
line uh 16 and 17 as I read this it says
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
that the parents must send such surveys
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
through the email so that suggests to me
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
that that survey not may or may not be
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
filled out by the student this is not an
 
04:43:03.628 --> 04:43:03.638 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt out if you look at 1617 this
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
now requires the survey in itself to be
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
sent to the parent do you read it that
 
04:43:12.910 --> 04:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
same way
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting reading I hadn't
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
read it that way but I I now that I you
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
say it I do believe that is a a
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
potential reading it could be a problem
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
May fa thank it doesn't say permission
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
to take it says send the survey I can't
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
think of any survey we're trying or
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
anything we trying reliable adult or
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
reliable data by sending it out in
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
advance um to to a different group
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's taking the
 
04:43:41.800 --> 04:43:41.810 align:start position:0%
survey thank you Mr chair Murray
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:42.990 align:start position:0%
survey thank you Mr chair Murray
[Music]

04:43:42.990 --> 04:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions I am curious I I
 
04:43:50.590 --> 04:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak to the uh sponsors
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
intent I think there might be a typo in
 
04:43:56.430 --> 04:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
there um to some degree but I am curious
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
what should happen in the event that a
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian does not have email
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
um because it says that they shall do it
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
through email and other so is that the
 
04:44:09.708 --> 04:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
first step and then if somebody does not
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
receive it how what
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
then is that a requirement so sorry no
 
04:44:18.190 --> 04:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
so I didn't mean to cut you off thank
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
you for your question I um it's my
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that as I read it this
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
would include both email and any
 
04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
additional means of delivery the
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
district deems appropriate so I don't
 
04:44:32.110 --> 04:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
know who would be making that
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
determination I assume the school board
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how that determination
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be made so that's a bit vague I
 
04:44:39.310 --> 04:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
also know that there are lots of schools
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
who have transitioned to an app as a
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
common way of communicating with parents
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
which is not necessarily noted in this
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
so it might make it confusing for
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
parents who are typically looking at an
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
app to communicate with the teacher and
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
then they're getting emails about this
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that also May create some like Lost
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.708 --> 04:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
issues follow up thank you and the
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions correct me if I'm wrong the
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
questions are already required to be on
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
the district website is that correct
 
04:45:12.190 --> 04:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank you
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hawkins good afternoon thank you for the
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today for the
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
record my name is Sam Hawkins uh I'm
 
04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
here today representing Nami New
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the National Alliance on
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
Mental Illness uh in opposition to any
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendments that would make uh the ybs
 
04:45:43.948 --> 04:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
and opt in uh to be clear we do fully
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
believe that parents should receive
 
04:45:47.230 --> 04:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
notice of non-academic surveys they
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to review their
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
contents and they should have the choice
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
to opt their student out but we are
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to the policies that would make
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
the survey an opt in for the simple
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
reason that busy parents may miss the
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
notice regarding the yrbs due to their
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
busy lives uh disallowing their children
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
to participate even if the parent would
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise actually encourage that
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
participation um you've heard and we
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
also believe that this opt-in
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
requirement will make it nearly
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
impossible to obtain uh statistically
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
valid results which will hinder the
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
state's uh prevention intervention and
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
postvention efforts uh I want to take
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
more time to address a concern that is
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
often raised surrounding the ybs and
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is that asking youth about their
 
04:46:28.628 --> 04:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
mental health asking youth about suicide
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
will contribute to those very same
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
negative mental health outcomes we
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
firmly uh disagree with this position
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
and believe that that position is rooted
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the same stigma surrounding mental
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
health and suicide that has for so long
 
04:46:44.430 --> 04:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh led to people not seeking the care
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
they need we instead believe that when
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
we openly and responsibly speak about
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
mental health and suicide we can
 
04:46:52.590 --> 04:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate that stigma and encourage all
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
people to reach out and ask for help it
 
04:46:56.548 --> 04:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
is in this way that the ybs can actually
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
be a valuable tool it can open up honest
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
conversations about mental health and
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
suicide for youth so they can feel
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable going to their family and
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
speaking about the help they need um I
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
would just say that um uh if you hear of
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
any perceived or anecdotal increase in
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
negative mental health outcomes or
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
suicidality following someone taking the
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
ybs I would not say that it is the ybs
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
causing that but rather it is uh that
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
elimination of stigma that opening of
 
04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
the conversation that is encouraging
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
that student to talk about the
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
challenges they are facing and I also
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to go back and say that again uh
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
just because a child is not opted out
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they have to take it if
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
they have an emotional response to a
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
question they can stop at any time uh in
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
closing I just want to emphasize again
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
that the wire RBS is safe it doesn't
 
04:47:45.070 --> 04:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
encourage risky Behavior or contribute
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
to negative mental health outcomes for
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
Youth and it's crucial for our state as
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
such the quality of the results must be
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
maintained and I thank you for your time
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you maybe you are the quite
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
person to ask about this because I'm
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
still trying to get a hand on the
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
statistically valid uh parts of it you
 
04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
said it would be nearly impossible to
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
get statistically valued results what's
 
04:48:11.788 --> 04:48:11.798 align:start position:0%
the threshold that you're looking for do
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
you have a a ballpark a number I I
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm I'm a liberal arts student
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
not a data Wiz I'm going to Kick the Can
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
to the department and hopefully they are
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question for you but
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
I do think it's a valuable question
 
04:48:26.190 --> 04:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent represent
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you Mr Shon thanks for
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um mental health is
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
such an important component of what we
 
04:48:38.430 --> 04:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
um what we do here as a a group of
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislators for a myriad of different
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
areas of public policy so one of the my
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
questions to you is whether or not um
 
04:48:49.390 --> 04:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
data over time would also help um shape
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
mental health initiatives in uh
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
counties through mental health services
 
04:48:58.350 --> 04:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
at your local or Regional Mental Health
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
Centers yeah thank you for the question
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
I think um data is incredibly valuable
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
in all the ways we try and bolster the
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
state's um prevention intervention
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
postvention efforts I mean I've filled
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
out a couple grants in my my time a
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
question you see on practically every
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
Grant even the easiest Grant is what is
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
the need what problem are we solving uh
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's great to be able to say here's what
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
we see at a national level it's even
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
better to say here's what we're seeing
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the local level not just at the state
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
in the county um and even beyond that I
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely I think organizations
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
providers can use that data to get
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
grants to uh go to funders to seek
 
04:49:35.910 --> 04:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
funding for their services but I think
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
also it's a valuable tool for the
 
04:49:39.548 --> 04:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
legislature for people to come in front
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
of all of you be able to say here's this
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
great thing you did a couple years ago
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and here's we're actually seeing these
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
numbers go down or here's where we need
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
to maybe adjust what we did um so I
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
think it's valuable in many ways thank
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
you follow up quickly please thank you
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
um and with regard to early intervention
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
um getting ahead of costly expenses is
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
is there any value to the data being
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
collected now uh to get ahead of an
 
04:50:10.350 --> 04:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
issue that might be developing yeah I um
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's sort of uh complex in
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the way there will be um youth who
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
are sort of at all stages of um their
 
04:50:20.190 --> 04:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
mental health Journey if they're facing
 
04:50:22.270 --> 04:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges um but I do
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
think one thing we strongly believe is
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
that when people get the care they need
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
in their community at the time that they
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
need it we avoid crisis you know every
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
day there are kids waiting in the
 
04:50:35.310 --> 04:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
emergency department for inpatient care
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
if that child feels comfortable um and
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
encouraged to open up about a maybe less
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
severe um Mental Health Challenge um
 
04:50:47.390 --> 04:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
before it reaches a crisis Point um I
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
think that that could decrease uh the
 
04:50:52.830 --> 04:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
higher Acuity of care that we are seeing
 
04:50:56.548 --> 04:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
being utilized thank you R
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
LF thank you Mr chairman I just wanted
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
to ask you are we discussing the
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
benefits or negatives of the youth risk
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
behavior survey or are we discussing the
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.150 --> 04:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the uh we're
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
discussing the the amendment um but uh
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
the need um for opt in versus opt out I
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
think is a valid question thank
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
you represent Freeman did you have a
 
04:51:30.670 --> 04:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you Mr chair and
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
after a student complain and and I know
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
you'll answer this to the best of your
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
ability after a student completes a
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
survey and that student may express some
 
04:51:45.480 --> 04:51:46.990 align:start position:0%
survey and that student may express some
severe

04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
severe
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
suicidality how does that information
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
get passed on to a person that would be
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to address that immediately with
 
04:51:54.000 --> 04:51:54.788 align:start position:0%
able to address that immediately with
the

04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:59.310 --> 04:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
survey I appreciate the question um uh I
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
think what you're getting at um is is an
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
important issue and it's sort of
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
balancing the key priorities of we all
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
agree that this survey should be
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
anonymous we also agree that kids uh who
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
are in Mental Health crisis need help as
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
soon as possible um I think it would
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
undermine the important Anon anonymity
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
of the survey to have a pipeline where
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
if someone answers a certain question a
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
certain way they are then linked to
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
resources but I do think that is why we
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
need to build up Community Resources in
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
the school in the community at large
 
04:52:32.670 --> 04:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
that are reaching out early thank you
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
yes represent morrris thank you Mr chair
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question kind of
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
a piggyback off hers and with what you
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
just said representative Freeman sorry
 
04:52:45.070 --> 04:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you'd be looking
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
to get the individual support but if
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's so Anonymous then how exactly would
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
that work right uh thank you for your
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
question um again the ybs is not a
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
screening tool um well I mean it is a
 
04:52:59.708 --> 04:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
survey in the way that we are trying to
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
gather data about where our youth are at
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
it is not a diagnostic clinical
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
screening Tool uh that is intended to
 
04:53:08.830 --> 04:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
immediately get people into treatment
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
but what we do know uh as an
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
organization is that uh and this is
 
04:53:17.230 --> 04:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
really just a core tenant of um suicide
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
prevention is having those open
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions encourages people to seek help
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
just being asked that question of are
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
you feeling sad or hopeless are you
 
04:53:27.320 --> 04:53:28.670 align:start position:0%
you feeling sad or hopeless are you
feeling

04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
suicidal that will encourage people to
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
go to their parents to have those
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
conversations to seek help if they need
 
04:53:38.190 --> 04:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
it so while there is not a uh direct
 
04:53:40.110 --> 04:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
link from you answer this to get into
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
treatment I do think there is um a
 
04:53:43.868 --> 04:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
culture around having these
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
conversations that does connect people
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
to the care they need and we've heard
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
that from our families our members um
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen it in my personal life thank
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
you follow up quickly I I got like a
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
million questions so I'm trying to kind
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
of narrow in here so where exactly does
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
the money come from for the grants when
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
the data is
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
collected uh thank you for your question
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh could you clarify what Grant
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
specifically you're talking about I
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
would say any and all sure I mean uh
 
04:54:12.750 --> 04:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
grants can come from uh the state they
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
can come nationally they can come from
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
private funders um really anyone that
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
has an interest in specific programs
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
that they would like to fund they will
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
put out grants um that uh people can
 
04:54:24.788 --> 04:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
apply for service providers
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
organizations can apply for um really
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
money Woodcock thank you good afternoon
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here I know it's not
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
easy afternoon um going back to the uh
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
aggregate data that you're implying that
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
we don't disaggregate by individual uh
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh person because that's not the intent
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
they nullify inent am I correct to
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
believe that the school systems get a
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
result of the agre data at the end uh
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh just of
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
clarification are you asking whether the
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
School receives school specific
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
information or student specific
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
information school specific
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
May yes scho school specific I I would
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh defer to the department on that one
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether it's broken out at
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
a school level okay you thank you thank
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%

Services what I
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
asked but you know in that
 
04:55:35.548 --> 04:55:35.558 align:start position:0%

I'm the legislative lison for the
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.708 --> 04:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm William Moyer I'm the
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
section administrator for the health
 
04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
statistics and data management section
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
at Department of Public Health and so I
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
do have the answer to the questions
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
about um what we need to make what CDC
 
04:56:37.948 --> 04:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
needs to have the surveys be
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative and the short answer is
 
04:56:44.110 --> 04:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
0% but the longer answer is that so the
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
ybs is typically offered to all public
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
high school students from that CDC
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
selects a sample of the schools
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
classrooms and students from which they
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
can make a representative
 
04:56:57.868 --> 04:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
sample the CDC will only consider the
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
sample to be sufficiently representative
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
if one of two criteria are met the first
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
criteria is an overall response rate of
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
60% which is basically they look at the
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
number of schools that participate out
 
04:57:09.868 --> 04:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
of the number of schools that they
 
04:57:11.670 --> 04:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
sample multipli by the number of
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
students that that participated in have
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
valid surveys out of the number of
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
students that were
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
sampled however starting in 2021 CDC um
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
made another criteria in response to
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
dropping participation rates which was
 
04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
resulting in many um States or other
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
localities not being able to get
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative results which means that
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get any of the survey data
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
back if I could just ask you to move the
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
mic a little closer yeah thank
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
you so second criteria is a non-response
 
04:57:44.430 --> 04:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
bias analysis which essentially is they
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
will compare the um students who
 
04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
participated with those who did not now
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
because they can't compare them on the
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
results of Interest they can they
 
04:57:54.030 --> 04:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
compare them on things such as for the
 
04:57:55.708 --> 04:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
schools the enrollment size if it's a
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
small medium or large school a poverty
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
measure which is usually the percentage
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
of students with free or reduced lunch
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the local type which would be Urban
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
Suburban or Rural and then look at the
 
04:58:07.470 --> 04:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
students and look at their the sex grade
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
and race and race and ethnicity if
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
responders and non-responders are
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
similar in all those categories CDC will
 
04:58:16.590 --> 04:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
say that the survey is still
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative and they will be able to
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
give you back
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
results um what I can also say is that
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
so for 2021 and 2023 in New Hampshire
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
our overall response rate was just
 
04:58:29.548 --> 04:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
around 65% so we did meet the criteria
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
but we were not that high above it um
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
and in terms of
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
um the effect of opt in versus opt out I
 
04:58:41.708 --> 04:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
can say that in New Jersey they have an
 
04:58:45.070 --> 04:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
opt in and in 2015 and 2017 they did not
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet the 60% criteria so New Jersey did
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
not get any ybs data for those years in
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2021 they also did not meet the
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
criteria in 2019 they had an overall
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
response rate of 49% in 2021 they had an
 
04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
overall response rate of
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
26% however due to the non-response bias
 
04:59:05.230 --> 04:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
CDC did determine that the results were
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative enough to give them
 
04:59:11.948 --> 04:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.190 --> 04:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh could do you want to we'll do it
 
04:59:15.910 --> 04:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
individually in terms of questions if
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
that is it okay represent dry thank you
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
so another statistical question these
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
are like weighted than the weighted
 
04:59:27.788 --> 04:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
values for this
 
04:59:29.788 --> 04:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
Statistics yeah so for the
 
04:59:32.350 --> 04:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative sample they basically use
 
04:59:34.270 --> 04:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
the principles the CDC uses principles
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
of survey design to wait each response
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
so that when you when they analyze it
 
04:59:40.750 --> 04:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
the results can be
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
you can infer from those results to the
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
overall population of high school
 
04:59:46.510 --> 04:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire follow follow
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I just looked at the chart of the
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
since like since 1991 and the the amount
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
that's been weighted has gone from 36%
 
04:59:53.638 --> 04:59:55.868 align:start position:0%
that's been weighted has gone from 36%
to

04:59:55.868 --> 04:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:00:00.990 --> 05:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
97.8% do you can you account for that um
 
05:00:03.430 --> 05:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
I don't not I'm not understanding okay
 
05:00:06.750 --> 05:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
so on the Y RBS website it talks about
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
the percent of the data that they wait
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
and it's gone from 30 6% that they do to
 
05:00:15.788 --> 05:00:15.798 align:start position:0%
90 almost 99% in the last two tests and
 
05:00:17.788 --> 05:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering are they waiting are
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
we getting less data and they're waiting
 
05:00:20.200 --> 05:00:22.510 align:start position:0%
we getting less data and they're waiting
more

05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:00:25.470 --> 05:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
things um You probably have to review it
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I would have to review that
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
okay I'd be happy to go into it thank
 
05:00:32.110 --> 05:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
you any further questions yes repres
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
Morris thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
thaning my question you just mentioned
 
05:00:38.070 --> 05:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
earlier that New Jersey didn't um get
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
enough statistics to get the data back
 
05:00:42.548 --> 05:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
so what happened from
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
that yeah so for 2015 and 2017 if you go
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
to their website where they give all the
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
reports there's nothing for those
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
years U so there may be nothing for
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
those years but what exactly does that
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
mean in essence I like what what were
 
05:01:02.670 --> 05:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
the consequences yes thanks sure so I
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
can speak to how New Hampshire uses the
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
data and so how that would impact us to
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
not have the statistical information
 
05:01:12.910 --> 05:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
like New Jersey as an example so because
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey is the
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
most reliable and valid data set that we
 
05:01:20.830 --> 05:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
have um in Behavioral Health we use the
 
05:01:22.830 --> 05:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
data to secure grants including our
 
05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
state opioid response Grant um our
 
05:01:28.708 --> 05:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention block grants
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
many other prevention treatment recovery
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
funding that help us to address
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
substance misuse in New Hampshire we
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
also utilize the funding to track
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
progress on the state's goals so how the
 
05:01:43.150 --> 05:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
the um children's system of care the
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
tenure Mental Health Plan how our
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers and
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
Regional public health networks are
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
responding to the needs of Youth in our
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
state we use it for our Suicide
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
Prevention plan and annual report we um
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
use it for the Governor's Commission on
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs action plan it's
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
really the way that we both are able to
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
to ask for funding for need it's the way
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
that we're able to flexibly respond to
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the to to have an understanding of the
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
of Youth that are obviously Ever
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
Changing um and then it's a way for us
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
to also track our progress our outcomes
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
time further questions see none um did
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
you oh I'm sorry represent Freeman
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:02:32.788 --> 05:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question how many years
 
05:02:34.590 --> 05:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
has this survey been given in New
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 1993 thank you so we
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
have additional statements just taking I
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
was I didn't know if you wanted to move
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
on to miss Roger so I just talked a
 
05:02:47.310 --> 05:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
little bit about the some of the ways
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
that we use this fun this um information
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
and Behavioral Health um so it the
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
opt-in in particular would be to have
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
these devastating consequences to us in
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
behavioral health because it would
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the participation and because we
 
05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
it allows us to better understand and
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
response to the needs of the youth
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
population um so the with Behavioral
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
Health much of the many mental health
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
conditions and substance use disorder
 
05:03:15.470 --> 05:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
can start in adolescence but they're
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
Progressive illnesses and so if the
 
05:03:20.350 --> 05:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
earlier that we are able to identify a
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
need and have intervention and begin
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
treatment the better the health outcomes
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
for these young people so it's
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
critically important that we have an
 
05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of what are the needs of
 
05:03:31.230 --> 05:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
our youth population so that we can
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
adapt our programming and our prevention
 
05:03:35.910 --> 05:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
to address those directly um the good
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
news is that these are treatable and
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
preventable challenges but we have to
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
know what's going on on the ground um so
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have to understand where we should
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
invest and how to monitor the population
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
level outcomes over time so again not
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
individual outcomes but understanding in
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
these grade levels how is this changing
 
05:03:57.070 --> 05:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
over time and so that we can respond to
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
those needs we also have youth who use
 
05:04:02.548 --> 05:04:02.558 align:start position:0%
this information themselves and are able
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
to do peer-to-peer um intervention and
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
prevention within their school Community
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
by understanding the social Norm forms
 
05:04:13.230 --> 05:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
and by promoting uh healthy and positive
 
05:04:15.788 --> 05:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
behaviors and so we know that we heard a
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about earlier um about The
 
05:04:20.670 --> 05:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
credibility of the data and do youth
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
take this seriously you'll probably hear
 
05:04:24.590 --> 05:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
from a number of Youth groups here today
 
05:04:26.270 --> 05:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
um that are working directly with young
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
people and I myself was a youth services
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
director for 15 years and so the youth
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
are actively using the data themselves
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the research tells us that this data
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
can be gathered from adolescence just as
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
credibly as it can from adults
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
and the the ybs does go through
 
05:04:44.190 --> 05:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
reliability checks to help identify the
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
small percentage of students who may
 
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
falsify answers so if that happens there
 
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
are uh an ways to reduce that um and the
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
other piece around that I wanted to
 
05:04:57.310 --> 05:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
address was some questions around sort
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
of planting the idea in children's heads
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
when we ask questions about mental
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
health and substance use and things like
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
that and there is no evidence that
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
simply asking students about health
 
05:05:08.670 --> 05:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
behaviors would encourage them to try
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
that behavior in fact in suicide
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
prevention I'm also uh certified in
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
National evidence-based Suicide
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
Prevention and we actually train people
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
to ask the question because it's often
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
met with a sense of relief so um it can
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden of carrying something
 
05:05:25.470 --> 05:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
scary or challenging alone and allow
 
05:05:27.628 --> 05:05:27.638 align:start position:0%
people to feel young people to feel seen
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
and respected uh so that they you know
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
when we ask young people about their
 
05:05:34.990 --> 05:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
mental health we don't teach them to be
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
unwell we actually learn the most they
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
actually learn the most critical step of
 
05:05:40.350 --> 05:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
taking care of ourselves which is being
 
05:05:42.350 --> 05:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
able to talk about it just like we would
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
for every other health issue um so this
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
is allowing us to both reduce the shame
 
05:05:50.430 --> 05:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
and stigma and open the door for finding
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
healthy um can take a few questions
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
questions yeah sure represent
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you for taking my
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you um to the department
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question do you know
 
05:06:07.120 --> 05:06:07.868 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question do you know
the

05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
percentages of um
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
programs who receive grants of all kinds
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
State local Federal um and how that
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
moving to an opt-in may impact those
 
05:06:20.110 --> 05:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
programs do you have any data about
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
roughly how many programs receive grants
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
it yeah I mean we utilize the block
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
grant funding the state opioid response
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
grant funding that the funding that I
 
05:06:31.548 --> 05:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
was mentioning in those opening remarks
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
in a number of ways in community and so
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
it would it would take a while to
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
catalog the ways that that funding is
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
being utilized today the state op
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
response Grant alone is $56
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
million um the other piece I just wanted
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
to mention is around um the the schools
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
being you know utilized for academics
 
05:06:55.470 --> 05:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
and just the Deep Impact that mental
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
health has on academic performance and
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
so having an understanding of this
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
information is critical to high
 
05:07:06.030 --> 05:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
performing schools in particular so
 
05:07:07.470 --> 05:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
mental health problems can affect a
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
student you know energy level their
 
05:07:09.000 --> 05:07:10.350 align:start position:0%
student you know energy level their
concentration

05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
concentration
 
05:07:12.830 --> 05:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and their optimism and it hinders
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
their performance so there's a direct
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
correlation here to addressing
 
05:07:20.430 --> 05:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and um having having
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges can you know is
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
associated with lower grade point
 
05:07:26.548 --> 05:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
averages and lower test scores and lower
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
engagement and and um attainment in
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
general in academics um I had a question
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned about data is been used
 
05:07:40.150 --> 05:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
in schools by youth in the school um how
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
is data from the surveys filtered by
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
school to provide to that school or
 
05:07:49.230 --> 05:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
School District do you want to speak to
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
that more
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
specifically yeah so often I think
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
students will use either the Statewide
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
results or also we provide reports that
 
05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
are by Public Health Region um and this
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
reminds me that in terms of what the
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
schools get we do provide reports back
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent that gives results
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
for their school this is not the
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
representative results it's just results
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate results for all the students
 
05:08:11.708 --> 05:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
have the each school that took it for
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
those reports we will suppress if it's
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
small numbers I believe it's there has
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
to be at least 20 students for each
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
question we give if there's less than
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
that we'll suppress the results to
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
protect the privacy and confidentiality
 
05:08:23.948 --> 05:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to the superintendent
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
whether they would release those reports
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
to students or anyone else or just keep
 
05:08:30.548 --> 05:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
them for themselves um if you could
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
repeat the number um that you used to um
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
filter the um privacy I believe it's 20
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I don't remember exactly
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
that but it's somewhere around there
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you morrris thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh so some
 
05:08:49.150 --> 05:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
of the grants that are mentioned earlier
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
is this more for Community Based or more
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
like in school I guess I could try to
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
elaborate more um like grants for Mental
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors to be brought into the
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
schools the funding the funding that has
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
been mentioned is used in a variety of
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
ways it's also that the department is
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
not the only the Department of Health
 
05:09:09.548 --> 05:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is not the only state
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
holder utilizing the results so you'll
 
05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
hear from local coalitions youth groups
 
05:09:17.430 --> 05:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
that are utilizing ybs data for their
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
region to understand what the needs are
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
in their locality and apply for
 
05:09:23.310 --> 05:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
additional grants that may be through
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
philanthropy or some other not you know
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
not federal to State funding which is
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
what I was speaking to um they'll
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
they're also the Department of Education
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
is using them in in order order to the
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
results as well in order to address
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
needs within their school that might be
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
other forms of federal uh funding that I
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
did not
 
05:09:45.548 --> 05:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
mention we Woodcock thank you chairman
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and and I just want I
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear sir on it wasn't you it was
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
me I couldn't hear right um I just want
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm
 
05:09:56.830 --> 05:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
clear you said that the
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
data um for each school or school
 
05:10:03.548 --> 05:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
system would be disaggregated to the
 
05:10:05.788 --> 05:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
extent that the super make clear that
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendent at least have an
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
overview of how his school responded how
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct before that was
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
different from we heard earlier in the
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
conversation not from you from another
 
05:10:18.750 --> 05:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
person that's correct we provide the
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
aggregate reports fact to the
 
05:10:22.750 --> 05:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent before each School follow
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and I I appreciate that
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
because we heard something different
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
before that was the point I was trying
 
05:10:30.628 --> 05:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
to get to um since you're using a uh if
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong stop me I think you said a
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
minimum 60% response rate so if we have
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
the response rate the superintendent
 
05:10:39.788 --> 05:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
gets it is it would seem to me that this
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
this particular survey the ybs is
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
critical because that allows that school
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
to say you know what we can see a trend
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
in what's changing in our school perhaps
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
we should supplement services in this
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
area or that area or would that be a
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
fair guesstimation from my part I
 
05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
believe so one corre is that the 60% is
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the overall Statewide and Public
 
05:11:07.150 --> 05:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
Health Region results which are
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative the school reports are
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
not weighted so it's just the students
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
that took the survey that day so okay
 
05:11:14.548 --> 05:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
the big caveat is that it may or may not
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
be representative if a school has a high
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
response rate then it probably is
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative but if a school has a
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
very low response rate then obious stay
 
05:11:26.350 --> 05:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thanks uh jman yeah if
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
I if I could follow up um how do you
 
05:11:33.990 --> 05:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
identify the school is that um an entry
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
on the survey that's
 
05:11:40.350 --> 05:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
completed yes okay thank you
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh rent Freeman did you have a question
 
05:11:44.670 --> 05:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
I did thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:11:47.948 --> 05:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I I have heard
 
05:11:50.910 --> 05:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk about how if we get um
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
below the 60% threshold that could
 
05:11:54.670 --> 05:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
affect our government it will affect our
 
05:11:56.548 --> 05:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
government grants and I've heard a lot
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
of testimony today about how if this
 
05:12:01.750 --> 05:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
optin is adopted that will absolutely
 
05:12:05.628 --> 05:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
impact it I I need to get some Imperial
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence to prove that do you
 
05:12:09.868 --> 05:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
have anything that
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
would solidify those concerns I we can
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
all we can all agree that those programs
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
are crucial they're extremely important
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on that we can also
 
05:12:24.270 --> 05:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill does not take the
 
05:12:27.390 --> 05:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
ybs out of school systems all this does
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
is allow parents to opt in so I I kind
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
of I I kind of want to don't want want
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
to put the cart before the horse as far
 
05:12:37.868 --> 05:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
as saying we're going to lose all of
 
05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
this if we put this often because
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
parents AR going to answer this I have a
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
little more faith in the parents so
 
05:12:46.350 --> 05:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
could you give me some evidence to prove
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
that in fact the numbers will go down
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for the question
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
so what we know is that we in New
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not much higher than the
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
60% threshold so because we're close to
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
that line if we have any reduction in
 
05:13:04.830 --> 05:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
data we won we will um you know not make
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
for more accurate data but simply less
 
05:13:08.590 --> 05:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
data and if we H if we don't meet the
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
60% % threshold we will be at risk for
 
05:13:15.230 --> 05:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
not understanding this these the needs
 
05:13:17.310 --> 05:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
of our youth not being able to monitor
 
05:13:20.190 --> 05:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
the outcomes over time and the funding
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
reduction or H is a potential as well so
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's the the if we were
 
05:13:30.670 --> 05:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
collecting today yrbs at a 95% threshold
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
or something it might be less concerning
 
05:13:34.910 --> 05:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think the reason that we are are so
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
concerned is that if any reduction in
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
what we collect today puts us very close
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
to that 60% threshold know if my
 
05:13:42.480 --> 05:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
to that 60% threshold know if my
colleagues

05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
TR thank you um thank you for taking the
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
question let me just ask so the 65% that
 
05:13:51.310 --> 05:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is at right now that's
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
with everyone
 
05:13:57.150 --> 05:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
opting out from it so are we saying 35%
 
05:13:57.160 --> 05:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
opting out from it so are we saying 35%
opt

05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
opt
 
05:13:59.040 --> 05:14:01.070 align:start position:0%
opt
out

05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry so I'll already schools are
 
05:14:05.548 --> 05:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to participate in
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
the survey so the the schools need to
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
opt in and then parents are given the
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out and then students
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
can also choose not to take the survey
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
or not to answer any questions so
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's multiple layers of of opting you
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
know into the survey now both by
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
District family and individual and to
 
05:14:27.150 --> 05:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
the actual percentage of those that
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
answer yeah so I can say that um let's
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
see so far 2023 it was 84% of the
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
schools participated and then of those
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
76% of the students participated which
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
creates the overall response rate of
 
05:14:53.070 --> 05:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
64% and in addition student responses
 
05:14:55.750 --> 05:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
will not be counted if they um
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
essentially CDC will do certain checks
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
to see if they're doing something like
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
just giving the same answer for
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
everything those responses will also be
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
thrown out so the you know the worst of
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
the if a student's really not taking it
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
R Woodcock I appreciate your patience R
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
Cordell um so going if I may go back to
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
your comment for represent if 35% you
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
talk about the lay opt out but you said
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
84% so of the school systems in New
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire participated so does that mean
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
then I'm just trying to make sure I'm
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
clear that the 16% of those school
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
systems that did not participate chose
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
for for their group not participate so
 
05:15:42.548 --> 05:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
the local loc local government the local
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
school boards the local parents made
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
that choice and the school board said
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay we won is that basically what we're
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
saying yes thank
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
you um Mr Rogers did you have comments
 
05:15:57.150 --> 05:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
also I have just a b everything's been
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
so well covered I don't have much to to
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
add other than to try to answer
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative J's question about the
 
05:16:05.948 --> 05:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
weight The Waiting um so to give an
 
05:16:07.150 --> 05:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
example the weight is the number of
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
states that have representative data so
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
if for example if 26 States participated
 
05:16:14.708 --> 05:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh in the ybs only and only nine meant
 
05:16:16.990 --> 05:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
the participate the participation rate
 
05:16:18.670 --> 05:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to get the weighted uh
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
results so for example in 2023 39 States
 
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
participated in the ybs and 36 States me
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
the participation rate so the percent
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
weighted is 92.3 if that makes sense say
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
that one more time okay read the last
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
yes in 2023 for example 39 States
 
05:16:40.190 --> 05:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
participated in the ybs and 36 only 36
 
05:16:42.548 --> 05:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
meant the participation rate so that
 
05:16:45.628 --> 05:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
percent is rated to come out to 92.3% on
 
05:16:48.110 --> 05:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
the website okay and the only other
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
thing I I did want to add my colleagues
 
05:16:51.548 --> 05:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
have covered everything so well is you
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
know if if a um if the ybs would be you
 
05:16:57.510 --> 05:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
know would be an opt out um the burden
 
05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
on schools to follow up with parents to
 
05:17:01.390 --> 05:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
call parents to try to get that
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
participation rate up and follow up and
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
and make sure that people are aware that
 
05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
the survey is being given um you know
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
there there would be an Administration
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
burden to try to raise it get to get
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
that participation rate up so that's
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
just something to consider thank you
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
repres Noble thank you Mr chair and
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um is
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
it possible for us to see the
 
05:17:29.670 --> 05:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
District I think we'd have to get back
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
to you on that the superintendant all
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
are given their data what we publish is
 
05:17:38.910 --> 05:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide data and by Regional public
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
Health Network okay so you would be able
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
to see it within region but not Town
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
specific thank
 
05:17:50.110 --> 05:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much just wanted to
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
be for the record we we do have we are
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to the amendment just I don't
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
think we said that thank
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.680 --> 05:18:04.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:18:04.110 --> 05:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:18:15.390 --> 05:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.840 --> 05:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
I'll

05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
set so good afternoon um chairman and
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
05:18:51.628 --> 05:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
name is Jennifer Chisum and I am the
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
coalition to end homelessness um and so
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
I decided to come up to testify as an
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
agency who very um much so is looking
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
forward to using some yrbs data um so
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
one of the flagship products I guess of
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire Coalition is our
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of homelessness uh in New
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire report um hopefully everybody
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
has gotten one in their mailbox and has
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
seen it um and so we analyze data to
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
track Trends on homelessness in the
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
state um and so in 2021 y RBS added a
 
05:19:28.030 --> 05:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
question about um housing status that
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
we're very much looking forward to to
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
using as I said um in our next report um
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
youth homelessness is tremendously
 
05:19:40.670 --> 05:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to count notor iously so um
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so we're just concerned that
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
anything that we do that's going to put
 
05:19:48.430 --> 05:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
um data at risk for us to be able to
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
tell the true Narrative of what's
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
Happening across the state with youth
 
05:19:53.548 --> 05:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness um it you know
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
scares us especially hearing that many
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
of our districts are so close to that
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
participation rate um so we I am not a
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know data expert um we contract with
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um fiscal policy Institute
 
05:20:07.350 --> 05:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
to do our data crunching um and so I do
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
know that there have been data points
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
that haven't been able to use that I've
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
love I would love to talk about um but
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
it just was found not to be
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative that there wasn't enough
 
05:20:17.548 --> 05:20:17.558 align:start position:0%
data um to be able to use it um and so
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
with the difficulties of tracking youth
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
homelessness um we already know it's a
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
huge issue in the state so um in our
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
report from this year um I can tell you
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
that from 2022 to 2023 the number of
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
people in families experiencing
 
05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness in New Hampshire uh
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
increased by 40% um and that's both in
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
the point and time data which is a one
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
24hour count on a very cold day in
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
January um as well as the um entire year
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
we also have calendar year data um and
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
then children under the age of 18
 
05:20:48.788 --> 05:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
represented one out of every five five
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
people experiencing homelessness in the
 
05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
state during that time um and so
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
because when I talk about our data I
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
talk about you know who's in the data
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
but who are we also missing and so our
 
05:21:04.030 --> 05:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
data is based on the HUD definition of
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness which is very specific and
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
very narrow um it talks to people who
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
are um in a program meant to House
 
05:21:13.548 --> 05:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
people experiencing homelessness um or
 
05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is um staying in someplace
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
not meant for human habitation so your
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
car attent um the abandoned basement um
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
and something like that what it doesn't
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
count um is all people in New Hampshire
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
who are doubled up so staying with
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
family staying with friends because they
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
have had some sort of um issue economic
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
issue maybe lost a job lost a partner um
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
you know were evicted because their
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
landlord decided to renovate uh those
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
sorts of things and are now staying in
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
someplace temporarily um and so this is
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
where we see a huge number of Youth and
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
it is such a hard number to get at so as
 
05:21:48.590 --> 05:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
I said in yrbs they added a question
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
that very specifically ask about that
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
giving the option to let us know that
 
05:21:56.110 --> 05:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
that is their situation um and so you
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
know we do have Counts from the school
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
districts that we look at um that they
 
05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
use this expanded mckin vento Act
 
05:22:04.350 --> 05:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
definition of of homelessness that
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
includes families and individuals who
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
are doubled up um students who are
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
doubled up um um but trying to count
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
this number is near impossible and so
 
05:22:14.510 --> 05:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
any kind of defin or any kind of
 
05:22:16.270 --> 05:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
information that we can get um that's
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to guide us to be able again to
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
tell The Narrative of what's truly going
 
05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
on with our children with our youth with
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
our students um is going to help us as
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
an agency publish the data which um
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
speaking to how does this data get used
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
um so this is a go-to document for not
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
only the state of New Hampshire
 
05:22:34.990 --> 05:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities for homeless service
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
providers to be able to use the data um
 
05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
and talk about the trend
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh in order to apply for Grants and
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
bring money into the state so for
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
example um the youth homelessness
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
demonstration program money from HUD um
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know these the data from this um
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to support bringing more
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
money into the state for that to support
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
our kids um and so um I think that
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's where where I'll kind of end it I
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to read my whole testimony
 
05:23:02.830 --> 05:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
other than to say that the data truly
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
drives our ability to support what we
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
need for our kids and to bring money
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
into the state um and to be able to talk
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
about it effectively um and this is data
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to lose I don't want
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
to lose it because there's no other way
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
for me to get it um and to talk about it
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
in in a in a reliable way and I will say
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
um that there is a question you know
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
people have questioned RI reliability I
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
can understand that I'm a duly licensed
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
mental health and um drug and alcohol um
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
clinician uh kind of in in my past life
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
before I got into systems work um and so
 
05:23:36.310 --> 05:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
I've worked for over a decade with
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
adolescence um with mental health
 
05:23:39.628 --> 05:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
concerns conerns who were experiencing
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
homelessness who were using substances
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
so I get where that's coming from but
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
NIH um tested the reliability of the
 
05:23:50.110 --> 05:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
yrbs the 2021 um yrbs and found that 90%
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
96% of the data in a test retest
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
situation um was at least moderately
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
moderately um reliable for retest and
 
05:23:57.600 --> 05:23:58.310 align:start position:0%
moderately um reliable for retest and
that

05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
73% um was either um substantially or
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly reliable um and so that we're
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
looking at something that NIH is saying
 
05:24:10.990 --> 05:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
like yes is good data um I don't want to
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.320 --> 05:24:19.868 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:24:19.868 --> 05:24:19.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes R I'm
 
05:24:24.750 --> 05:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I was not writing fast enough you
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
said 96% was moderately reliable and um
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
yep and
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
73% uh was found to be substantially um
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
or almost perfectly reliable thank you
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
repres Morse uh thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I I do see
 
05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from with uh the
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
necessity for the homeless information
 
05:24:43.628 --> 05:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
what I'm struggling to wrap my head
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
around would be one of the questions on
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
Firearms within the home so parents who
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
don't want let's say that made
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
information that could be somehow
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
brought back to them and I know there's
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
been controversy on the anonymous
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
aspects of it um how would let's say a
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
question revolving around Firearms with
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
a home be more beneficial data
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
collection um so you know a Firearms is
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
not not something that I can speak
 
05:25:08.830 --> 05:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to however it is is my
 
05:25:10.350 --> 05:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
understanding I'll back go back to the
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
fact that um from my understanding of
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
the survey it is anonymous so that it um
 
05:25:15.868 --> 05:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
gets us good information while
 
05:25:17.990 --> 05:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining family privacy on all of the
 
05:25:19.470 --> 05:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
issues that are are being discussed
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
within it you know so homelessness in
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
and of itself also carries a stigma um
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
you know parents often times either
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
don't know that they um qualifi and
 
05:25:27.868 --> 05:25:27.878 align:start position:0%
students themselves don't know that they
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
qualify under the definition of
 
05:25:31.708 --> 05:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
homelessness and so don't know to say
 
05:25:33.830 --> 05:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
anything to ask for help ask for um
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
Services um and you know and also
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's that stigma because sometimes
 
05:25:39.868 --> 05:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
there's a fear I don't want dcyf in my
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
home um you know so I think that from my
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
understanding the survey is designed um
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
to protect that s the survey data in
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of questions that
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
people would show concern about
 
05:25:52.270 --> 05:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
potentially um so and I understand that
 
05:25:57.628 --> 05:25:57.638 align:start position:0%
privacy concern thank you ruption of um
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question again with the
 
05:26:05.350 --> 05:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
requiring of the optin versus opt out um
 
05:26:08.590 --> 05:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
modality um is there a potential for as
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
missing key indicators around what are
 
05:26:12.430 --> 05:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
called Aces or adverse childhood
 
05:26:15.910 --> 05:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
experiences in addition to that um I
 
05:26:17.548 --> 05:26:17.558 align:start position:0%
know I and I that maybe this question is
 
05:26:18.990 --> 05:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for the Department I
 
05:26:20.830 --> 05:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
can follow up later but in the event
 
05:26:22.270 --> 05:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
that there is some sort of disaster
 
05:26:24.070 --> 05:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
where like a debart team is like
 
05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
dispatched into communities or towns and
 
05:26:28.270 --> 05:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
that could possibly impact that
 
05:26:31.708 --> 05:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
Community for years coming would this
 
05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
impact the ability to be able to help
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
those communities over a longterm
 
05:26:38.430 --> 05:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
trajectory Shar I'll put on my clinical
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
hat for a minute um is somebody who's um
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
trained in tfcbt which is trauma focused
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy and have
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work with adolescence um
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
Aces if people don't know it's the
 
05:26:51.150 --> 05:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood um events study which
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
shows that um a series of I think it's
 
05:26:55.548 --> 05:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
maybe 11 different things is just so
 
05:26:57.310 --> 05:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
impactful on people that can happen to
 
05:26:59.230 --> 05:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
them when they're kids and it affects
 
05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
not only mental health but also physical
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
health outcomes as adults um and it's
 
05:27:05.948 --> 05:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
extremely powerful data um and so I
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
would say absolutely yes you know the
 
05:27:08.590 --> 05:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
things that you were asking about in the
 
05:27:11.150 --> 05:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
ybs um all kind of play to some of the
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
the aces um that you're talking about
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
here um and so as a prevention tool to
 
05:27:17.750 --> 05:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
like again truly know The Narrative of
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on with our kids um you
 
05:27:22.270 --> 05:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
know I'll say anecdotally in in my
 
05:27:23.948 --> 05:27:23.958 align:start position:0%
substance Ed sort of work like I can
 
05:27:25.270 --> 05:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
think of a 14-year-old that was
 
05:27:28.548 --> 05:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
injecting opiates um you know that Mom
 
05:27:31.548 --> 05:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
didn't know the school didn't know um
 
05:27:33.548 --> 05:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
and so you know is this a place for her
 
05:27:35.548 --> 05:27:35.558 align:start position:0%
privately to have been able to say like
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
this is something that's going on with
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
me um and and to kind of tell that story
 
05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
like you know like let's give the kids
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
the opportunity um to be able to share
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
what's what's going on um and so I think
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
I missed the second part of your
 
05:27:51.310 --> 05:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
question but debart um so debart is a
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful debriefing tool for any a
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
place that's had you know a traumatic
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
incident um you know therapist will come
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.628 --> 05:28:03.638 align:start position:0%
just okay yeah and so I would say that
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
again just as much data as we can get um
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to know what's going on in
 
05:28:09.150 --> 05:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
those communities and what the needs are
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
because if you have the the the best
 
05:28:12.868 --> 05:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
data that you can looking at a community
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
um to to know what their needs are
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
bringing in the debart team or whatever
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
it might be for for those communities so
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Woodcock
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%

speak in support of the amendment to HP
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
446 which seeks to require parental
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%

income however despite these protections
 
05:29:38.990 --> 05:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
the CDC risk behav Behavior survey still
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
asks all these questions that could
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
violate these very principles the courts
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
have ruled that such surveys are legal
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
as long as they are voluntary but we
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
must ask ourselves is a survey really
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
voluntary if the parent who has the
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
ultimate authority over the child's
 
05:29:55.270 --> 05:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
well-being has not given consent
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
moreover there's an argument that this
 
05:29:58.990 --> 05:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
lack of affirmative parental consent
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
could be a violation of New Hampshire
 
05:30:03.310 --> 05:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution specifically article 2B
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
which guarantees the right to privacy
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
and protection from government intrusion
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
parents Safeguard their children's
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
rights including the right to privacy
 
05:30:11.670 --> 05:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
until they reach adulthood and it should
 
05:30:12.910 --> 05:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
be their decisions and not the
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
government's whether personal
 
05:30:16.510 --> 05:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
information is shared I understand that
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
there are concerns about Federal funding
 
05:30:19.628 --> 05:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
and the potential impacts of this
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
amendment however we must not Overlook
 
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that the state could be
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
treading on thin legal ground by
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
allowing surveys that may not be as
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary as they
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
appear at what point do we draw the line
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
between voluntary participation and
 
05:30:33.990 --> 05:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
government overreach into the lives of
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
our children the amendment to HB 446
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
simply ensures that parents par have the
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
ability to make an informed decision
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
regarding their children's participation
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the survey I urge you to support this
 
05:30:50.910 --> 05:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Morris thank
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
question so I only have one so far and
 
05:31:00.150 --> 05:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
um if one or more of these questions
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
trigger something in students is there
 
05:31:04.190 --> 05:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
anyone equipped to handle the situation
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
on site uh thank you for the question
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
that is not my area of expertise I I
 
05:31:10.990 --> 05:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't affirmatively know the answer to
 
05:31:11.000 --> 05:31:12.110 align:start position:0%
don't affirmatively know the answer to
that

05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
05:31:18.030 --> 05:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
TR thank you thank you foring taking my
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
question if if these are
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
anonymous questions does this still
 
05:31:26.110 --> 05:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
apply does that principle or that
 
05:31:28.270 --> 05:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
protection still apply thank you for the
 
05:31:30.910 --> 05:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
question yes it does um because the
 
05:31:35.708 --> 05:31:35.718 align:start position:0%
child is still sharing those things
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
yes R Cornell thank you Mr chair I
 
05:31:40.750 --> 05:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
didn't catch at the beginning when you
 
05:31:42.470 --> 05:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
listed the things what what were you
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
listing the protection of pupil's Rights
 
05:31:46.628 --> 05:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
Act of
 
05:31:49.548 --> 05:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
1978 and that is still in effect that's
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's no that's a federal
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
law so followup yes in the 32 years that
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
this um survey has been given has there
 
05:32:03.390 --> 05:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
been any complaints or any follow up or
 
05:32:06.830 --> 05:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
any laws that have been broken by this I
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
certainly know plenty appearance who
 
05:32:09.868 --> 05:32:09.878 align:start position:0%
complained yes I don't know any who have
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
pursued legal action but also understand
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
it takes a certain type of person to go
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
through and get a lawyer and start suing
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
the state I mean those kind of people
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily come around all the
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
time um but it doesn't mean that the
 
05:32:27.868 --> 05:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
there rer Freeman quick question very
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
quick thank you very much thank you for
 
05:32:35.628 --> 05:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what you're saying
 
05:32:37.948 --> 05:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
is that this protection of pupil rights
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
from 1978 applies only if filling out
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
the questionnaire isn't voluntary is
 
05:32:45.120 --> 05:32:46.708 align:start position:0%
the questionnaire isn't voluntary is
that

05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:50.030 --> 05:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct understanding that opt out is
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
technically not voluntary but opt in is
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
that is my opinion thank
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for being
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.948 --> 05:33:05.958 align:start position:0%

I just want wanted to start by answering
 
05:34:11.868 --> 05:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
um a question from representative Morse
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
about um in regards to the question on
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
the survey around guns um and so that
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
data is or can be directly related to
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
Legal means reduction in injury
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
prevention and suicide prevention and
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
could in the way that we use the data in
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
schools and in the community inform the
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
need for some messaging around gun
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
safety safe storage other you know
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
preventative measures from an injury
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
prevention suici prevention um type lens
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to share that and hope
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
that that is some of what you were
 
05:34:45.788 --> 05:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
looking for in asking that
 
05:34:49.230 --> 05:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
question um so as one of the state's 13
 
05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
Regional public health networks I work
 
05:34:53.110 --> 05:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
with schools and other partners from
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
across our communities to work to
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
improve the health wellness and quality
 
05:34:58.990 --> 05:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
of life for everybody in our communities
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that um usually first and foremost
 
05:35:06.670 --> 05:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
includes our youth um and so we use the
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
ybs data as the public health network
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
our schools use the ybs data our
 
05:35:13.390 --> 05:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
community organizations Healthcare
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
entities Etc use this data to identify
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
as a as a vital tool in our strategic
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
planning process so we use this data to
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
inform you know what are our kids seeing
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
what are the students and youth in our
 
05:35:28.510 --> 05:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
communities facing what challenges are
 
05:35:31.030 --> 05:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
there what are the underlying
 
05:35:34.590 --> 05:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
issues having the opt out process allows
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
us this reliable representative data and
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
that represent reprentative data is
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
collected through an evidence-based
 
05:35:44.670 --> 05:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey it's a
 
05:35:46.590 --> 05:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized evidence-based
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
tool that gives us the most accurate and
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
informative data that we use to do our
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
work we
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
develop policies programs practices um
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
it has been used by schools in our
 
05:36:04.670 --> 05:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
region um that shared with me they were
 
05:36:06.910 --> 05:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
able to use the data around mental
 
05:36:09.270 --> 05:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
health and substance use to justify
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
adding um a licensed alcohol and drug
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
counselor onto their staff um and that
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
has positively improved the health and
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
well-being mental health substance use
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
data that was there was
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
followed um in speaking to the optin
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
versus opt out process um I
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
also oppose the amendment to um create
 
05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
an opt-in process because not only would
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
it create an un unnecessary
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that would not
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
take 10 minutes of time between our
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
schools and those who support the
 
05:36:48.030 --> 05:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
schools and administering the ybs um the
 
05:36:52.590 --> 05:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
opt out process is widely supported on
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
the handout that I shared um
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
participation in active active consent
 
05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
can very likely create a biased sample
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
meaning that those who are at highest
 
05:37:08.430 --> 05:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
risk for some of risky some of the risk
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
behaviors or some of the issues
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
highlighted in the ybs are likely to be
 
05:37:16.430 --> 05:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
those who do not receive active opin
 
05:37:18.430 --> 05:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
consent to participate in this survey
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
and so our data would be skewed and
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
unreliable and it would hinder our
 
05:37:26.310 --> 05:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
ability to accurately and or to
 
05:37:28.430 --> 05:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
accurately support the students in our
 
05:37:28.440 --> 05:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
accurately support the students in our
our

05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I'm happy to take questions
 
05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%

to Y New Hampshire it is a new program
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
um that was executed by the governor and
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
Council um in the past in December of
 
05:38:16.510 --> 05:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
last year um we did have a kickoff in
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
January um we have currently been
 
05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
working with uh New Hampshire high
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
schools and working with youth in
 
05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
particular um looking at their yrbs data
 
05:38:33.708 --> 05:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
um and teaching them how to actually
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
look at this data and find Solutions s
 
05:38:41.150 --> 05:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
to bring to their peers so they are
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
actively involved in the ybs so what we
 
05:38:46.590 --> 05:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
are doing with the the getting to Y
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
which is an up forlearning program which
 
05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
is across the Vermont whole state of
 
05:38:55.030 --> 05:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont um we are spreading this
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
program uh Statewide in New Hampshire we

05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
to why New Hampshire so we have students
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
look looking at this ybs data and they
 
05:39:13.350 --> 05:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
are finding solutions for their peers I
 
05:39:16.350 --> 05:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
do have my card if you would like to uh
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%

with more information I will email you
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
all the information on getting to Y as
 
05:39:26.670 --> 05:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
well as our March newsletter um with uh
 
05:39:28.350 --> 05:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
quotes from students around New
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and parents are even uh loving
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to empower their
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
children to look at this data and become
 
05:39:40.590 --> 05:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
change agents in the in New Hampshire I
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
would like to um finish my testimony
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
with a quote from Lucas Legacy he is a
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Regional High School student he
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
was trained this past last month um at
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
in Plymouth uh at the Common Man Inn um
 
05:40:01.070 --> 05:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
along with three other schools and he he
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
quotes what's different in my experience
 
05:40:05.788 --> 05:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
with getting to why compared to other
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
clubs that I am in is that getting to Y
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
is purposeful many people do different
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
things for various reasons but the only
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
one I have found to be both engaging and
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
long lasting is something that has
 
05:40:20.830 --> 05:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
purpose getting to why emulates that
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly so I would like to open it up
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
for any questions I actually just came
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
from a training in Milford where we had
 
05:40:33.310 --> 05:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
three schools Keen High School s heagan
 
05:40:37.548 --> 05:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
high school as well as um Milford high
 
05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
school so it's been pretty pretty
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
exciting thank you very much you're
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions yes repres try
 
05:40:45.548 --> 05:40:45.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:40:48.510 --> 05:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
question yes explain getting to why yes
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting to why is a program which brings
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
adults and youth together looking at
 
05:40:59.628 --> 05:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
their ybs data the y stands for youth
 
05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing this they're doing the
 
05:41:04.190 --> 05:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
work they're looking at this data and it
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
youth do not get to see their YB ster
 
05:41:10.708 --> 05:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
they take this this survey but they are
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
not able to actually view the results so
 
05:41:19.548 --> 05:41:19.558 align:start position:0%
this program brings them into the
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
decision-making they're looking at the
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
data they're looking at what their peers
 
05:41:25.948 --> 05:41:25.958 align:start position:0%
are talking about they're they're
 
05:41:29.190 --> 05:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
telling us the why why is this happening
 
05:41:31.948 --> 05:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
so that's what the why stands for the
 
05:41:36.110 --> 05:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
Youth as well as why are all of these
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
these outcomes actually happening in the
 
05:41:42.910 --> 05:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
ybs so it's it's a very exciting program
 
05:41:42.920 --> 05:41:44.070 align:start position:0%
ybs so it's it's a very exciting program
you're

05:41:44.070 --> 05:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're

welcome Julie Kim oh you have a question
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes so your program was

approved by the governor in Council um
 
05:41:56.830 --> 05:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
and I suppose given money to proceed
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
knowing it was based on the data that
 
05:42:03.548 --> 05:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
you got from the youth risk survey okay
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
so they understood you were using the
 
05:42:08.548 --> 05:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
data from the
 
05:42:08.558 --> 05:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
data from the
what

05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%

05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
Kim thank you for having me today uh
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
committee and chair I am Dr Julie Kim
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a pediatric oncologist here in New
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 20 years I've raised
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
my children in New Hampshire
 
05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
but more importantly at for today I am
 
05:42:41.390 --> 05:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
the President of the New Hampshire
 
05:42:42.788 --> 05:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
chapter of the American Academy of
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and I represent over 20 over
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
200 pediatricians in our state our
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
pediatricians here want you to oppose
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 4 446 we need to keep this
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
survey as an opt out survey so we can
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
get the best data possible the yrbs is
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
as you heard is a national survey
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
conducted by the Centers for Disease
 
05:43:03.990 --> 05:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention prevention is a
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
big word here we are trying to prevent
 
05:43:08.628 --> 05:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
things from happening that could go bad
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
it is completely Anonymous there's
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually no interactive followup with
 
05:43:13.750 --> 05:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
any specific individual but the
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
information could be used to help a
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
group of like a school for example for
 
05:43:18.868 --> 05:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
pediatricians this information is
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
important because it helps um guide what
 
05:43:23.708 --> 05:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk to our patients
 
05:43:26.350 --> 05:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
about uh it could be about their mental
 
05:43:28.510 --> 05:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
health we may see it might be a new drug
 
05:43:30.230 --> 05:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's coming out an illicit drug that
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know about now but the the
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
teens are knowing about it we can't
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
actually identify the answers to a
 
05:43:36.718 --> 05:43:38.110 align:start position:0%
actually identify the answers to a
specific

05:43:38.110 --> 05:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
child so that that data is uh is
 
05:43:44.190 --> 05:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
anonymous and the survey is voluntary so
 
05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents can actually review the actual
 
05:43:48.030 --> 05:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
survey questions online and they know
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
about 10 days in advance about that this
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
survey is going to be given so they do
 
05:43:53.708 --> 05:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to opt out if they
 
05:43:55.948 --> 05:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
don't want their child to participate as
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard it's a scientifically
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
validated survey and we know from
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
science that asking a question about
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
risky Behavior does not cause someone to
 
05:44:05.468 --> 05:44:05.478 align:start position:0%
engage in that behavior instead it could
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
be a communication tool hopefully we
 
05:44:09.230 --> 05:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
have uh we all want to have open
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
communication with our children this
 
05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
survey could be a discussion point
 
05:44:15.788 --> 05:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
between the child and family about what
 
05:44:18.190 --> 05:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
was in the survey this survey learns us
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
helps us to learn more about health
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
rated behaviors and it that contribute
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
to leading causes of death we don't
 
05:44:26.350 --> 05:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
learn just about risky Behavior but we
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
as pediatricians and as the community
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
learn about obesity phys physical
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
activity diet and Asthma even it gives
 
05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
us a chance to implement programs and to
 
05:44:38.110 --> 05:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
improve health health and
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
safety as I mentioned we all want to
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
have open communication with our teens
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
but some teens who are struggling may
 
05:44:47.190 --> 05:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
not have a listening ear for them but
 
05:44:49.708 --> 05:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
this survey could be somewhat of a proxy
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
for them we need to know what is
 
05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
happening this information is important
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
to in getting the most accurate
 
05:44:57.548 --> 05:44:57.558 align:start position:0%
information so we can help these
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
children so I ask you to oppose HB 446
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
which proposes this change to an opt-in
 
05:45:05.708 --> 05:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
Pro process this will create more
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
administrative work will create delays
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
it will result in much fewer teens
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
completing the survey and the teens that
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
need the most help may actually be at
 
05:45:14.910 --> 05:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
the most risk of not being able to
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
participate this current process with
 
05:45:19.390 --> 05:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
the opt out is working and doesn't not
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
need to be changed the survey does not
 
05:45:23.230 --> 05:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
lead to risky behaviors and it's not
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
about parenting or parental rights
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
parents as I said have the option to opt
 
05:45:29.948 --> 05:45:29.958 align:start position:0%
their child out this survey is about
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
getting the most accurate information
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
and gives us a chance to intervene when
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.510 --> 05:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent Morris
 
05:45:41.628 --> 05:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:45:43.150 --> 05:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned a little while
 
05:45:45.468 --> 05:45:45.478 align:start position:0%
ago about identifying a new drug but how
 
05:45:46.990 --> 05:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
would you be able to do that if there's
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
no question on the survey to kind of add
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
or tweet the survey may be about
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
substance use um but it allows us to
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
know that there's something going on we
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
can look at Trends and see if there's
 
05:45:58.390 --> 05:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
something different and we may have to
 
05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
investigate further about what that
 
05:45:59.798 --> 05:46:02.230 align:start position:0%
investigate further about what that
difference

05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
is thank you very much for being here

cordelli and members of the committee uh
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm working off my phone I've been here
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
so long today my computer is dead um
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony today
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate the opportunity for the
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
record I'm Becky Wilson representing the
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
I was not going to testify on this bill
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
I know some of you have heard uh NH
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
hba's testimony on versions of this bill
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
over the past several sessions however I
 
05:46:44.110 --> 05:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify um and offer a
 
05:46:45.788 --> 05:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
few thoughts based on some of the
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
previous testimony and some of the
 
05:46:48.510 --> 05:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns that have come
 
05:46:51.310 --> 05:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee um to
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh each year Our member School
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
boards vote on resolutions um and
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
statements of belief uh to help Drive
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
their advocacy positions for the Year
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
this past fall um our nsba members again
 
05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
affirmed two specific um um resolutions
 
05:47:11.708 --> 05:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
regarding consent um nsba supports
 
05:47:13.628 --> 05:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
language in legislation that provides
 
05:47:15.628 --> 05:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
parents the right to opt out of content
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and programs they feel are not
 
05:47:19.030 --> 05:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their children however
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
nhba opposes language requiring parents
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
to opt into content and programs for
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
their children of which we would
 
05:47:27.788 --> 05:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
consider the yrbs specifically to that
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
um the opt-in language creates an undue
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
burden on the school district to account
 
05:47:33.628 --> 05:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
for every student who would participate
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
versus the few who choose not to
 
05:47:37.468 --> 05:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
participate uh that resolution has been
 
05:47:41.708 --> 05:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
in place since 2017 so it is not new um
 
05:47:43.390 --> 05:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
there was a new resolution as well this
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
year that came from Member school boards
 
05:47:47.430 --> 05:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
asking the nsba to support legislation
 
05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
that would require the state to fund the
 
05:47:52.590 --> 05:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
cost of the yrbs for the middle schools
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the state that want to uh provide
 
05:47:56.708 --> 05:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
that to the middle schools so there's a
 
05:47:59.070 --> 05:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
lot of value that is given to the yrbs
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
by school districts and to local
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
communities um the state does fund the
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
high school version of that um the
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
middle school version if a District
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
chooses to take to offer that they have
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
to take the cost for that so there was a
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
genuine effort to try to secure more
 
05:48:16.350 --> 05:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
funding for that given the value that it
 
05:48:18.990 --> 05:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
provides school districts I just want to
 
05:48:21.030 --> 05:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate again that the local school
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
board does have to take a vote to accept
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the yrbs and to offer it to their
 
05:48:27.670 --> 05:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
school district that is done at a
 
05:48:29.548 --> 05:48:29.558 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed meeting that parents
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
and community members would be obviously
 
05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh well aware is happening it would be
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
on the agenda um that would be a great
 
05:48:37.990 --> 05:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
place for people to ask questions to the
 
05:48:40.030 --> 05:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
local school board if they had questions
 
05:48:43.070 --> 05:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
about what people are using it for um
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
many districts do take the results once
 
05:48:46.590 --> 05:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
they're available and offer a
 
05:48:48.430 --> 05:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
presentation at a local Schoolboard
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
meeting that is publicly noticed as well
 
05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the re and review the results
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
that I think you've heard previous
 
05:48:56.510 --> 05:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
speakers talk about that are available
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
at the district level um that's to
 
05:49:01.230 --> 05:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
assist schools and communities um to try
 
05:49:02.910 --> 05:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're tailoring their
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
programs and their resources to actual
 
05:49:08.110 --> 05:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
needs of students as opposed to what um
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
adults in the room are guessing are the
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
students needs sometimes we are not
 
05:49:12.910 --> 05:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know if any of you have
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
ever had middle or high school students
 
05:49:16.990 --> 05:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes what we think um they're
 
05:49:18.910 --> 05:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about or are happening are not
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily what is actually happening
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
um and just to also you know clarify
 
05:49:27.150 --> 05:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
that while this this is an informational
 
05:49:30.510 --> 05:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
survey and is anonymous again um
 
05:49:31.990 --> 05:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think I've heard it many
 
05:49:33.910 --> 05:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
times by sponsors of this bill that it's
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
taken as a joke um middle and high
 
05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
school students often make jokes about
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
things because it is a lot easier to
 
05:49:41.150 --> 05:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
make a joke than it is to talk about
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
difficult things with your peers or your
 
05:49:46.150 --> 05:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
family um this is an opportunity to try
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
to get real information from students
 
05:49:51.070 --> 05:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
that can be used for those purposes um
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
lastly I would just say the ability to
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
communicate the survey results year
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
after year at locally uh local
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings that are public is
 
05:49:59.520 --> 05:50:00.310 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings that are public is
a

05:50:00.310 --> 05:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
transparency Pro it gives the community
 
05:50:04.990 --> 05:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at resources that
 
05:50:06.990 --> 05:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
have been secured as a result of some of
 
05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
the yrbs data and make sure the
 
05:50:10.990 --> 05:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
resources are actually working and that
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars are going to programs
 
05:50:14.430 --> 05:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
for communities and families that
 
05:50:17.310 --> 05:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
actually have a positive impact um
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
lastly I will just say quickly
 
05:50:21.548 --> 05:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
representative that some of this
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislature specifically has put into
 
05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
place a number of other resources for
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
students that do not provide uh direct
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
contact to parents that deal with
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
students who are struggling putting the
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
ID C uh number for on the back of ID
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
cards for the suicide prevention hotline
 
05:50:40.110 --> 05:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
for the Eating Disorders hotline for one
 
05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
trusted adult some of those things don't
 
05:50:45.390 --> 05:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a other end where
 
05:50:46.990 --> 05:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
people are calling parents immediately
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
after they get off the phone with
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
students the yrbs is no different I know
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
that this committee cares a great deal
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
about students well-being and I think
 
05:50:56.030 --> 05:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is just one other manner of getting
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
to that I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
much will uh end the hearing on uh House
 
05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 446 and uh start up the hearing on
 
05:51:14.110 --> 05:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
431 Amendment
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%

05:51:23.150 --> 05:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
out for the clerk and in the meantime we
 
05:51:25.390 --> 05:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
pass around
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:52:21.310 --> 05:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.320 --> 05:52:44.590 align:start position:0%
 
52

05:52:44.590 --> 05:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.990 --> 05:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
ready we'll open the hearing on HB 431

05:53:11.948 --> 05:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:53:14.468 --> 05:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
um Let me let me just say that we just
 
05:53:17.310 --> 05:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
heard about the importance of data and
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
making decisions that's what this
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is about um we have heard from
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
our constituents we've heard here in the
 
05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh legislative office building about
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
special education costs and what is
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
driving uh increased costs for special
 
05:53:35.958 --> 05:53:36.990 align:start position:0%
driving uh increased costs for special
education

05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
increased numbers of students who have
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
been identified as special education um
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
that is some of what the proposed
 
05:53:48.830 --> 05:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
Commission in this amendment is going to
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
try to get at uh on the first page
 
05:53:54.430 --> 05:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see the establishment of the
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
commi commission and the membership uh
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
but most importantly I wanted to get it
 
05:54:03.590 --> 05:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
down to Roman 3 and what the uh
 
05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
commission is uh supposed to be looking
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
at um uh it starts with uh referral
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
rates I just mentioned um we've had um a
 
05:54:21.788 --> 05:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
fairly constant number of students being
 
05:54:24.350 --> 05:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
identified as special education but at
 
05:54:27.548 --> 05:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
the same time enrollment has decreased
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh considerably so the percentage of
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
students being identified has gone up
 
05:54:36.430 --> 05:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
considerably um why is that why are uh
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
students being labeled as other health
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
impaired what are the parameters of that
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
um we have uh Federal Ida categories 13
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
categories and some national uh
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
percentages um for each of those
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
categories some which
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
correspond uh somewhat to uh information
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
from here in New Hampshire some that do
 
05:55:01.230 --> 05:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
not and we need to look at
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
that uh has there been any increase in
 
05:55:07.150 --> 05:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
referrals since the start of the covid
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic um there is antidotal
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
um uh then we also want to definitely
 
05:55:26.030 --> 05:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
look at the cost data um and some of
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
that is on page two um you know there
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
are services that are provided that are
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
what are those
 
05:55:44.190 --> 05:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
costs um and uh how is that
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
increasing um is that part of IEP goals
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh and services uh for 504 plans we need
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
to look at that um we need to look at
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
the uh comp
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
comparison of what is required by
 
05:56:06.590 --> 05:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
Ida what is required in state law but
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
then what is required in
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
rules there's a lot more in rules than
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
in either federal or state law we need
 
05:56:18.670 --> 05:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
to look at that there was um an analysis
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
done in
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
2016 almost 10 years ago we need to look
 
05:56:28.788 --> 05:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
at that and is uh are our rules out of
 
05:56:32.310 --> 05:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
line with state and federal law and is
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
that part of the driving uh for
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
increased cost for special educ
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
education and increased identification
 
05:56:39.798 --> 05:56:41.150 align:start position:0%
education and increased identification
of

05:56:41.150 --> 05:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:56:41.160 --> 05:56:43.230 align:start position:0%
of
children

05:56:43.230 --> 05:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:56:47.830 --> 05:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
um local districts uh reporting of cost
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
to uh to the Department of Education
 
05:56:53.548 --> 05:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
there is some data being reported from
 
05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
the districts and you've all all heard
 
05:56:57.788 --> 05:56:57.798 align:start position:0%
mention of the doe
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
25 um form that is used to provide data
 
05:57:04.830 --> 05:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the um local districts uh we need
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
to look at that data and look at
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
possible expansion of the data that's
 
05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
being reported from local districts to
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
the department on those
 
05:57:20.788 --> 05:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
costs um we also know from the um last
 
05:57:23.948 --> 05:57:23.958 align:start position:0%
audit that was done that local districts
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
can come up with their own plans for due
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
process hearings their own programs that
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't even know
 
05:57:36.868 --> 05:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
about we need to look at that and
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
determine um if those programs are being
 
05:57:45.070 --> 05:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
useful perhaps they should be Statewide
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
if they
 
05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
are uh Medicaid to schools is a large
 
05:57:55.390 --> 05:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
program um the last number I saw was um
 
05:57:58.030 --> 05:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
something uh above $10
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
million um to school districts in
 
05:58:02.430 --> 05:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
Billing for Medicaid
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
services um we need to look at that um
 
05:58:05.878 --> 05:58:06.670 align:start position:0%
services um we need to look at that um
the

05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh who uses those funds
 
05:58:12.750 --> 05:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
when reimbursements are made for
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
services where do those funds go do they
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
go back into special education do they
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
go back to the district do they go back
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the town we need to get a handle on
 
05:58:28.830 --> 05:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
that um I've heard anotated that some
 
05:58:31.510 --> 05:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
districts use outside billing
 
05:58:35.310 --> 05:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
services for this some do it inhouse we
 
05:58:37.830 --> 05:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
need to look at that I've heard of a
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
district that uses a billing service in
 
05:58:44.548 --> 05:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
Texas actually um so is the billing
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
being done
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
efficiently and what are the categories
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
and reimbursement rates for these
 
05:58:52.080 --> 05:58:54.510 align:start position:0%
and reimbursement rates for these
Services

05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
Services
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
um we've always heard about the um use
 
05:59:02.070 --> 05:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
of legal services in special education
 
05:59:05.468 --> 05:59:05.478 align:start position:0%
for IEPs for due process hearings uh but
 
05:59:06.628 --> 05:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
that those
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
legal costs are covered by Insurance
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
paid by the districts I'd like to get a
 
05:59:14.190 --> 05:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
handle on that what are the insurance
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
costs that are uh being paid by
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts um in terms of the students um
 
05:59:24.430 --> 05:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
what are the graduation rates by the
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
type of U uh
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
diploma um that they are getting um
 
05:59:35.788 --> 05:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
let's have a breakdown of that um so I
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
think those are some of the the main
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
things that um we would like this
 
05:59:44.750 --> 05:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
commission to look at but certainly um
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
the number of students being identified
 
05:59:51.948 --> 05:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
and the costs um as we've talked about
 
05:59:55.350 --> 05:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh we know that this catastrophic Aid
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
that's now called special education aid
 
06:00:02.350 --> 06:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
for um The High um cost uh Services
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
provided to some students but the real
 
06:00:05.638 --> 06:00:06.670 align:start position:0%
provided to some students but the real
dollar

06:00:06.670 --> 06:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
that is being paid by districts and by
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
the state are not for those students but
 
06:00:13.788 --> 06:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
for all the other students this
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
something um the number 800 sticks in my
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
mind of of those students compared to
 
06:00:24.628 --> 06:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
the other uh 30 plus thousand um that
 
06:00:29.310 --> 06:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
are uh um in one of the other 13 uh
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
categories as defined by
 
06:00:34.708 --> 06:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
Ida um and so those are some of the
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
costs we need to look at
 
06:00:39.468 --> 06:00:39.478 align:start position:0%
also uh so that is the purpose of this
 
06:00:42.910 --> 06:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
commission and I think um we need to get
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
the uh a handle on this and look at the
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
costs because um we've heard about the
 
06:00:51.708 --> 06:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
complaints from local districts about
 
06:00:54.390 --> 06:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of special education and we
 
06:00:57.310 --> 06:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
need to um get a handle on it so we can
 
06:01:00.510 --> 06:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
try and do something about it and help
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
um both parents and school districts and
 
06:01:05.468 --> 06:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of the costs thank
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any questions
 
06:01:11.310 --> 06:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you madam
 
06:01:12.350 --> 06:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:01:13.868 --> 06:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
question so when you say we need to get
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
a handle on the cost are you also saying
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
we need to get a handle on how many kids
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
are identified I mean it sounds like
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
from your presentation that we have too
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
many kids being identified and when I
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at U that was my question but
 
06:01:30.910 --> 06:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
number 20 uh line 29 whether there are
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
interventions I mean that struck me I
 
06:01:34.510 --> 06:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
thought in my experience in the
 
06:01:36.910 --> 06:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
classroom we could not re refer unless
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
we tried a number of interventions
 
06:01:40.830 --> 06:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
before we could even go through the
 
06:01:44.830 --> 06:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
referral process so I guess that right
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
but my question is um on the number of
 
06:01:49.310 --> 06:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
kids are identif right yes I want to
 
06:01:51.150 --> 06:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at the number I think we
 
06:01:52.350 --> 06:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at the number of
 
06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
kids because the percentages have gone
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you representative Murray uh
 
06:02:03.030 --> 06:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um with regard to
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
um I think you mentioned Insurance costs
 
06:02:08.788 --> 06:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
paid by districts um I think
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're I want to make sure we're not
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
running up against any thing that could
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
be construed is related to Hippa or any
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
of those types of things so how are you
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
ensuring that when this information is
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
being looked at it is being looked at in
 
06:02:26.750 --> 06:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
a way that comports with all of those
 
06:02:32.910 --> 06:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines um uh uh I'm not sure about H
 
06:02:34.990 --> 06:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
but I'd have to go back I I'm not sure
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
if uh uh well I'll leave it at that I I
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
want to look at that some more um but uh
 
06:02:45.190 --> 06:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see Insurance costs um not
 
06:02:48.670 --> 06:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily um at the individual level
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
but at the school
 
06:02:54.190 --> 06:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
level and follow up if I follow up thank
 
06:02:58.590 --> 06:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
you um Madam chair and um with regard to
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
um I think you had said just um about
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
rules and rul making Authority it is
 
06:03:07.150 --> 06:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
generally the legislature that empowers
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority or suggest that it
 
06:03:12.030 --> 06:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
goes to that step
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
so if we are silent in the legislative
 
06:03:17.230 --> 06:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
process on things that ultimately go to
 
06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.270 --> 06:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I guess what I'm asking
 
06:03:27.750 --> 06:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
is where what would the fact finding be
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
I guess because the silence in the
 
06:03:32.788 --> 06:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
legislature then says okay rule making
 
06:03:35.548 --> 06:03:35.558 align:start position:0%
kicks it I I don't think that that is
 
06:03:37.708 --> 06:03:37.718 align:start position:0%
the case rules are supposed to have a
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
legislative uh Source related to them so
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
I I um I think it's a problem um when
 
06:03:48.190 --> 06:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
rules are prolongated um without um a
 
06:03:48.200 --> 06:03:49.548 align:start position:0%
rules are prolongated um without um a
legislative

06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
06:03:49.558 --> 06:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
legislative
Source

06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
Source
 
06:03:53.948 --> 06:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
followup what I'm talking about is when
 
06:03:56.548 --> 06:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
the statute is written though it says
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority shall be granted
 
06:04:00.670 --> 06:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
right right and so I guess that's what
 
06:04:03.390 --> 06:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm looking I'm looking at um
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
things and rules that um
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
have no pain in legislative there is no
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh statement as under a section um that
 
06:04:17.070 --> 06:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
says and rules shall be um approved by
 
06:04:20.110 --> 06:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
the state board for X
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I I so I think that
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I think there is clearly uh I I
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
remember um I used to be on heak home
 
06:04:34.190 --> 06:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
education advisory Council and we did um
 
06:04:36.670 --> 06:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
an exhaustive view because there was
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
many things in
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
rules that were not covered in State
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
Statute related to requirements uh for
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents so we had to go back
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
and filter and revise the rules to come
 
06:04:54.590 --> 06:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
in line with f in with state law and I
 
06:04:58.468 --> 06:04:58.478 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at uh special ed
 
06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
rules and see what rules are in place
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
that um go beyond what's in state or
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
federal law and if there if it's a good
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
practice that's in rules it should be
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
also in uh in state
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
bbon thank you madam chair and thank you
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question is
 
06:05:24.990 --> 06:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh again go back to the audit that's
 
06:05:26.910 --> 06:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
currently being done by the in the
 
06:05:29.070 --> 06:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
department of special education I would
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of these um items that
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
you have in here are are going to be
 
06:05:37.548 --> 06:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
addressed in the AUD it so my question
 
06:05:41.708 --> 06:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
is why um are you putting forward this
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation now instead of
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
doing it through a regular
 
06:05:50.670 --> 06:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
process um I think it is that imperative
 
06:05:54.030 --> 06:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what the LBA will um
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
find related to this in their audit um
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
but they are dealing specifically with
 
06:06:01.628 --> 06:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
the Department they're not touching
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
followup um yeah the followup would be I
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me to be premature to
 
06:06:13.708 --> 06:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
again to do anything without
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
understanding what is what issues might
 
06:06:18.270 --> 06:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
be within the department with you know
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
you start there first and if you then
 
06:06:21.788 --> 06:06:21.798 align:start position:0%
there there then you might look at
 
06:06:25.110 --> 06:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the local issues would be so I
 
06:06:28.590 --> 06:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
I would just wonder again um the the
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
need to put this spill forward right now
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
and I question
 
06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
that I think I answered that question
 
06:06:39.430 --> 06:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
representa Murray yes thank you in all
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
sincerity I I I have another question
 
06:06:44.830 --> 06:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to the timeline here of how
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
long this commission is established for
 
06:06:50.590 --> 06:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
um this is a lot of data digging a lot
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
of conversation that might include the
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal government getting data back
 
06:06:55.310 --> 06:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
from them regarding idea and certain
 
06:06:57.430 --> 06:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
other things your first initial report
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
is requested back November 1 of 2025 and
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious to know whether or not
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
there would be any
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
substantive data that could be that's
 
06:07:09.590 --> 06:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
seven months I I would hope so um and I
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
put that date in so that if there was um
 
06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
information that came to the commission
 
06:07:20.430 --> 06:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
um that could be put into legislation
 
06:07:20.440 --> 06:07:22.150 align:start position:0%
um that could be put into legislation
for

06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:07:24.510 --> 06:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
20126 um I think would be important to
 
06:07:27.750 --> 06:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
have an interim report at that point for
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
any um legislation for next year rather
 
06:07:33.868 --> 06:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
year any other questions
 
06:07:40.990 --> 06:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
06:07:43.948 --> 06:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
representative um could you if this was
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
imperative and you know what not why was
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
it not introduced as legislation by its
 
06:07:53.788 --> 06:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
own as opposed to being tagged onto as a
 
06:07:53.798 --> 06:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
own as opposed to being tagged onto as a
non-gain

06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
non-gain
 
06:07:55.120 --> 06:07:56.868 align:start position:0%
non-gain
Amendment

06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:08:01.030 --> 06:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I I had a lot of uh ideas for
 
06:08:03.670 --> 06:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation floating in my head um back
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
in September and November
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh some made it out of my head onto
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
paper some
 
06:08:14.110 --> 06:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.990 --> 06:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
kind second one follow okay um you did
 
06:08:22.030 --> 06:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
also mention uh the local level and as I
 
06:08:26.548 --> 06:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
look at lines 19 to 24 it doesn't look
 
06:08:29.310 --> 06:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
like local is really there is
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
it of the people serving on
 
06:08:47.468 --> 06:08:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay but those okay hold
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee um excuse me represent B Bon
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
06:09:02.868 --> 06:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
question um just follow up on on
 
06:09:05.190 --> 06:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's question it just
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh if um this is to address issues in
 
06:09:11.430 --> 06:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
local districts um it appears if I'm
 
06:09:13.788 --> 06:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly on the members
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the committee there's nobody
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually representing the local uh
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
school districts that could provide a
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
perspective uh the commission can invite
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
anyone they choose into uh into testify
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and uh discuss uh questions with
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
them followup follow
 
06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
um but the difference would be um if you
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide people in to give input but
 
06:09:42.670 --> 06:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
you're not giving them a seat at the
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
table to when you're talking about
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations being given so I would
 
06:09:51.590 --> 06:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm wondering would you consider
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
having representatives from local
 
06:09:55.190 --> 06:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
districts special education
 
06:09:57.030 --> 06:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
administrators people that are involved
 
06:10:00.030 --> 06:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
in the field be part of this uh
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
commission uh I I think um here at the
 
06:10:05.948 --> 06:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
committee we've get lots of of
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:12.708 --> 06:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
testifying one more question
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative Murry thanks uh
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Noble um my other question
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
was whether or not this was looking
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
at like from preschool early
 
06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
identification I mean what is the scope
 
06:10:30.110 --> 06:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
how are we looking through age 21 or is
 
06:10:31.948 --> 06:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
it preschool to 21 what are we what are
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
we doing here I I wasn't considering
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
preschool um but I I know the child find
 
06:10:43.430 --> 06:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
statutes and everything like that um but
 
06:10:47.310 --> 06:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking really at uh K12 covering
 
06:10:50.270 --> 06:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
through for special edits 21 inclusive
 
06:10:53.590 --> 06:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
point very
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
minor um I
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
I when you're talking about
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
identification for special ed services
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
though is it not true that it includes
 
06:11:08.868 --> 06:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
preschool aged children right via child
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
find and yes um but you know certainly
 
06:11:14.510 --> 06:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
child find um could be you know
 
06:11:16.350 --> 06:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
something else to be looked at you know
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's what is going on with child find
 
06:11:19.830 --> 06:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
in in
 
06:11:23.070 --> 06:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
districts thank you okay thank you you
 
06:11:28.110 --> 06:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
are free thank you can I leave no not
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:48.788 --> 06:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee for
 
06:11:51.990 --> 06:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today um a couple
 
06:11:53.788 --> 06:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
of points and questions that were asked
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
I would just add to um to get that sense
 
06:11:58.910 --> 06:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
of costs and where those costs are
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
coming from right um in terms of the
 
06:12:03.750 --> 06:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
services we provided I would like to
 
06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
throw out a couple other stakeholder
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
groups that you might want to consider
 
06:12:10.590 --> 06:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the composition under your um sorry
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
I'm losing my voice today under your um
 
06:12:16.110 --> 06:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh your committee um section which is I
 
06:12:18.750 --> 06:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
believe um lines 14 through 24 on page
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
one um three stakeholder groups that
 
06:12:23.468 --> 06:12:23.478 align:start position:0%
came to mind as I read through this
 
06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think would be valuable
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
on this commission is um what we call
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
Related services this would be our PT
 
06:12:34.628 --> 06:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
our OT our speech school psychologist
 
06:12:35.628 --> 06:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
even SCH
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
counselor and the reason why I'm
 
06:12:40.468 --> 06:12:40.478 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you consider that as
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
part of your composition of your
 
06:12:44.830 --> 06:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
commission is because these are going to
 
06:12:47.948 --> 06:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
be folks that when you go to page two of
 
06:12:50.510 --> 06:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment and it says um it's line
 
06:12:53.430 --> 06:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
one through three up there with the cost
 
06:12:54.990 --> 06:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
to provide services which are not
 
06:12:57.190 --> 06:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
medically necessary these are the folks
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
that are going to be able to give you
 
06:13:00.910 --> 06:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
some real insights like hey how much
 
06:13:04.750 --> 06:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
does it actually cost for a 30 minute OT
 
06:13:07.390 --> 06:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
session and you guys don't want to hear
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that cost right now I can tell you so I
 
06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
would say something in that realm a
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
couple representatives from your related
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
Services the second stakeholder group
 
06:13:19.628 --> 06:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
that I thought was um would would be a
 
06:13:23.948 --> 06:13:23.958 align:start position:0%
nice crossover and also align um two
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
lines 29 and 30 on page one that was
 
06:13:29.150 --> 06:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
already brought up about um the
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
interventions that are deployed before
 
06:13:34.230 --> 06:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
we do a referral process so I would say
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use an Acron but then I'll
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
say it I would say you want some sort of
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
mtss expert multi-tiered systems of
 
06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
support and we have some really great
 
06:13:48.310 --> 06:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
Folks at the Department of Education in
 
06:13:51.788 --> 06:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
that role so maybe you pull an mtss
 
06:13:54.990 --> 06:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
person from the Department of Education
 
06:13:57.788 --> 06:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
they would really be a nice crossover
 
06:14:00.468 --> 06:14:00.478 align:start position:0%
because this is where I saw in the
 
06:14:02.948 --> 06:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
commission proposal of a crossover
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
between special education and general
 
06:14:09.150 --> 06:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
education um because we do we have very
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
delineated three tier model in our mtss
 
06:14:15.788 --> 06:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
process um and very right we usually
 
06:14:17.548 --> 06:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
before we even go to referral say okay
 
06:14:20.468 --> 06:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
in tier one we did this in tier two in
 
06:14:22.750 --> 06:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
tier three you know and this is why it's
 
06:14:24.990 --> 06:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
not working so I think something from
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
that realm would be good
 
06:14:29.350 --> 06:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
representation and you know me I'm going
 
06:14:31.350 --> 06:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be the voice of Educators I would
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
Advocate that on line 17 it's great we
 
06:14:38.030 --> 06:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
have one special education educator
 
06:14:41.230 --> 06:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
appointed but I I can tell you that
 
06:14:44.230 --> 06:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
special ed services look different at
 
06:14:47.910 --> 06:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
your three major grade bands elementary
 
06:14:50.350 --> 06:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
middle and high school so you might want
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
to think about maybe that could be one
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
special education administrator CU that
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
organization would like put forth a
 
06:15:01.230 --> 06:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
director of student services or
 
06:15:03.150 --> 06:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
something and then maybe a
 
06:15:05.350 --> 06:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative teaching sample of the
 
06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
special ed services that might happen at
 
06:15:10.990 --> 06:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
the grade levels um the only cause for
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
concern I have in the amendment is um
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
online 27 on Page One Part B it says why
 
06:15:23.548 --> 06:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
students may be labeled other health
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
impaired um that is actually defined in
 
06:15:31.030 --> 06:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations I think it's
 
06:15:35.070 --> 06:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
3.8 don't quote me on this might be C9
 
06:15:38.548 --> 06:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
but um it will break down like what we H
 
06:15:42.310 --> 06:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
what the child has to present um in
 
06:15:45.110 --> 06:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
terms of um physical and emotional
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
deficits to qualify for that Ohi so it
 
06:15:51.430 --> 06:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
may be worthy on that line I I agree it
 
06:15:53.948 --> 06:15:53.958 align:start position:0%
would be nice to see a breakdown of
 
06:15:57.070 --> 06:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
which categories in that federal statute
 
06:15:59.990 --> 06:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
are causing more of those Ohi
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
classifications um so maybe something in
 
06:16:05.230 --> 06:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
the language pointing back to that
 
06:16:07.468 --> 06:16:07.478 align:start position:0%
federal statute to say we're going to
 
06:16:11.230 --> 06:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
get the categories from there um uh I
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to agree with representative
 
06:16:15.548 --> 06:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
cordelli um I loved his statement when
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
he said we need to get some of these
 
06:16:20.390 --> 06:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
rules in line with our laws and that is
 
06:16:22.868 --> 06:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
very true that's what we often deal with
 
06:16:25.190 --> 06:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the field is we look at the law we
 
06:16:27.670 --> 06:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
look at the rule and we go wait a minute
 
06:16:29.628 --> 06:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
there's an in congruence here how do we
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
figure this out right and we're kind of
 
06:16:33.430 --> 06:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
caught in the middle um so I think
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
having the commission focused on that um
 
06:16:39.788 --> 06:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
would be really good um the only thing I
 
06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
would offer I mean as a as a a co-author
 
06:16:44.868 --> 06:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
with represent Damon on
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
431 is I wonder about why the complete
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
replacement of 431 for this I think both
 
06:16:55.750 --> 06:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
commissions are valuable and I think
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
studying the cost of special education
 
06:17:00.190 --> 06:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
is important but I also think our
 
06:17:03.750 --> 06:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
commission on 306 is important so I I
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
wonder about the language
 
06:17:08.350 --> 06:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
in the opening part of amend the title
 
06:17:10.990 --> 06:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
or amend the bill by replacing all I
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
mean I'd certainly like to see this as
 
06:17:16.430 --> 06:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment but not in place of the
 
06:17:17.830 --> 06:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
commission for
 
06:17:20.430 --> 06:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
306 thank you are there any
 
06:17:22.548 --> 06:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you madam chairman and
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it it's
 
06:17:30.190 --> 06:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
it's twofold if that's okay please um so
 
06:17:33.310 --> 06:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
the first part is when you mentioned um
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
consider adding under the committee
 
06:17:36.948 --> 06:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
there were three different um
 
06:17:39.390 --> 06:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you mentioned and I I
 
06:17:40.910 --> 06:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
missed it so I I don't know how to word
 
06:17:42.430 --> 06:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
it but you have elementary middle and
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
high school and I have one special
 
06:17:48.110 --> 06:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
education administrator would it be one
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative that covers all three are
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
you saying one from the elementary one
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
from the middle one from the high school
 
06:17:54.628 --> 06:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
I would take one from the elementary one
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
from the middle from the high school and
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
then get an admin a special ed admin
 
06:18:00.990 --> 06:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
because those key players are going to
 
06:18:03.270 --> 06:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
give you much different perspectives
 
06:18:05.548 --> 06:18:05.558 align:start position:0%
that elementary middle or high school
 
06:18:07.750 --> 06:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
special ed teachers going to be able to
 
06:18:09.628 --> 06:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
actually describe to you the services
 
06:18:11.910 --> 06:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
that are happening where that special ed
 
06:18:13.628 --> 06:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
director is then going to be able to say
 
06:18:17.390 --> 06:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
and this comes at a cost of X Y and Z
 
06:18:19.310 --> 06:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
because the teachers don't always get
 
06:18:21.628 --> 06:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
into the weeds with the cost it's the
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
administrators yeah follow yes please
 
06:18:26.670 --> 06:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm going to just make it
 
06:18:28.590 --> 06:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
into a really long run on sentence so I
 
06:18:32.230 --> 06:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
can fit okay both in um so my thoughts
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
my only concern is when we add these
 
06:18:35.310 --> 06:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders which I'm not saying
 
06:18:36.990 --> 06:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's not valid I think the commission
 
06:18:39.390 --> 06:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
goes up to at least 20 people I just
 
06:18:41.150 --> 06:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's like hurting cats
 
06:18:43.030 --> 06:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that being said early
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
intervention um it starts at age three
 
06:18:48.190 --> 06:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
right I'm just I'm drawing a blank at
 
06:18:49.948 --> 06:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
that point that does fall under the
 
06:18:52.948 --> 06:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
umbrella of billing for the taxpayers in
 
06:18:54.910 --> 06:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
the public school level doesn't it and
 
06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay so if it does would we want someone
 
06:19:01.230 --> 06:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
at the preschool level or is Elementary
 
06:19:02.670 --> 06:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
is Elementary
 
06:19:04.830 --> 06:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
Encompass the I'm just asking is
 
06:19:07.590 --> 06:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
Elementary Compass Age 3 to 3 to six so
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
we actually have a couple different
 
06:19:11.150 --> 06:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
certifications around that so we
 
06:19:13.230 --> 06:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
actually have what's called an N through
 
06:19:15.070 --> 06:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
three that's your preschool through
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
three special educator then we actually
 
06:19:20.990 --> 06:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
have a general special education
 
06:19:23.628 --> 06:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
endorsement and we also can do like an
 
06:19:26.270 --> 06:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
elementary aada 6 type endorsement so
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's different endorsements I think
 
06:19:30.750 --> 06:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
whoever you go with you might want to go
 
06:19:32.868 --> 06:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
with somebody that's got the if you're
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
going Elementary that's the true
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
experience of also having preschool with
 
06:19:39.390 --> 06:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
them I don't know if you need to
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
separate out of preschool and an
 
06:19:43.948 --> 06:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
elementary I think you can find people
 
06:19:45.830 --> 06:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
just like if you were concerned about
 
06:19:47.868 --> 06:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
the size of the commission maybe instead
 
06:19:49.590 --> 06:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
of doing elementary middle and high
 
06:19:51.948 --> 06:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
school you do like a and it widens the
 
06:19:55.628 --> 06:19:55.638 align:start position:0%
range a bit you do maybe like a um prek
 
06:19:57.510 --> 06:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
to 8 because we do have a lot of schools
 
06:19:59.310 --> 06:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
still in New Hampshire that are that
 
06:20:01.830 --> 06:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
prek to8 setting um and then you do a
 
06:20:04.990 --> 06:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
high school but I mean that prek to
 
06:20:07.230 --> 06:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
person i' probably want to say they've
 
06:20:09.590 --> 06:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
done a little bit of all of it the early
 
06:20:12.670 --> 06:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
the middle level that kind of thing yeah
 
06:20:14.390 --> 06:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any other question
 
06:20:14.400 --> 06:20:15.708 align:start position:0%
thank you any other question
representative

06:20:15.708 --> 06:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:20:18.830 --> 06:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
wock good afternoon thank for being here
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
um you were consumed with a 306 uh
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
project um not having that background
 
06:20:27.070 --> 06:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
what do you anticipate something of this
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
magnitude might take in time because I
 
06:20:30.390 --> 06:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
know that pres cordelli has I think
 
06:20:31.948 --> 06:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
someone brought up a very aggressive
 
06:20:34.270 --> 06:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
timeline how realistic is that timeline
 
06:20:37.270 --> 06:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
what would you suggest I I think like I
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
said I think this commission is valuable
 
06:20:40.590 --> 06:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
we need to do this study in New
 
06:20:43.948 --> 06:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I think it's very
 
06:20:46.430 --> 06:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
aggressive um and I would be concerned
 
06:20:49.868 --> 06:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
about getting the data um the first
 
06:20:53.708 --> 06:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
report being in November um I I I mean
 
06:20:54.910 --> 06:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
when you think about forming a
 
06:20:56.830 --> 06:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
commission you get everybody in it right
 
06:20:59.190 --> 06:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose you set the parameters the
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
workload and then I mean there's a lot
 
06:21:03.230 --> 06:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
of things that are going to need to be
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
pulled from data and I'm not sure always
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
that data is going to be that easy to
 
06:21:10.270 --> 06:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
pull in some instances um so timeline
 
06:21:13.390 --> 06:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
for me would be I would think at least
 
06:21:15.868 --> 06:21:15.878 align:start position:0%
minimum a first report would be a year
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
from the establishment of the commission
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know I I think also I think
 
06:21:24.270 --> 06:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
of the genocide and Holocaust commission
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
right they are still running um and
 
06:21:30.110 --> 06:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
their purpose has shifted over time and
 
06:21:31.670 --> 06:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
I think this is a commission that could
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
do the same so maybe your first report
 
06:21:37.548 --> 06:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
would come a year later right and then
 
06:21:41.310 --> 06:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps a in year two your goal is to
 
06:21:43.230 --> 06:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
actually recommend and make some
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
substantial changes you know to how it's
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
going on and then I would think the
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
commission would want to shift almost to
 
06:21:52.510 --> 06:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
like a monitoring responsibility like
 
06:21:54.628 --> 06:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay we're making these changes are they
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
making a difference um I think there's
 
06:21:59.110 --> 06:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
some opportunity here um when I spoke
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week about the task force
 
06:22:05.230 --> 06:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
on adequate education right the this is
 
06:22:08.350 --> 06:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
some parallel work here that could come
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
together thank you thank you much Madam
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
06:22:14.868 --> 06:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair thank you to
 
06:22:18.150 --> 06:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question on page two um on the
 
06:22:21.230 --> 06:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
first line I'm I'm not exactly sure and
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping you can give me uh some
 
06:22:25.230 --> 06:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
guidance on this it says the cost to
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
provide services which are not medically
 
06:22:30.430 --> 06:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
necessary as defined by Medicaid um can
 
06:22:32.430 --> 06:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
you tell me what what those Services
 
06:22:35.230 --> 06:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
might be so for example um one service
 
06:22:36.868 --> 06:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
might be and this is why I also said you
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
might want to get that mtss expert onto
 
06:22:42.190 --> 06:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
it so something that's not medically
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't Bill necessary to
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid let's say a student on an IEP
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
has a reading goal and we know the best
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
person in the building to meet that
 
06:22:52.350 --> 06:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
would actually be our certified reading
 
06:22:55.110 --> 06:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
specialist okay so how do you figure out
 
06:22:57.390 --> 06:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the cost of that right
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
towards those Services because that
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
reading specialist is not just a
 
06:23:04.590 --> 06:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
one-on-one to that child but their time
 
06:23:07.548 --> 06:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
time right salary B you you could cost
 
06:23:10.270 --> 06:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
out on a pro-rated ratio what does that
 
06:23:14.110 --> 06:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
cost um and and that's I'm I'm I mean I
 
06:23:16.468 --> 06:23:16.478 align:start position:0%
would defer to representing cordelli but
 
06:23:17.948 --> 06:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
when I read that statement that's what
 
06:23:20.708 --> 06:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
came to my mind is like what can I not
 
06:23:23.310 --> 06:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
Bill to
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid any other
 
06:23:29.628 --> 06:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:23:46.510 --> 06:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:48.830 --> 06:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm
 
06:23:50.430 --> 06:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
the policy director at the disability
 
06:23:52.110 --> 06:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
rights Center New Hampshire's protection
 
06:23:54.310 --> 06:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
and advocacy system for people with
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities I have um been an attorney
 
06:23:58.708 --> 06:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
before being policy director which I've
 
06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
been for about three and a half years or
 
06:24:02.910 --> 06:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
so um I was a senior staff attorney at
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center um
 
06:24:07.390 --> 06:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
beginning in around the fall of 2005 and
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
handled a lot of Special Education cases
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
for parents and children with
 
06:24:12.958 --> 06:24:14.110 align:start position:0%
for parents and children with
educational

06:24:14.110 --> 06:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
educational
 
06:24:18.750 --> 06:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities um so I understand we there
 
06:24:21.910 --> 06:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
are concerns about education funding
 
06:24:24.110 --> 06:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
across the board right and this has been
 
06:24:26.350 --> 06:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
a struggle for our state it's a struggle
 
06:24:28.350 --> 06:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
for your parallel committee to try to
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
figure out what our costs are and how to
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
fund education appropriately it's in the
 
06:24:35.230 --> 06:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
courts it's everywhere um not sure that
 
06:24:37.070 --> 06:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
this commission is going to necessarily
 
06:24:39.150 --> 06:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
get you there and I have some concerns
 
06:24:41.310 --> 06:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
about what it is exactly that this
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
commission would be examining and
 
06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
whether the appropriate voices are all
 
06:24:48.830 --> 06:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
represented on this commission as
 
06:24:53.270 --> 06:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
proposed so um first of all I mean you
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
all know that um education for children
 
06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
with disabilities is you know arises out
 
06:25:02.510 --> 06:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
of a very robust Federal statutory
 
06:25:04.708 --> 06:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
scheme there are federal regulations
 
06:25:07.030 --> 06:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are state laws and state
 
06:25:09.670 --> 06:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
regulations which I need to say are
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
actually valid they're all over 186c
 
06:25:15.230 --> 06:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
there are um indications where the
 
06:25:18.150 --> 06:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education needs to promate
 
06:25:20.468 --> 06:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
rules it's it's replete through the
 
06:25:22.670 --> 06:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
statute like around what child with
 
06:25:24.430 --> 06:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
disability means or what the process is
 
06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
to be identified for Education what's in
 
06:25:28.990 --> 06:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
an IEP there it just all of this is in
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
our statute and the Department of
 
06:25:32.788 --> 06:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
Education is expected to promulgate
 
06:25:35.190 --> 06:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
rules about that just am I bonded about
 
06:25:38.350 --> 06:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
that one so I think that you know it
 
06:25:42.830 --> 06:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to learn more about
 
06:25:45.070 --> 06:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
um and and try to figure out whether we
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
are actually maximizing funding that's
 
06:25:49.590 --> 06:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
available to defay the cost of of
 
06:25:51.590 --> 06:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
special education and related Services I
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
know that right now the Department of
 
06:25:56.030 --> 06:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services is undergoing
 
06:25:57.948 --> 06:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
a transformation on how we do billing
 
06:26:00.990 --> 06:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid to schools and they and so
 
06:26:03.070 --> 06:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
that is changing a bit with a goal I
 
06:26:05.230 --> 06:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
believe to make it a little bit easier
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
and more and have it be a more robust
 
06:26:09.948 --> 06:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
funding source but that is in process as
 
06:26:11.788 --> 06:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
I understand it a more robust funding
 
06:26:14.990 --> 06:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
source for schools um in addition I
 
06:26:16.708 --> 06:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:26:19.510 --> 06:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the um we need to look if we're going
 
06:26:21.708 --> 06:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
to look at funding we also need to look
 
06:26:23.990 --> 06:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
at outcomes are we getting the outcomes
 
06:26:25.548 --> 06:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
that we want and we also need to make
 
06:26:27.548 --> 06:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
sure that parents' voices and the voices
 
06:26:29.788 --> 06:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
of people who are impacted are
 
06:26:31.948 --> 06:26:31.958 align:start position:0%
adequately represented and I would
 
06:26:34.868 --> 06:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
suggest that if I I'm not sure this
 
06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
commission is necessary but if it were
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
necessary I would suggest adding an
 
06:26:41.708 --> 06:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
organization like ours that here advises
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
around 200 parents a year who's and
 
06:26:46.990 --> 06:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
represent some of them in these kinds of
 
06:26:48.628 --> 06:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
in disputes around special education
 
06:26:50.590 --> 06:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
that has been involved in the rul making
 
06:26:52.270 --> 06:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
or parent information center that
 
06:26:54.110 --> 06:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
probably talks to even more parents than
 
06:26:58.030 --> 06:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
we do on special education issues um
 
06:27:00.070 --> 06:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we have sort of knowledge about
 
06:27:02.510 --> 06:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on Statewide in schools and
 
06:27:05.708 --> 06:27:05.718 align:start position:0%
where there might be gaps there are
 
06:27:08.430 --> 06:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of of what this
 
06:27:10.430 --> 06:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
commission would study that are actually
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
available to it already or that can't be
 
06:27:15.270 --> 06:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily changed so for example there
 
06:27:18.230 --> 06:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
is already a definition for what Ohi or
 
06:27:20.708 --> 06:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
other health impairment is that's not
 
06:27:23.750 --> 06:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
something this commission can change um
 
06:27:25.708 --> 06:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
this notion that imple that
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
interventions could be implemented
 
06:27:28.670 --> 06:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
before referral there are times when
 
06:27:30.270 --> 06:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
that would be highly illegal if you
 
06:27:32.270 --> 06:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
already have evaluations that would
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
identify some a student as having an
 
06:27:36.590 --> 06:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
educational disability and requiring
 
06:27:38.868 --> 06:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
special education it would be unlawful
 
06:27:42.510 --> 06:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
to to hold up that child's
 
06:27:42.520 --> 06:27:44.708 align:start position:0%
to to hold up that child's
identification

06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
identification
 
06:27:48.510 --> 06:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that the person who testified
 
06:27:51.150 --> 06:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
that before me talked about how services
 
06:27:53.548 --> 06:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
medical necessity and Medicaid not every
 
06:27:56.548 --> 06:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
student with an IEP is Medicaid eligible
 
06:27:58.830 --> 06:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
not every Educational Service that they
 
06:28:01.708 --> 06:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
receive is a medical service um but if
 
06:28:03.708 --> 06:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's required in their IEP it's required
 
06:28:05.350 --> 06:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
to be Prov provided
 
06:28:07.628 --> 06:28:07.638 align:start position:0%
so just knowing that and knowing that
 
06:28:09.868 --> 06:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of revising how
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
school districts get reimbursed I'm not
 
06:28:14.190 --> 06:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
sure this is a good time to study that
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
particularly um as far as the um
 
06:28:19.830 --> 06:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
comparison of what's required under
 
06:28:22.150 --> 06:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
federal law versus our state law our
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
current state law already requires the
 
06:28:26.310 --> 06:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to file an
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
annual report on any rules that are that
 
06:28:34.150 --> 06:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
exceed the federal minimum rules so that
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
information exists and you all need to
 
06:28:38.430 --> 06:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
know that the rule making process as you
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
know is a very public process there is
 
06:28:43.030 --> 06:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
input there is a lot of work on this and
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
there are really good reasons why some
 
06:28:47.628 --> 06:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
of our rules are different from what is
 
06:28:49.750 --> 06:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the base of in the federal
 
06:28:52.750 --> 06:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and mostly it's to encourage
 
06:28:54.868 --> 06:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
and make it feasible for parents to
 
06:28:56.190 --> 06:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
participate in their children's
 
06:28:58.350 --> 06:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
education we feel it's really important
 
06:29:00.070 --> 06:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
for parents to have a voice in these
 
06:29:01.788 --> 06:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
meetings and to get the information that
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
they need ahead of time so like I said
 
06:29:06.708 --> 06:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
the information is there the rules are
 
06:29:09.230 --> 06:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
there for a reason um and there you know
 
06:29:11.070 --> 06:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
there is a rul making process that takes
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
input um I'm concerned about some of the
 
06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
data being subject to furpa so you'd
 
06:29:19.070 --> 06:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
have to be really careful to make sure
 
06:29:21.110 --> 06:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
furpa is the federal law that protects
 
06:29:22.830 --> 06:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
students educational records
 
06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
confidentiality protections so if you're
 
06:29:28.468 --> 06:29:28.478 align:start position:0%
looking at things like um cost F
 
06:29:30.070 --> 06:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
District placement and whether other
 
06:29:31.868 --> 06:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
options were available I'm not sure what
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
that means but that seems like it could
 
06:29:36.110 --> 06:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
be a bit r risky in terms of identifying
 
06:29:38.910 --> 06:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
students and revealing confidential
 
06:29:38.920 --> 06:29:41.230 align:start position:0%
students and revealing confidential
information

06:29:41.230 --> 06:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:29:43.948 --> 06:29:43.958 align:start position:0%
um I yeah I'm trying I'm looking at some
 
06:29:46.390 --> 06:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
of these other categories um I think
 
06:29:48.750 --> 06:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
that if school districts are paying
 
06:29:50.670 --> 06:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys and using and having insurance
 
06:29:52.510 --> 06:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
I think that information would probably
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
be available under our right to know law
 
06:29:59.628 --> 06:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
um if there those kinds of contracts um
 
06:30:01.230 --> 06:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
would probably be so I think there's
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
other ways to get information like this
 
06:30:07.750 --> 06:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know I I I I think that
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to consider here um it's
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
being considered pretty close to
 
06:30:15.070 --> 06:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
crossover day and when all these
 
06:30:18.430 --> 06:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
decisions have to be made so um I I
 
06:30:21.708 --> 06:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
don't know I think I like I said it
 
06:30:24.510 --> 06:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
raises an eyebrow for me and my office
 
06:30:26.468 --> 06:30:26.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take
 
06:30:29.110 --> 06:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
06:30:31.628 --> 06:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you madam chair I did
 
06:30:35.750 --> 06:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a question this is on page two um
 
06:30:38.948 --> 06:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
line um
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
oh it's regarding the stratification of
 
06:30:44.430 --> 06:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
types of diplomas I've just lost it for
 
06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
a yeah we don't we do report on I mean a
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
diploma is a regular education diploma
 
06:30:52.150 --> 06:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
so that's the only legitimate diploma
 
06:30:54.270 --> 06:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
and what idea looks at and what our
 
06:30:56.350 --> 06:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
state is required to report on already
 
06:30:58.910 --> 06:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
is the percentage of students with IEPs
 
06:31:01.628 --> 06:31:01.638 align:start position:0%
who obtain a regular education diploma
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that's when their eligibility for um
 
06:31:06.230 --> 06:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
um special education would terminate
 
06:31:08.070 --> 06:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
once they achieve that regular Ed
 
06:31:10.350 --> 06:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
diploma so there's not really another
 
06:31:13.310 --> 06:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
diploma similarly um with like due
 
06:31:16.030 --> 06:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
process like I I guess that there was
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
something that passed but the federal
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
law actually requires certain due
 
06:31:22.910 --> 06:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
process for um students and when there
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
are educational disputes Al it requires
 
06:31:27.388 --> 06:31:27.398 align:start position:0%
certain alternative dispute resolution
 
06:31:29.628 --> 06:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
as well as certain um due process
 
06:31:32.350 --> 06:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
procedur so I'm not sure about the value
 
06:31:35.910 --> 06:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
of looking at local or um dispute
 
06:31:37.468 --> 06:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
resolution or if that's even happening
 
06:31:40.910 --> 06:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the state I'm a follow up follow up
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I guess you mentioned fura I also
 
06:31:45.948 --> 06:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
potentially mentioned um Hippa concerns
 
06:31:49.110 --> 06:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe I I I guess I'm just curious
 
06:31:51.868 --> 06:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
about uh with respect to line 17 and
 
06:31:54.190 --> 06:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
identifying the age of a graduate all of
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
these other types of things we could
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
inadvertently be waiting into ter
 
06:32:01.270 --> 06:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
territory that
 
06:32:05.190 --> 06:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
is well yeah sorry I guess it depends on
 
06:32:07.670 --> 06:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
how narrowly you define age like the
 
06:32:09.670 --> 06:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education already report
 
06:32:13.510 --> 06:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
has a standard for um and I let me see
 
06:32:15.150 --> 06:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
if I pulled I tried to pull up their
 
06:32:17.070 --> 06:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
annual report on graduation because I
 
06:32:18.750 --> 06:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
have to reply report it to the federal
 
06:32:19.868 --> 06:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
government let me think it's in the
 
06:32:23.868 --> 06:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:27.070 --> 06:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
up I I think it's the second indicator
 
06:32:27.080 --> 06:32:30.388 align:start position:0%
up I I think it's the second indicator
let's

06:32:30.388 --> 06:32:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:33.030 --> 06:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
see of course I want find aw here we go
 
06:32:34.948 --> 06:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
so indicator one so they look at
 
06:32:37.190 --> 06:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
graduation rates already and I don't
 
06:32:39.070 --> 06:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
know that they do it by age it's a
 
06:32:43.350 --> 06:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
number of Youth
 
06:32:46.868 --> 06:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
graduation per exiting special education
 
06:32:51.110 --> 06:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know they don't look at the number
 
06:32:53.948 --> 06:32:53.958 align:start position:0%
the age of a kid I think they um have to
 
06:32:56.990 --> 06:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
be ages 14 to 21 that's a pretty
 
06:33:00.150 --> 06:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
broad scope um I don't know how much
 
06:33:03.270 --> 06:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
this commission would drill down but it
 
06:33:05.948 --> 06:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
it well might be problematic if it you
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't identify kid in a smaller School
 
06:33:09.788 --> 06:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
District it would be very
 
06:33:12.788 --> 06:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
challenging thank you any other
 
06:33:15.190 --> 06:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
 
06:33:19.150 --> 06:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:19.160 --> 06:33:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
time

06:33:26.270 --> 06:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:28.910 --> 06:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
Beth hi my name is Beth Paige I'm from
 
06:33:30.868 --> 06:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
Anover I'm a special education
 
06:33:32.590 --> 06:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
administrator I have not been doing this
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
for too long only a few years
 
06:33:36.190 --> 06:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
um and I have never spoken in front of a
 
06:33:38.628 --> 06:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
legislative body in in my life so please
 
06:33:41.910 --> 06:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
bear with me um but just from my
 
06:33:43.750 --> 06:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
perspective uh there's been a lot of
 
06:33:45.070 --> 06:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
good points that were made by the ladies
 
06:33:47.230 --> 06:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
that sat here in front of me um there
 
06:33:48.750 --> 06:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
was mention of a state audit which I
 
06:33:49.868 --> 06:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
think is going to be really helpful in
 
06:33:51.150 --> 06:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
answering some of these questions some
 
06:33:53.510 --> 06:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
of these professionals have the the data
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for already and
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
they've spoken to that um I know that
 
06:33:59.310 --> 06:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
special education professionals and
 
06:34:00.910 --> 06:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
administrators could speak directly to
 
06:34:03.708 --> 06:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
the costs and how um it just keeps
 
06:34:06.590 --> 06:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
inflating every year year to year um it
 
06:34:08.150 --> 06:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
feels like a lot of the things that are
 
06:34:11.788 --> 06:34:11.798 align:start position:0%
listed in this amendment um are not in
 
06:34:13.708 --> 06:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
any way related to the original
 
06:34:15.708 --> 06:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
intention of HB
 
06:34:18.788 --> 06:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
431 um this is speaking to creating a
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
commission uh seeking input and I think
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli referred to
 
06:34:25.350 --> 06:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
allowing people to come and voice their
 
06:34:27.150 --> 06:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
opinion in a legislative session of this
 
06:34:29.388 --> 06:34:29.398 align:start position:0%
nature I might be misinterpreting his
 
06:34:32.990 --> 06:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
language but it felt like if if if it's
 
06:34:35.388 --> 06:34:35.398 align:start position:0%
advocated to have more directors at the
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
table who look at the costs dayto day we
 
06:34:39.708 --> 06:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
need to be invited in or find the time
 
06:34:41.670 --> 06:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
in our busy days to come down here and
 
06:34:43.230 --> 06:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
and do such a thing as opposed to be
 
06:34:45.628 --> 06:34:45.638 align:start position:0%
invited equally to the table at the
 
06:34:46.948 --> 06:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
commission which was the point of the
 
06:34:48.468 --> 06:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
representative I can't read your name on
 
06:34:51.150 --> 06:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
your plaque I apologize um I think that
 
06:34:54.230 --> 06:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
is also thank you the case for um the
 
06:34:56.948 --> 06:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
original intent of HB 431 the point was
 
06:34:59.030 --> 06:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
to create a commission to have an equal
 
06:35:01.590 --> 06:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
playing field of of individuals who
 
06:35:05.310 --> 06:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
could continue to uh refine revise and
 
06:35:09.548 --> 06:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
develop our our base um education model
 
06:35:12.110 --> 06:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
um as is appropriate as the years go on
 
06:35:13.590 --> 06:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
um there were a lot of points that were
 
06:35:16.190 --> 06:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
made to specific lines I do find it very
 
06:35:17.590 --> 06:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
interesting that only one special
 
06:35:21.788 --> 06:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
education educator appointed by our um
 
06:35:24.350 --> 06:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
Association the the NAA Association
 
06:35:25.750 --> 06:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be a part of this Commission
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
because those are the people again who
 
06:35:29.868 --> 06:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
are you know monthly I'm required to
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
sign invoices on the contracts that I'm
 
06:35:34.788 --> 06:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
required to sign for all of the services
 
06:35:37.670 --> 06:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
that are in my district so um I don't
 
06:35:39.190 --> 06:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
think that anyone other than those those
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
folks are very aware of what those costs
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
look like and why it is that they're
 
06:35:45.910 --> 06:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
being uh contracted to provide there's
 
06:35:48.070 --> 06:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
some costs that were spoken to earlier
 
06:35:51.110 --> 06:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
um that were regarding line one on page
 
06:35:54.468 --> 06:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
two um services that are not medically
 
06:35:57.310 --> 06:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
necessary that involves a gamut of
 
06:35:59.788 --> 06:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
academic social supports emotional
 
06:36:02.590 --> 06:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
supports which um are not necessarily
 
06:36:05.868 --> 06:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
tied to uh a medical need and to other
 
06:36:07.548 --> 06:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
points that were made earlier not every
 
06:36:09.070 --> 06:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
child qualifies for Medicaid
 
06:36:11.788 --> 06:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so despite um whether not
 
06:36:14.468 --> 06:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
we can get it refunded to us in a a
 
06:36:16.270 --> 06:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
small portion because we do not get the
 
06:36:19.310 --> 06:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
services funded wholly um you know we
 
06:36:21.910 --> 06:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
are required to provide it to to provide
 
06:36:25.388 --> 06:36:25.398 align:start position:0%
that um Vape that's required of us so
 
06:36:27.030 --> 06:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of the points here I'm not
 
06:36:28.388 --> 06:36:28.398 align:start position:0%
sure if it would be useful for me to go
 
06:36:31.388 --> 06:36:31.398 align:start position:0%
through all all all these areas but
 
06:36:34.030 --> 06:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
really I guess my bottom line is that
 
06:36:36.548 --> 06:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
there is definitely a need to look at
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
special education costs I would
 
06:36:39.708 --> 06:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
definitely agree to that there's also
 
06:36:41.150 --> 06:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
definitely a need to establish the
 
06:36:42.628 --> 06:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
commission that was the original intent
 
06:36:46.270 --> 06:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
of HB 431 I think both are valid the
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
content of the amendment here there are
 
06:36:50.788 --> 06:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions here that could be
 
06:36:52.510 --> 06:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
answered by going to your local school
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
board and asking these questions of them
 
06:36:56.910 --> 06:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
going to your local special education
 
06:36:58.430 --> 06:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
administrator and your towns and asking
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
those questions starting those
 
06:37:03.548 --> 06:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
conversations um because you know we we
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
do have policies in place on how it is
 
06:37:07.388 --> 06:37:07.398 align:start position:0%
we determine if a child is other health
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
impaired we agree with you that the
 
06:37:13.030 --> 06:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
increase in referrals since Co is an
 
06:37:15.310 --> 06:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
issue you know um I think there's a lot
 
06:37:17.788 --> 06:37:17.798 align:start position:0%
of points here that are valid but a lot
 
06:37:19.830 --> 06:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
of points that could be answered outside
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:37:24.030 --> 06:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
commission thank you are there any
 
06:37:28.190 --> 06:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:36.110 --> 06:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:38.910 --> 06:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
been a long day for all of you I know uh
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
for the record uh chairwoman Noble and
 
06:37:43.070 --> 06:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony uh for the record
 
06:37:46.910 --> 06:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
Becky Wilson from the New Hampshire
 
06:37:48.750 --> 06:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
school boards Association and to give
 
06:37:51.030 --> 06:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
some context I previously served as a
 
06:37:53.350 --> 06:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
special education administrator for over
 
06:37:57.030 --> 06:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
20 years here in the state um I will not
 
06:37:59.070 --> 06:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
um keep everyone with a long lengthy
 
06:38:00.830 --> 06:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I do just want to point out a
 
06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things um I think it's very
 
06:38:06.190 --> 06:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
important to say and it is critical to
 
06:38:08.388 --> 06:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
remember that the basis of special
 
06:38:11.110 --> 06:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
education is about access to General and
 
06:38:13.590 --> 06:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
regular education the original portion
 
06:38:16.190 --> 06:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
of this bill um was meant to I think
 
06:38:18.670 --> 06:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
address general education and you cannot
 
06:38:21.310 --> 06:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
untangle special education from regular
 
06:38:23.070 --> 06:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
education so the fact that this
 
06:38:25.510 --> 06:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is a replace all I'm not sure
 
06:38:28.708 --> 06:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
that serves anyone very well because
 
06:38:31.948 --> 06:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
you're trying to separate again uh a
 
06:38:33.948 --> 06:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
students uh special special education
 
06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
needs that are impacting their access to
 
06:38:38.270 --> 06:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
general education that is why they are
 
06:38:40.230 --> 06:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
identified as a student who requires
 
06:38:42.788 --> 06:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
special education you cannot completely
 
06:38:44.670 --> 06:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
separate that from general education and
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
look at two things in a silo um that
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
will not that that is not the intention
 
06:38:51.590 --> 06:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
of special education nor is it ever um
 
06:38:53.190 --> 06:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of the aspects that
 
06:38:55.388 --> 06:38:55.398 align:start position:0%
are covered in this amendment are trying
 
06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
to do just that you're trying to really
 
06:39:00.910 --> 06:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
separate out medical needs that are
 
06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
being addressed in the school
 
06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
environment m versus educational needs
 
06:39:08.388 --> 06:39:08.398 align:start position:0%
it seems like that is part of the
 
06:39:10.628 --> 06:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
intention of this I could be wrong um
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
but just in trying to find a thread with
 
06:39:15.628 --> 06:39:15.638 align:start position:0%
all of the aspects that this commission
 
06:39:17.750 --> 06:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
would cover it's difficult to try to
 
06:39:21.388 --> 06:39:21.398 align:start position:0%
figure out what the thread is um there
 
06:39:23.388 --> 06:39:23.398 align:start position:0%
there are some random things that seem
 
06:39:25.590 --> 06:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
to be put into here in terms of I'm not
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
quite sure how they all go together if
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
the thread is not about medical needs of
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
students being addressed in the school
 
06:39:34.590 --> 06:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
setting which I know is a concern of
 
06:39:36.070 --> 06:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
some people on the committee and that's
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
a valid concern if that's what you want
 
06:39:41.110 --> 06:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on but um this particular
 
06:39:43.070 --> 06:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
commission the the areas that they're
 
06:39:45.070 --> 06:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
trying to address I think is a little
 
06:39:49.030 --> 06:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
bit um confusing in that regard um so a
 
06:39:51.150 --> 06:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
couple of things that have not been said
 
06:39:53.708 --> 06:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
referral rates by idea category for
 
06:39:56.948 --> 06:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
special education programs um students
 
06:39:59.590 --> 06:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
are not categorized when they are
 
06:40:01.468 --> 06:40:01.478 align:start position:0%
referred they are referred to special
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
education so that you can determine as a
 
06:40:05.548 --> 06:40:05.558 align:start position:0%
team what if any special education needs
 
06:40:08.430 --> 06:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
they have and if so what eligibility
 
06:40:10.030 --> 06:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
criteria they may meet and which
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
category of disability they may fall
 
06:40:14.910 --> 06:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
under there are no referral rates by
 
06:40:18.270 --> 06:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
category um so that's not a term that I
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
think people in the field would use uh
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to look at the outcomes
 
06:40:25.868 --> 06:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
of evaluations or determinations of
 
06:40:27.708 --> 06:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
Eligibility that might be a little bit
 
06:40:30.990 --> 06:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
different um but I'm pretty sure that
 
06:40:32.910 --> 06:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
over the last several sessions there
 
06:40:35.350 --> 06:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
have been lots of bills looking at
 
06:40:39.510 --> 06:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
categories of idea um designation uh
 
06:40:40.990 --> 06:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
because we've been talking about
 
06:40:42.670 --> 06:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
education funding as related to the
 
06:40:44.190 --> 06:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
different categories for I don't know
 
06:40:46.150 --> 06:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
probably six to eight years I would
 
06:40:48.948 --> 06:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
imagine um so that information is
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
available um but you are not as a team
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
intentionally not trying to refer a
 
06:40:57.990 --> 06:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
student based on some specific category
 
06:40:59.750 --> 06:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
um why students may be labeled other
 
06:41:01.230 --> 06:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
health impaired again it's been said
 
06:41:03.468 --> 06:41:03.478 align:start position:0%
multiple times every single category and
 
06:41:05.230 --> 06:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
special education in the state has a
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
determination eligibility form that lays
 
06:41:09.628 --> 06:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
out the criteria that the student has to
 
06:41:11.388 --> 06:41:11.398 align:start position:0%
meet in order to be identified under
 
06:41:14.070 --> 06:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
that category there's 13 different
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
categories 13 different deliberations I
 
06:41:18.590 --> 06:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
can share those with Jen and I'm sure
 
06:41:20.190 --> 06:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
she can share them with you I thought I
 
06:41:21.628 --> 06:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
already had shared them but I think that
 
06:41:23.110 --> 06:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
was with the other education committee
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a little confused with all
 
06:41:27.868 --> 06:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
the Committees um the increase in
 
06:41:30.388 --> 06:41:30.398 align:start position:0%
referrals since covid closures I mean we
 
06:41:32.590 --> 06:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
have talked a lot about this as well and
 
06:41:34.670 --> 06:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind the committee that
 
06:41:36.548 --> 06:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
while the school buildings were closed
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was actually at the
 
06:41:39.510 --> 06:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
Forefront of providing remote
 
06:41:41.670 --> 06:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
instruction School itself was open
 
06:41:44.548 --> 06:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
during covid there were I and again I
 
06:41:45.948 --> 06:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
would have to go in the way back machine
 
06:41:48.230 --> 06:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
to really pull all this information but
 
06:41:50.030 --> 06:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
I there were very few schools that
 
06:41:52.350 --> 06:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
provided nothing um whereas in other
 
06:41:54.590 --> 06:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
states there were quite a few um states
 
06:41:55.990 --> 06:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
that were not prepared for that
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
situation in terms of remote instruction
 
06:41:59.270 --> 06:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire actually had been
 
06:42:00.910 --> 06:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of training at the
 
06:42:02.590 --> 06:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
department of Ed on remote instruction
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
prior to co so while the school
 
06:42:05.948 --> 06:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
buildings were closed and that certainly
 
06:42:08.270 --> 06:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
has had a lot of impact on students and
 
06:42:10.948 --> 06:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
staff and families um School itself was
 
06:42:12.468 --> 06:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
not closed so you might want to get a
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
little clarification if that's an area
 
06:42:17.388 --> 06:42:17.398 align:start position:0%
that you want to um study if this
 
06:42:20.670 --> 06:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
amendment were to go forward
 
06:42:22.830 --> 06:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
um but somebody already spoke about
 
06:42:24.548 --> 06:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
interventions that can be implemented
 
06:42:26.708 --> 06:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
prior to referrals um that is something
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
that is considered um when students are
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
referred for special education whether
 
06:42:32.310 --> 06:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
or not interventions have been tried and
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
if so what was the students response um
 
06:42:35.830 --> 06:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of that has come out of this
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature in terms of mtss RTI trying
 
06:42:40.830 --> 06:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
those different things to make sure you
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
are identifying students based on their
 
06:42:47.310 --> 06:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
actual needs and not on a uh hole in the
 
06:42:49.270 --> 06:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
system for example or lack of
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate instruction and that's
 
06:42:52.350 --> 06:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
something that has to be considered for
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
every single deliberation whether or not
 
06:42:55.788 --> 06:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
the student has had access to
 
06:42:58.830 --> 06:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate instruction so um medically
 
06:43:01.070 --> 06:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
necessary I think we've beat that dead
 
06:43:03.708 --> 06:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
horse enough today um not all services
 
06:43:05.788 --> 06:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
are medically necessary and and Medicaid
 
06:43:07.388 --> 06:43:07.398 align:start position:0%
to schools is a completely different
 
06:43:09.430 --> 06:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
program that has nothing to do with
 
06:43:11.590 --> 06:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
Educational Services it has to do with
 
06:43:13.548 --> 06:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
medically necessary Services provided in
 
06:43:16.468 --> 06:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
a school setting um the rules and exess
 
06:43:19.468 --> 06:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
chart already exists um I don't know in
 
06:43:22.190 --> 06:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
terms of uh letter G the district
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
resport reporting of costs to the
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed I don't know what the
 
06:43:27.990 --> 06:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
department of Ed feels maybe are costs
 
06:43:29.590 --> 06:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
that they are missing or they're not
 
06:43:31.230 --> 06:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
currently getting them or is it the
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
collection that they're not getting them
 
06:43:36.030 --> 06:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
um also the Department's not part of the
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
IEP team and the IEP team has to make
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
decisions based on children's needs and
 
06:43:42.910 --> 06:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
not on cost that is at the Forefront of
 
06:43:45.190 --> 06:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
those so the department wouldn't be
 
06:43:47.310 --> 06:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
getting those costs and team shouldn't
 
06:43:49.350 --> 06:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
be making decisions solely based on cost
 
06:43:53.150 --> 06:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
either so um that's a little bit of a
 
06:43:55.910 --> 06:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
difficult sweet spot to find I believe
 
06:43:57.150 --> 06:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
somebody already talked about out of
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
District placement and if a student goes
 
06:44:00.150 --> 06:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
to out of District placement it's
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
because the team has has considered
 
06:44:03.990 --> 06:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
other options and has decided that they
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
can't meet the students needs in those
 
06:44:07.708 --> 06:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
options so yes other options are
 
06:44:09.070 --> 06:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
available and the team has already
 
06:44:11.910 --> 06:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
decided they're not appropriate um
 
06:44:14.868 --> 06:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
locally District dispute resolutions
 
06:44:16.750 --> 06:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
that bill just passed this committee
 
06:44:19.708 --> 06:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
last session um so the school's been in
 
06:44:21.190 --> 06:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
session for six months I'm not sure how
 
06:44:23.788 --> 06:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
much viable information you would have
 
06:44:27.150 --> 06:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
in that time um I won't just keep going
 
06:44:29.310 --> 06:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
through this and going through this um
 
06:44:31.868 --> 06:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
however graduation rates as well um yes
 
06:44:33.788 --> 06:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
that information is available
 
06:44:36.510 --> 06:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
um there's 13 to 15 indicators that
 
06:44:38.230 --> 06:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
every single district is rated on every
 
06:44:39.910 --> 06:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
year in terms of special education it's
 
06:44:41.388 --> 06:44:41.398 align:start position:0%
available online for every single
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
District graduation rate is one of them
 
06:44:45.868 --> 06:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
um you can get graduation rate for
 
06:44:47.468 --> 06:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
students who are identified with
 
06:44:49.110 --> 06:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities you can get graduation rate
 
06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
for your whole District you can get
 
06:44:52.030 --> 06:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
number of students who graduated with
 
06:44:53.590 --> 06:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
their cohort which means in the four
 
06:44:55.708 --> 06:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
years versus students that graduated
 
06:44:57.750 --> 06:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
with a regular high school diploma but
 
06:44:59.868 --> 06:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
took longer than four years you can get
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
all of that information so um I'll just
 
06:45:05.030 --> 06:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I don't think you can
 
06:45:07.548 --> 06:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
separate special education needs from
 
06:45:09.310 --> 06:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
general education needs and so if
 
06:45:11.430 --> 06:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
anything if this amendment were to go
 
06:45:14.868 --> 06:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
forward um I would you know advocate for
 
06:45:17.430 --> 06:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
trying to keep both things you need to
 
06:45:19.310 --> 06:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
look at the General Ed system and if you
 
06:45:20.830 --> 06:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a strong General Ed system you will
 
06:45:23.150 --> 06:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
have a better special education system
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
the reason a lot of times that you have
 
06:45:27.510 --> 06:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
inflated special education is because of
 
06:45:29.910 --> 06:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
a lack of strong regular Ed and if you
 
06:45:31.708 --> 06:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
don't have strong regular Ed the
 
06:45:34.190 --> 06:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
students are going to show needs that
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps are um maybe not as closely tied
 
06:45:41.030 --> 06:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
to special education as they could be
 
06:45:42.510 --> 06:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions although
 
06:45:45.590 --> 06:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you don't want to ask
 
06:45:48.830 --> 06:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
many thank you representative Murray
 
06:45:50.548 --> 06:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Noble I did
 
06:45:52.230 --> 06:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I was clear
 
06:45:55.230 --> 06:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
in understanding that you do or do not
 
06:45:57.030 --> 06:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
concur with the fact that there is not a
 
06:45:59.430 --> 06:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
segregated type of diploma for children
 
06:46:01.948 --> 06:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
correct it is a general diploma thank
 
06:46:03.468 --> 06:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
you for the question represent ative
 
06:46:06.110 --> 06:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
some districts um offer an alternative
 
06:46:07.948 --> 06:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
diploma that is a district diploma
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
versus the state diploma there's still
 
06:46:12.590 --> 06:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that the the diploma has to
 
06:46:14.230 --> 06:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
meet however in terms of special
 
06:46:16.468 --> 06:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
education the student is eligible to
 
06:46:18.350 --> 06:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
remain in the school system or get
 
06:46:20.270 --> 06:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
special education services until they
 
06:46:22.670 --> 06:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
obtain a regular high school diploma or
 
06:46:25.388 --> 06:46:25.398 align:start position:0%
they turn 22 that even if they were to
 
06:46:28.388 --> 06:46:28.398 align:start position:0%
get their GED or their highet or some
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
alternative diploma they would still be
 
06:46:31.868 --> 06:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive services and the
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
school district would need to provide
 
06:46:35.070 --> 06:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
those until they get a regular Ed
 
06:46:37.468 --> 06:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
diploma you're welcome representative
 
06:46:40.388 --> 06:46:40.398 align:start position:0%
wuk thank you um Mr Wilson thank you for
 
06:46:43.468 --> 06:46:43.478 align:start position:0%
being here are saying this along um
 
06:46:44.990 --> 06:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
based on your knowledge of special Aid
 
06:46:48.230 --> 06:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
which is you know huge um and looking at
 
06:46:50.708 --> 06:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
the the the uh magnitude of this
 
06:46:53.030 --> 06:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
commission's responsibilities in in
 
06:46:54.628 --> 06:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
investigation how long do you think it
 
06:46:56.548 --> 06:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
would take to approximately do an
 
06:46:58.750 --> 06:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
adequate job I guess I'm concerned about
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
the timelines we' talked about before
 
06:47:02.430 --> 06:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
what in your ballpark what would you
 
06:47:03.388 --> 06:47:03.398 align:start position:0%
think in
 
06:47:04.388 --> 06:47:04.398 align:start position:0%
now thank you for the question
 
06:47:06.430 --> 06:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I I think
 
06:47:08.430 --> 06:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
there's a two things that I would
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
consider one is the fact that somebody
 
06:47:11.548 --> 06:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
else already mentioned Medicaid to
 
06:47:13.510 --> 06:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
schools is undergoing an enormous
 
06:47:15.388 --> 06:47:15.398 align:start position:0%
overhaul right now which is going to
 
06:47:17.670 --> 06:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
change to cost-based reporting which is
 
06:47:19.910 --> 06:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to allow districts to actually
 
06:47:22.590 --> 06:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
recoup the actual cost of what they are
 
06:47:24.670 --> 06:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
spending that is not set to go into
 
06:47:26.990 --> 06:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
place until 2026 school year and there
 
06:47:28.510 --> 06:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
is a lot of training that is supposed to
 
06:47:31.070 --> 06:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
be happening at the district level
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
between this summer and next the 2026
 
06:47:37.468 --> 06:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
summer um through DHHS that RFP went to
 
06:47:39.548 --> 06:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
governor and Council months ago and I
 
06:47:43.788 --> 06:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
think that has been secured um so if
 
06:47:45.628 --> 06:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
nothing else because so many of these
 
06:47:47.350 --> 06:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
questions are related to Medicaid and
 
06:47:49.708 --> 06:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid type questions I would suggest
 
06:47:52.150 --> 06:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
waiting until that is up and going
 
06:47:53.948 --> 06:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
because right now if you were to pull
 
06:47:55.388 --> 06:47:55.398 align:start position:0%
this commission together and try to get
 
06:47:57.990 --> 06:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
something out you are what's reimbursed
 
06:47:59.788 --> 06:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid or what districts are paying
 
06:48:02.388 --> 06:48:02.398 align:start position:0%
Etc is based on the Medicaid rates which
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
are set by insurance by Medicaid they
 
06:48:06.910 --> 06:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with what schools are
 
06:48:10.230 --> 06:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
actually paying so they're being tracked
 
06:48:11.708 --> 06:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
that way so you're not going to get
 
06:48:15.750 --> 06:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
great answers um you know you've got
 
06:48:17.788 --> 06:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
again I think multiple Pathways in this
 
06:48:19.190 --> 06:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
commission that you're looking at you're
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
looking sort of at like programmatic
 
06:48:22.628 --> 06:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
things that are being offered at the
 
06:48:24.310 --> 06:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
school you're looking at Medicaid to
 
06:48:28.150 --> 06:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
schools um so at least a year at least a
 
06:48:31.830 --> 06:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
year if from from the fall two years I
 
06:48:33.628 --> 06:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know by the end of the
 
06:48:36.070 --> 06:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
session I it's a very it's a lot of
 
06:48:39.430 --> 06:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions um and education funding I is
 
06:48:42.110 --> 06:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
also asking and doing a lot of this work
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
already so I don't know if you're
 
06:48:45.948 --> 06:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
creating sort of a competitive
 
06:48:48.270 --> 06:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
commission with what the other housed
 
06:48:50.510 --> 06:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee is also already
 
06:48:52.548 --> 06:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
addressing thank you representative
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you madam chair um I I
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm understanding
 
06:48:58.910 --> 06:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
correctly too is it your statement that
 
06:49:01.190 --> 06:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
potentially we could spend all this time
 
06:49:03.510 --> 06:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
energy money and resources into to
 
06:49:05.948 --> 06:49:05.958 align:start position:0%
getting all of this data and then our
 
06:49:08.070 --> 06:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid overhaul sort of hasn't
 
06:49:10.270 --> 06:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
even really launched yet so this could
 
06:49:12.750 --> 06:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
potentially provide misleading
 
06:49:16.070 --> 06:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
information that is not fully capturing
 
06:49:18.150 --> 06:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
the new changes thank you for the
 
06:49:20.910 --> 06:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
question represent Mari yes as in
 
06:49:22.510 --> 06:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
regards to the questions in this
 
06:49:23.990 --> 06:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
commission that are addressing Medicaid
 
06:49:25.948 --> 06:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
to schools it's going to change who has
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
to report how they report what they're
 
06:49:30.990 --> 06:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
asking to be reimbursed for um who's
 
06:49:33.030 --> 06:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
doing the billing all of those pie and
 
06:49:34.510 --> 06:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
some of that you know is addressed in
 
06:49:36.310 --> 06:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
this commission so it certainly would
 
06:49:37.750 --> 06:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
impact all of
 
06:49:39.708 --> 06:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
that any other
 
06:49:42.430 --> 06:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:49:47.230 --> 06:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:55.750 --> 06:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:06.030 --> 06:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%

bill to be withdrawn since the amendment
 
06:50:27.628 --> 06:50:27.638 align:start position:0%

original version of HP 431 which I hope
 
06:50:42.350 --> 06:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
to bring back next year and have a more
 
06:50:45.070 --> 06:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
productive legislative process so we can
 
06:50:46.628 --> 06:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
actually look at making a commission
 
06:50:49.548 --> 06:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
happen on the 306 rules and
 
06:50:52.230 --> 06:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
