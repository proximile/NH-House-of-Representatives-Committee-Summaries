00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards but he decided to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
I will uh entertain a motion to accept
 
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
minutes gray move second I'll second it
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
but I have a comment you now we may
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
comment okay um I I I don't know if our
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
regular minute format handles this of
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
course I was absent last time um but it
 
00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
it it bugs me to not do my job uh I I
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
was out on a medical FL so if there is a
 
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
a way to condition the kind of absence
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
or or qualify it I I'd appreciate
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
it okay if the clerk would add that and
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
I gave you those who had already called
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
in with excused
 
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor of
 
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
abstain I was not here
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
same okay so you cannot find any errors
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the last meeting
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
then no I
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
cannot I have no idea what the rules are
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
on these committees but generally
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
speaking house members aren't allowed to
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
abstain from things it it may be fine I
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't know I wasn't here either but I'm
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
going to vote Yes because I think
 
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
they're probably okay okay so if if the
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
rules allow it representative Merchant
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
abstains if they don't he vot votes yes
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
just as a a point the Senate operates
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
under Robert's Rules you guys under a
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
different set of rules but Robert's
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
Rules would allow you to vote in favor
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
or against am minutes whether you were
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
there or not based on your knowledge of
 
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
what went on either through you know
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
hearsay watching a video or whatever so
 
00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly have no problem with them
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
voting or not voting as they choose Mr
 
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
chair I I because of Robert I will vote
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you as it quaz I Robert I'll
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
vote Yes okay I like Bob I'll go yes
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
too I was given Masons for Christmas so
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have to reread that section but
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
I think we've approved the minutes uh
 
00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
the nomination next item nomination of
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
Jay Gupta director of Pharmacy and
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
Integrative Health Harvard care in New
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an adjunct member to serve
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee of this group on
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
Alim disease and other related dementia
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
Mr gup to
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
here representative Merchant would you
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
speak to him as a fellow pharmacist I I
 
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.629 align:start position:0%
speak to him as a fellow pharmacist I I
will

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
um Mr Gupta comes to us with an
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
extensive background both as a
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacist as well as somebody who
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
worked in the industry and he also has
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
spearheaded a lot of things at Harbor
 
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
care dealing with Pharmacy coverage and
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
working with patients and trying to
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
allow them to get coverage that they
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
need drastically so he's very first in
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
the issue of trying to understand the
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy world and trying to migrate
 
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.110 align:start position:0%
pharmacy world and trying to migrate
patients

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
from the need of drug therapy and
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
finding ways to get that taken care of
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
by the payers or finding sources for
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
them to do the I think we get into
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's we're going to have the same
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
issue because a lot of the drugs are
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
expensive and a lot of the ways in which
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
patients will access the pharmaceutical
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
care we've predicated upon that access
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
point so I therefore bring him to our
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee as adjunct to the committee
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you uh this was a
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that is on the in in the
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
law books and in the seven years I've
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
been in the house had not met but people
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
had come to me and said we'd like to
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
crank it up again so we did uh there
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
were a few people that some of us felt
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
should have been named as regular
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
members but the people who got named to
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
their slots were equally good so what to
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
do well they could just come they could
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
just show up if they wanted to but I
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to recognize um pharmacist Gap
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
and also Dr Jeffrey
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
Solway in a little special way so they
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
are not voting members but they will be
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
participating members to the degree the
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
chair um allows that so that's the
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
backstory to
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
that um next item and I'm going to ask
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
that um next item and I'm going to ask
if

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's the chair's nomination
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
but if you'd like to vote chair's nomin
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so then we don't need a
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
vote but had it not been would you have
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
voted yes I certainly I thought so next
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
if um attorney Edwards would explain
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
what the next section is please
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
Williams you
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
said did you Williams I said Edwards but
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
I meant Williams you both knew
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
that chairman parison members of the
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee we worked together for so long
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
that I absolutely knew exactly who he
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
was referring to um so thank you very
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
much I tried really hard not to insult
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
you by calling you representative this
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
time I don't have a response but with
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
that um we I I want to thank you for
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to be a resource to the
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee um uh chairman Pearson uh
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
working uh along with the Department
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
were able to identify legislation that
 
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
pass pass this um past session that uh
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
includes uh items that were either for
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
new reports or for Action items for for
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
this committee I Look to um represent
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
Edwards as the chair division three who
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
very thoughtfully during the budget
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
process identified certain areas where
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh the subject matter that is gerain to
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
this committee would have some type of
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
either a reporting item or some type of
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
review or review and approval so what
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
you have as part of your agenda when you
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
see it is a kind of a reduced down
 
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
version of the number of items that were
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
past the session I will say since I've
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
been doing this I've never seen four
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
pages worth you do have a a more uh
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
annotated document that gives you the
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
background over the types of items that
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
have been added for this committee's
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
review but certainly uh you've met a
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
benchmark of quite a few items that have
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
been passed this past session so I don't
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
know how you would like to handle it
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
because there's only 15 minutes to
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
review all the items of for particular
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on you know
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
certain items just to scan over and
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
certainly uh if I not able to respond I
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
know we do have members uh from the
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
Department in the audience who could
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
also uh participate but today is a
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
review uh of the items that were passed
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the actual review themselves
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
those are being calendared for uh review
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
by this committee or on on the agenda
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
there is one item I would point out that
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
director Wendy Alman uh with our
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and Services the
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau of elderly and Adult Services I
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
will be here today to present the plan
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
as it relates to an awareness campaign
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
around Alzheimer's and and related
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
dementia and so that is one of the items
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
on this list that is scheduled for your
 
00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:47.230 align:start position:0%
on this list that is scheduled for your
review

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
today some of these will naturally be
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
showing up on our schedule our agenda
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
correct yes naturally and since that's
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
the case do we we simply wait for them
 
00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
to show up uh and is what we're now
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
doing looking for the ones that might
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
not naturally show up to ask them to
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
show up is that what you
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggest I I don't believe that's what
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting because I think this
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee has done a a very good job of
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
keeping a matrix of all of the reporting
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
requirements we certainly uh do add
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
those um it's interesting though that is
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
a good question uh for the chair uh on
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement on many of the
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
reports to actually present uh but we
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
have historically done that and so we've
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
had members not only from the department
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
but you'll also see on the list of the
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
new requirements that there's other
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
agencies like the uh um in this case the
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has now been charged
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
with workplace safety in clinical
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
settings they're added to the list um
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
you also have the office of professional
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
life insurance certification I believe
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
that there's an reporting item for them
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
or at least a review item uh for for
 
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.670 align:start position:0%
or at least a review item uh for for
those

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
groups so are you suggesting we read
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
down the list and when we see something
 
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.670 align:start position:0%
down the list and when we see something
interesting

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
what however you'd like to handle the
 
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
what however you'd like to handle the
review

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
I um yes please suggestion thank you my
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be and thank you very
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
much for this is a resource because it's
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
really useful so thanks to both of you
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
who generated it that perhaps we could
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
save time by taking it away with us and
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
coming back next month with any
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions about action items for
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't fall into the into
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
our natural rotation but Mr chairman I
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
also wanted to make a Express a concern
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
because uh our agendas have become
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
Fuller and Fuller and fitting it all
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
into two hours once a month is
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
apparently become harder and harder and
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
whether we ought as a committee and not
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily today to think about either
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
setting a longer time block or meeting
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
more often because I'm really worried
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a huge docket of really
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
important things to go over and I don't
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
want any of them to get short shrift so
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
I just throw that out as a suggestion
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
once once we add these onto our already
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
full docket um I'm I'm concerned that
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to fall farther and farther
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
behind or we're not going to be as
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
thorough as we have traditionally been
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weber was one of my good
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
mentors when I first became a committee
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and she's continuing to do so
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
so might I suggest uh what do you think
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
chair and I I I endorse what uh
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber just said U uh I
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
was just going to suggest that as a as a
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
rule uh that the depart since the
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
department knows which of these areas
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
that oversight has some accountability
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
for getting involved with that a
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
management by exception approach be
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
initiated so that if we're out of cycle
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
from a report and something seems to be
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
going wrong or a skew that we ought to
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
be aware of to go ahead and take the
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
initiative to to bring it to the
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee and let us know that that that
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
would be one thing that I would want to
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
do and then I I have a second comment if
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
you'll allow follow up okay at at this
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
point would it be inappropriate if I
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
asked what I would hope to be a short
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
answer um uh regarding one of these
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
items like okay so um Mr Williams um hb2
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
on the healthc care workplace violence
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
prevention program um did what the
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner had asked we we um put into
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
suspense for this budget period DHHS is
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to basically provide some
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
leadership and some database work and
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
some other things um and when we did
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
that the intent and hope was was that
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
the private sector would stand up and
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
make it happen without the government
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
involved do you have any idea if the
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
private sector is stepping into that
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
vacuum and and chairman if I can respond
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
to represent Edward's question well on
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
on your first item that you you did
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
bring up I just wanted to respond uh
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
about bringing emergent issues or
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
bringing reports to this uh committee we
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
have historically worked very closely
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
with this committee uh and and certainly
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
those items as matter practice have been
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
brought before the committee so that's
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
this first item so great idea is
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
something that we've already been
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
adhering to the the next item is where
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
we are around this very important
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
workplace uh group and I know there's
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
members of the audience who are feeling
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
a gravitational poll who are not
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the Department uh that
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
work for perhaps hospitals and other
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
associations but you may recall in in
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
Senator gray uh you were very much
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
instrumental in the first bill that
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
created the workplace safety commission
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
and the concern that we had and the
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
reason why the original Bill had its
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
effective date pushed out was to allow
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
our agency to respond with building into
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
the budget the necessary resources to do
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
the data analytics that were required as
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
part of that proposal as the bill made
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
its way back through the legislative
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
process in this in the budget cycle and
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
working with division 3 and working with
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
you as the chair of that committee
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards we were able to work
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
very collaboratively with the Department
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
of Labor and they were more than
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
gracious to accept the responsibility to
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
having the work administratively
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
attached to them we certainly are an
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
important player particularly because we
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
do have institutions like New Hampshire
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
hospital Hamstead hospital um
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities and and
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
others that certainly we certainly
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
benefit uh from the work of that group
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the data to keeping our staff safe
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh but it's now housed with the
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so that's one of the
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
items that I actually mentioned that
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
your new deliverables in terms of folks
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
coming before you have been expanded
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
well okay so as I summarize what you
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
just said is that DHHS has suspended
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
their leadership of this program it's
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
the it's been transferred informally
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
over to the Department of Labor and that
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
makes me think uh that we may need uh a
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislative tweak
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
and if we need a legislative tweak to
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
pin the row on labor um let me know and
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'll try to figure out how to do
 
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
and I I'll try to figure out how to do
that

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
tweak and chairman I I just wanted to
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood when you I think
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
I heard the word inally uh if if that
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
was the word and I apologize because
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I I it was actually formally done
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
as part of the legislation um that came
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
out through the budget process to
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
realign with the Department of Labor
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
from our agency however notwithstanding
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
all of that uh the commissioner uh Ken
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
Maryfield is certainly a wonderful
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
person to work with very collaboratively
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
with and we look forward to the
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue working with him
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
this is an important commission for the
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
department and we do serve on the
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
commission we're active participants the
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
transfer however to the Department of
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
Labor because they deal with labor
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues and workplace safety issues that
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
it was better housed with them and we
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
really appreciate them stepping up uh I
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
do believe and I'd have to look back at
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 but I do believe there were some
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
additional resources either in hb2 or in
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
the operating budget that was provided
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
to support this program in the data
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
analytics and and again I know we have
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
people in the audience and but with the
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
brevity of time I probably shouldn't be
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
gravitationally pulling anybody up at
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
this moment from other outside entities
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor I the chair would
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
like to take up representative Weber's
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we look down this list
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
and ponder it for the next month and
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
talk in a 91a respectful manner amongst
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves that uh we could perhaps come
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
back with uh a few further
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts um also just before we get too
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
far away I want to thank um uh attorney
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh Williams because he's putting
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
suggested limits on time which is why we
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
ad adjourned last time right at 12:00
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
with a big agenda it's it's encouraging
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
us to time discipline and thank so thank
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
you for coming up yeah you're quite
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
welcome and ironically we are on time
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
even though I think my commentary went
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit too long thank you
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wish to bring up
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
before I forget it this is triggered by
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
the nomination of somebody to a
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I've been approached by
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
somebody saying there's other
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are lurking in the
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
law somewhere that come out of DHHS
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that maybe want to
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
be reassembled and I'm quite open to
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
bringing that forward to this group just
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
if if uh the one I spoke to earlier has
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
anything further please speak to me
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
afterwards uh anybody else hearing this
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
um if there are other subcommittees that
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
should be meeting and you want to meet
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
me next
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
page um
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%

Jersey Jeff who replaced Jersey Joe uh
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
we've got a good pipeline down there to
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
New Jersey and it's doing DCF a good
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing so welcome both of you great thank
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
you so much um for your kind words um
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner sends her regards
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
as well um and her regrets that she's
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
not able to be here today um you know
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
occasionally when you're in a in have
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
the privilege of being in a position of
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
executive leadership you post a job and
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
um an applicant comes along and you say
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the person we need for
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
this role right now um and I believe
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
that is what happened to us now six
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
seven years ago when Joe ribom came
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
along as dcyf director over the course
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
of 5 years um
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
transforming and I and I mean that
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
cliche word with no degree of um
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
overstatement our child welfare and
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice systems and with the
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
announcement of Joe moving on um to a
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
different role at a national level when
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
I received Jeff fler resume and I think
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
I responded in maybe five minutes um
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
which he kids me about a little bit now
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
um it was clear that this was exactly
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
the person to continue building on the
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
foundation um that has come before while
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
moving Us in um even more positive
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
directions for kids and families and so
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
um at your request wanted to give Jeff a
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
few minutes to introduce himself talk a
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about his vision um I want to
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
acknowledge traditionally um DCF has
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually reported up to Children's
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
oversight commission led by Senator
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
Carson and uh as its kind of oversight
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
body but part of the beauty of the
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
direction that um we've been headed with
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
DCF is that um the entire program the
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
efforts Jeff is now taking the Helm of
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
and leading are really um are really
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
understood in a in a paradigm that is
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
side by side with health and especially
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and so one of the best
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
um symbols of that has been Jeff at
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
Children's oversight which happened last
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
Friday sitting side by side with Kya Fox
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
our director of the division for
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health co-presenting
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
co-leading um so much of what needs to
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
be integrated across the department to
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
um help families and kids get what they
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
need so so without further Ado I want to
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
introduce Jeff I'll just say by way of
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
um background he has nearly 40 years of
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
experience leading one of the nation and
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
really the world's um most respected
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofits the youth advocacy program
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
which um is entirely geared around
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
helping kids families get the services
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
they need and um in many cases in most
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
cases altogether avoid the need for um
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
acute levels of care residential
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
detention Etc which of course is where
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is a lead and continues
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
to go so with that want to give Jeff a
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
chance to introduce himself his
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
background and um his vision and then
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
I you go that's the hardest part of the
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
job is making sure the lights on and you

Commissioner except I need she was my
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%

yeah um just uh thanks for inviting me
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
just to spend a couple of minutes with

you um as Marissa said I spent uh 47
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
years of my career running Community
 
00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:09.470 align:start position:0%
years of my career running Community
Based

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
Based
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um and the last 38
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
specifically alternatives to Youth
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
detention youth incarceration
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment and acute psych
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals developing community- based
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
organizations um and Community Based
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
plans as an alternative to those
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
high-end uh at home placements also did
 
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work in gang intervention
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
in about 30 of our major cities across
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
the state Chicago Philadelphia Baltimore
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
um New York New Jersey where I'm from
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
and many others and also many rural
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
areas uh in Arizona and Alabama and
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
Upstate New York and other places so uh
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
I was very uh interested and I was a big
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
fan of Joe and um the the amazing array
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
of services that were built here over
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
the Last 5 Years millions of dollars in
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
new programs um that the legislature and
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
DHHS really developed for our high-risk
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
kids here in the community so my goal uh
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
my overwatching goal is to really build
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
upon the strengths of the of the
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
existing community-based system of
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
care um and uh fill in the blanks fill
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
in the gaps stand it up uh improve upon
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
it and and make it a a a national model
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh for kids and families with the
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
highest risk of at a home placement by
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
doing that we have a few major goals
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
reduce our Reliance on residential
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
placements maintain maintain a low
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
census at the
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
YDC redirect our funds from res from the
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
residential line to our community line
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
to strengthen to continue to strengthen
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
our community based system of care and
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
Achieve better outcomes for kids and
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
families particularly those that we've
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
marginalized pushed out sent out of
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
state or linger in in in Hamstead or the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
d uh the syc so it's really about uh
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
building upon our current system that
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
works great for 98% of the kids in our
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
state and I like to say that we're now
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
going to build a Continuum for the 2%
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
the few hundred kids that right now are
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
not on a track for Success then they
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
need some really robust interventions
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
and really robust supports for their
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
families their Foster families their kin
 
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.389 align:start position:0%
families their Foster families their kin
folks

00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh and themselves so Al on there and any
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and welcome um it was it
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
was a great honor for me to be able to
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
work with um director ripsom um for some
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
time when
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
startlingly all of the people who were
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
on the um child abuse fatality
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission came from health and Human
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
Services rather than children and family
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
law so I had to learn a lot very quickly
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I will also say that I am a casa and
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
work with children who are stuck in the
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
system because of abuse and neglect
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
issues and the one thing I'm sure it is
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
no news to you but the thing The Plea I
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to make is that um when we have
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
kids and families that are intact still
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
that are still with their parents and we
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
have found a counseling resource for
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
them my experience is they just begin to
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
trust a counselor and the counselor goes
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and you have to start
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
over again and these are kids and
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
families that are not programmed to
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
trust anybody easily so anything that we
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
can do to promote stability in the
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
system is a really good thing and I just
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
put that out there and as I say I know
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not telling you anything you don't
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
already know no that's uh thank you for
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
that and that's really what you just did
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
is hit on our main theme um a kid
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh who's been uh kicked out of
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
several residential placements in fora
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
homes said to his worker I have nobody I
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
have shift workers that come and go I've
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
been to you know a dozen agencies a
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
dozen forer homes I don't have anyone to
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
go to and that's exactly what we want to
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
do is develop a system of care where
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
every kid in need has a go-to person
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to be that as you
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
said um The Continuous person in their
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
life that they can trust they can
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
develop trust that could be their
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
Advocate could be their Mentor um their
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
broker of services and they're for them
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
when they most need them and I think all
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
of us in this room if we had any trouble
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
we were growing up they probably because
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
of where you're all sitting we probably
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
had someone that helped us along during
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
very tough times in our careers and in
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
our lives so that's it you get hit it
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
right on the head if we can develop
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
those kinds of systems there's one pilot
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
that we're now beginning which is a paid
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
mentorship program right now it's a
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
pilot so it's reserved for those kids
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the highest need those kids that
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
are uh lingering uh in our facilities um
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
don't have uh any connections we're
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to hire paid mentors from the
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
community where that kid
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
lives they can work 5 10 15 20 40 hours
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
a week face Toof face contact with their
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
young person and their caregiver uh to
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
really uh provide the robust services
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
that that kid needs until they're
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
stabilized then those hours can go down
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
and then they can uh go into more cruise
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
control until a crisis hits and then we
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
can Spike up those hours again so we're
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
reserving that now for the most uh the
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
highest need kids the ones most at risk
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
the kids that have nothing going for
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
them right this moment so again your
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
theme is perfect and and that's the
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
direction we'd love to head
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
Senator gray um this is part of
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
preaching to the choir uh but I am an
 
00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039 align:start position:0%
engineer I usually say I are an engineer
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
because we're not known for our English
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
but but you you get what you measure and
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the the only part that I would revise in
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
your statement is keep the number of
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
people at YDC down okay and what I want
 
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate people to have the
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
services of YDC if that number has to go
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
up because they need Services that's the
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
right thing it's not keeping the number
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
down that is the goal it's the right
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
Services which comes through in the rest
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
of your your speech but again I are an
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
engineer and I decided to say that thank
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
you yeah no got it yeah we want no kid
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
should be there doesn't need to be there
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
if there are other services in the
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
community so that's more the the way to
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
frame it so we want to build a frend
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
system programs to prevent kids from
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
going in that normally would have gone
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
in and on the back end a robust after
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
CARE program so they don't come back
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
right now 70% of the kids that go to YDC
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
come back within a year so we want to
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
change that number um and that's why uh
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
reduce our Reliance on the YDC but
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
you're correct kids that need to be
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
there we hope to have a great trauma
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
informed small facility to treat those
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
kids from the chair after the uh scandal
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
with the facility in Tennessee that um
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate Cassandra Sanchez
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
discovered um there was some quick
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
putting together rough
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh would you Deputy
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioner would you care to speak to
 
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
the the process of bringing this around
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
to a consensus yeah so um so thank you
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your leadership in in
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
convening us around um how to think in
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the in in a way that's both strategic
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally advances our common
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
agenda around what kids need and and the
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
need for for strong oversight use of
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
residential um only in the right cases
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh the Assurance of safety at
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
all times so what I can say is um as you
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
know we are finishing our review of your
 
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
um draft legislation um and thanks to
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
the way I think that you brought us
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
together there's a very
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary group engaged in that
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
um both across DHHS as I mentioned
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
really strong leadership from the
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health um DCF
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
but also working directly with the child
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
advocate um on the 98 again to use to
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
reuse the 98% metaphor you know really
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of things we agree on
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
and want to see um and then um
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your help shepherding that
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process so a lot
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
going on even in the last few days and
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
um and we're feeling feeling good about
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
and grateful for our involvement in that
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
the other Fellowship I hold is in child
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
welfare and what I discovered and when
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
our cohort last met was Most states have
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
a dcyf or the equivalent and an office
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
of child advocate and in many states
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
they are highly adversarial to each
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
other and my goal is that we will be
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
collaborative whenever possible and I
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
think it will be possible most of the
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
time and I wish to thank you folks at
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
dhh plus the office of child advocate
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
with agreeing with me on that and the
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
good news is with the deadlines we have
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that by the deadline we will be
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
able to have a revision to the bill is
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
submitted but if not when it lands
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere and it's either going to be
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
with you or with me next year um there
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
can be a chance for further tweaking so
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
I think we're on the road to something
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
good here and I want to thank your
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation very
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
much anyone else representative Edwards
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm assuming you don't have any
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
other remarks that you came ready to
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
okay so in that case I have uh just sort
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
of a setup for you um uh in fiscal
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee last week uh there was a
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
request that the department revisit Dr
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
Chen's uh letter uh relative to the
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
summary of coid
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
research and uh and the reason for the
 
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
research and uh and the reason for the
revisitation

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
revisitation
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
was that it was uh the response that we
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
got was extremely Broad and it it
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
basically was a boil the ocean kind of
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
thing and and because I think the
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
medical intelligence is suggesting that
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
Co is not gone and we're going to have
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with it again I would like us to
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
get in in get our front our best foot
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
forward and be prepared to answer the
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
question to parents of of whether or not
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
we can tell them that the clinical
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
research demonstrates that otherwise
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
healthy children under the age of 18 or
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
those who have had a natural immunity
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
are are good candidates for receiving
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
the coid um I I think um I you can tell
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
my bias in my question but I do think
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
that the DHHS should just have even if
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
do Chen all he did was saying yes I
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
think the science demonstrates that
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
children under the otherwise healthy
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 ought to
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
get the CO shot Ben Chen then that would
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
be fine I just want us on record so that
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
parents know what we're really telling
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
them yeah yeah thank you for that
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%

years I served on the staff of the

leadership team that I used to work with
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the sener and at times around other
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
staff to see what's going on so that I'm
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with what's happening I would
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
like to say that I think it's without a
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
doubt clear to everyone that the the
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal coid pandemic protective
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
emergency order that was came into place
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 was a very important
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
public relations of Public Health health
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
approach to dealing with this massive
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic and that came to an end one of
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
the actions that that order did was
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
protected the individuals who receiving
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
Services Under the Medicaid Program to
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
have the eligibility for Medicaid
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
protected throughout the period that the
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal order was in place so everyone
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
who at that time or came into the
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program during that protected
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
period had continuing coverage
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the protective order did
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
end on March 31st
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
2023 and now we're faced with a program
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that is now called Medicaid unwind how
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
do we take people who have been in this
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
protected status for an extended period
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
of time and ensure that they still have
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
the eligibility to receive those
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
benefits on a continuing basis and it
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
turned into being a rather uh Monumental
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
and overwhelming task which I think we
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
can comment on a little bit more when I
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
did meet with our people they had some
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that I felt I would like to at
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
least present to you but I Al like to
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
say that I also am aware that um um
 
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.270 align:start position:0%
say that I also am aware that um um
Medicaid

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
unwind um
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
is has left some people without benefits
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
for suspended period while that
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility is being redetermined one of
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
the end results of that has been that
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
some people being served at the middle
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
Health Center continue to be served but
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've lost Revenue in rather substantial
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
amounts uh averaging fair amount as I
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
indicated in in the memo and the
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
information that I have only comes from
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
the experience I glean from the staff at
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the mental health center but I'm very
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the other mental health
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
centers are experiencing many of the
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
same concerns and issues and have some
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the same suggestions I'd like to make
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
today to how to move this further along
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and there is an organization called
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Behavioral Health
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
Association made up of all 10 Community
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
M Health Centers and they are currently
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
Gathering Statewide data on this to to I
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
hope further support the issues that I
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
bring before you today uh one of the
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
issues of concerned is over the last 6
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
months since the protective order ended
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh the the federal order ended uh we've
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
lost a substantial amount of Revenue
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
averaging about $250,000 a month now
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
much of that Reven Vue once the
 
00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility is redetermined for all
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
those people are unaffected and have
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
their eligibility currently suspended
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
will return and once their elb
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
determined are also allowed to
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
retroactively Bill back to the Medicaid
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
Program to collect for the services that
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
we provided before however there is some
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
issue about what will happen with all
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
the people who for one reason or another
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
and there are lots of reasons why they
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
may not any longer have the same
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility that was protected under the
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
federal order that they will not and
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
under those people there is no
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
retroactive payment for the services
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
that would continue to be provided and
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess one of the reasons why I
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
brought it up was if there's any way to
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
help some of the mental health centers
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
deal with this lost Revenue that they
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
can't now regain the use of uh it would
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
be appreciated in one memo that I
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
thought and I don't want to go into
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
details about what it works but there
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
are certain patients two-thirds of the
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
people we serve in Manchester are
 
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.829 align:start position:0%
people we serve in Manchester are
considered

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
State eligible meaning that they served
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
under a contract that the mental health
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
centers have with a division of
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health at the Department of
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and that
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
requires that any individual who has one
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
of the categories of mental illness that
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
are approved for eligibility under this
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
state contract as long as the experience
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
if falls into one of those four state
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
categories that they're eligible to
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
receive a capitated grant issued through
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
the approved by the division of
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and issued through the
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh three Managed Care Organization
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
administer administer and dispense
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits and
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh there is another part to that which
 
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
is that there is a uh maintenance of
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
effort memorandum that that's out and
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
each month we have to look at the
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
capitated rate that's given to each
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
client and collectively look at did the
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
amount paid out to the mental health CS
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
under this capitated rate fall
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
significantly below looking at the the
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
whole program that it fall significantly
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
below what was expected the level of
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
service that they were supposed to
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
retain I know this sounds very
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
complicated when I try to explain it in
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
very simple terms but in in fact
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is a payback and one of
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
the things that we wondered is is there
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
any way that memorandum or M of effort
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh payback and and and adjustment can be
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
waved During the period of Medicaid
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
unwind as all these people get
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
reestablished with their Medicaid
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
Eligibility or find out that they're not
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
going to be any longer Medicaid eligible
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
I do understand I did forward the
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
remarks that I gave to you to the
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
director of the uh the uh Division of
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services at the Department of
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services And he as he
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
often does responded very quickly to me
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
about some of the comments that go into
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
more detail than I could possibly go I
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
just want you to understand that this
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
report which is a page and a half long
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
has to be a gross oversimplification of
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
the whole Medicaid unwind program I
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
think it summarizes what goes on but
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's a gross
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
oversimplification and I I do hope that
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
some of them uh that I think some of the
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
details that he outlined to me in his
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
response to my sending it to him would
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
be I should also say in terms of my work
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
with Henry Litman who is the director of
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services at the division in my
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
experience with him working with him on
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
several bills where I was a sponsor or
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor that pertained to Medicaid I
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
always found him to be a very competent
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
fair-minded administrator who was ready
 
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
to listen and always ready to consider
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
any new ideas and was always a reservoir
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
of information about technical issues
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to consider as we made
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
decisions about these issues
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
and to give us some feet in the ground
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
advice about how things might be handled
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
under difficult circumstances and I
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
think when he has his chance to come up
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
later in this uh meeting today he'll
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns that you
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
have and that'll be very hopeful and I
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
do understand that it's a possibility of
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
that memori understand that maintenance
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
of effort understanding may actually be
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
partially dealt with as I understood it
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
from his memo which I was not aware of
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
when I first wrote the memo however it
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
it would be split but I think the more
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
we can do to offset that loss of revenue
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
for the people that we can't
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
retroactively build for would be helped
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
second time would you wrap it up and
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
then we'd like to ask you some questions
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
will I will I will try to be as fast as
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
I can I would also like just want to
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
recognize the hard work and effort put
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
forth by all the agencies that are
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
involved including uh Mr litman's
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
division at the state level uh the the
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
local district offices the community M
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and the four manage three
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations that are
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
dispensing those benefits I do think
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
that however that uh communication is a
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
very vital part of making this whole
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
process work because the process itself
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
is being added on the ongoing work of
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
all these agencies in so in addition to
 
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
all their regular routine efforts they
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
added problem added on to how they how
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
do they go about resolving it it is a
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
over overwhelming it's times complex
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
very complicated process that can be
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
frustrating difficult and um stressful
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
for everybody involved which can lead to
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
problems in and of itself but I think
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we look for
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
ways to find all four of the elements to
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
work closely together I have made the
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
effort to make a few recommendations of
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
how communication might be facilitated
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
to do this so that the four parties
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
could work as closely together as
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
possible to make make this a reality and
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
I think under the leadership of the Mr
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
Litman and the others that I'm quite
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
confident myself that it's going to work
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be a long process I
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if I need to go through those
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
four steps I think they're fairly well
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
detailed in that report but here any
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
questions please feel free to ask would
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for The
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
Honorable gentleman uh representative
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and it's
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
really nice to see you back here in this
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
house The Honorable Mr
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
K snow this speaks a lot to the issue of
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
the mental health therapy that's
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
received by the patient if you will it
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
does not talk to I think once you go off
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid one of the cornerstones of
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
mental health therapy has been
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical care drug therapy and I
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
would clim to understand or maybe hear
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
from you or someone else when they go
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
off Medicaid what impact does it have
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
for them because they most likely don't
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
have access to the pharmacy for the
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
drugs they need so can you speak to that
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
impact as far as looking at
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical care what this is having
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
as far as the patient care I understand
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
why you're asking that question and that
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
is one of the biggest challenges when
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
people go off Medicaid and let's face it
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
even for people who are in that category
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
called Low utilizers that is people that
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
move fairly well into their process of
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
recovery and are doing well certain
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues have to be maintained
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
and often that's the maintenance of
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
medication that helps control the
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
various symptomss and issues that arise
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
out the result of their continuing
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness and that's a
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
real Challenge and I I can't go into
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
great detail about how we do it but we
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
always are looking for other ways to get
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
people insured under some of the other
 
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.510 align:start position:0%
people insured under some of the other
optional

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
optional
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical uh discount programs that
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
are involved we use free samples that
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
are given up by the drug companies
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
wherever we can to augment it we also
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
look at if there are any other
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that we could use
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to what we're going but it
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
is an enormous challenge that really
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
takes an awful lot of thought and effort
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
on the part of the people providing that
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
care uh and I I I would also say that
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
because we have that kind of contact
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
where we're doing a lot of problem
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
solving around how do I get my medicine
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
I'm being told I can't my rent is going
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
up I have to look for another place to
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
live can you help me try to locate that
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of this face-to-face
 
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:25.559 align:start position:0%
contact that takes place and of all the
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
partners that are involved the metal
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
health centers are the ones that have
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
the most face-to-face contact with all
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
these recipients we're often also in a
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
position to understand some of the
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
issues that could arise that could
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
affect in one way or the other what
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
their eligibility is and as long as we
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
can get take advantage of that
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
face-to-face contact to make sure that
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
information that we may have at our
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
disposal to pass it along would be very
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
useful and I think I detail that in my
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Edwards uh
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh it's it's good
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
seeing you again good to see you again
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
honorable Ken snow um okay so so you
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
you've always been smarter than I am in
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
this area and so I'm just I'm just going
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
to ask you to some make sure my summary
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
of what you're saying is is accurate and
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
if it is a yes is fine and if it's no
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
then maybe you could educate me offline
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
but um the what I think you're here
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
asking today is that these suggestions
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
on the second page that start with
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
periodic lists and lists provided and
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
all participants that that these are
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
really suggestions for the Department
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
that the department ought to be doing
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
that and that it sounds like your
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
request or your ask of the legislature
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
is to try to find a way to fill uh a gap
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
for those people who in the Medicaid
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
unwind who haven't been able to find
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
Alternative Insurance programs that are
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
now left naked in the in the insurance
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
area that we find a way to address that
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
Gap and I think are those kind of the
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
two summary points of what you're asking
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
today yes I I I would agree it is I just
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
if I could expand upon it just a little
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
bit I would say that one of the issues
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
is that I think the information is out
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
there they have attempted to give lists
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
but there was another group of people in
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the four agencies that are
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
also somewhat frustrated and and under a
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
great deal of stress as a result of this
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
and that is the actual recipients so
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the communication has to be
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
communicated in such a way that
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's kind of on the same page and
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I'm hoping is that we can
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
find ways to make sure that that
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
actually happens I think the division
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
does the very best they possibly can and
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
getting that information out as a timely
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
way as they possibly can but it's it
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
still becomes a problem I think to do
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
and if we can find any ways to expedite
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
that and see all the parties working
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
more closely together uh and you need to
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
understand that all four of these
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
agencies are all frankly under staff we
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
all have trouble recruiting an adequate
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
number of people to fulfill all our
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
ordinary routine responsibilities and to
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
add this Monumental task on top of it is
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
a real problem so they're all underst
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
staffed and under resources they try to
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
improve communication and communication
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a timec consumer
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
often frustrating and very stressful
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
situation that leaves everybody kind of
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
upset and canly the finger pointing it
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
you know you don't want to say that
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
things are moving slowly because of
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
something I'm doing but it's always easy
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
to something what somebody else is doing
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
and I think communication and
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate and well understood
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
communication is the best way to offset
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
could um I could be wrong about this uh
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
or and you just mentioned the
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
communication aspect of things but was
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is unwind was pending
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh as the March 31st deadline was
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
approaching notices went out encouraging
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
redetermination and
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
reapplication um and that's why I'm
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
wondering what if that uh was a lack of
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
communication or what contributed to
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
this backlog and delay in
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
redetermination can you speak to that
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of reasons and I
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's no way I can give you a brief
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
answer to that the people who had their
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility their needs were
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
communicated directly by the division to
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals you need to know who the
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
individual we are all dealing with
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
they're all individuals who know very
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
well that we're obligated to continue to
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
provide services to them whether or not
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
we have a resource to pay for those
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
services or not so a lot of times even
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
though the communication is sent
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
directly to them they get very stressed
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness I'm going to lose contact
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
with them so the letter often doesn't
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
really get transported to other people
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that they're working with face to face
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it falls apart at that
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
level I think I I can't really find any
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
fault with how they do if you read some
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
of the letters that go out they're very
 
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.349 align:start position:0%
of the letters that go out they're very
fact-based

00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
fact-based
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
but for people who are consumers and
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
even people who are approaching this
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
kind of problem with a different
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
perspective like the practitioners out
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the field sometimes those fact-based
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
letters are a little hard to interpret
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
so that's why I just stressed if we
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
could get all the parties working more
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
closely together and seeing it as a
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative as opposed to you do your
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
job and and I'll do M and eliminate the
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of that finger pointing that
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
I saw as the biggest dilemma that we
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
have to face and I don't hold anyone at
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
fault and I for doing it because I think
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
everybody to some extent is bound to do
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
it when they're under this much
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
stress any other questions did I did I
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative uh
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
once in we hope future yes I I hope so
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
too I really miss being up here it uh it
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
was very much uh doing I i' would also
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
like to thank uh representative Edwards
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
who was extremely helpful to me in two
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid bills that I work he
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time working with us and
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
I think the kind of communication we had
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I found him a real asset to us in
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
trying to move those forward and I thank
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
do chair recognizes um Henry Litman uh
 
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
do chair recognizes um Henry Litman uh
Medicaid

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning um for the record
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
Henry Lipman the state's Medicaid
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
director um so I I think what I'm about
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
to walk through will sort of compliment
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit what uh The Honorable
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative snow uh um presented to
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
you I hope to um share a little bit more
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
perspective what we have done um to
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
protect um people but I guess first of
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
all our goal in in stretching the unwind
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that anybody who is
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid um does not lose
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
it um and those that that can't be
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid that we look to
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
try to help them find other sources of
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
coverage this effort actually um started
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
in July of 2020 um and we've been
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
communicating um to
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries um over a three-year
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
period before we
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
began um understanding that at some
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
point that continuous coverage was going
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
to end um we started off with a pink
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
letter Campaign which was you know to
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
kind of address what um The Honorable
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
representative snow um referred to some
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
of the communication challenges we knew
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
that um it would be beneficial not to
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
stop our work during the unwind and if
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
people would voluntarily do their
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
redetermination ahead of time um we'd
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
have more capacity to be responsive to
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
their their needs and um close to 30,000
 
00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
people took advantage of that um about
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
10 just under 104,000 did not um but it
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
it fairly remarkable to get people to do
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
something when they didn't need to um so
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
we started off with a pink letter
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
campaign um and um multiple events uh
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
you know some having as many as 300
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
people on conference calls sort of
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
briefing them about what was going to
 
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.430 align:start position:0%
briefing them about what was going to
happen

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
we also created incentives in our
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
Managed Care contract for the mcos to do
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach um that continue to the stay in
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
terms of um reaching their um
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
individuals and what we actually did is
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
provided um list to the mcos of the
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
people who were coming up for
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
redetermination what they were missing
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
um to become eligible we also provided
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
um for this hund roughly 104,000 list to
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
mental Health Centers federally
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers of their people
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
who were in that protected status um and
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
we would update that every month um for
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
them and with the idea that it's really
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh going to take a community effort to
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
to try to help some some people so then
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
we finally get to the point where um you
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
know Congress took action to create a
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
definitive end to it we created a yellow
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
Campaign which was sort of a um a way
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
Telegraph to to individuals as well as
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
people might be trying to help them that
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
um something that is sort of the caution
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
color pink if you will be a friendly
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
color yellow be a caution color you know
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
actually what we had developed there
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
actually became something that was
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
adopted nationally by many states in
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
terms of just a way to rather than the
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
typical white paper um if you will very
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
technical things that are required by
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
law in terms of noticing
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
um we also then in terms of structuring
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the N
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
wine um did what we called a risk-based
 
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
approach which was to to the best of our
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
ability based on information we had um
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
have the individuals that were most
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
likely not to keep coverage be earlier
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the unwine and those that were more
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
at risk to be later in the unwine um and
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
I think maybe um you know I think that
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
probably no state in the country did
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
more in terms of Outreach to to
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
individuals despite that there's still
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who didn't respond I think
 
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's I I'll try to get to
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh Snow's um uh
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations at the end of terms I
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
think what more can be
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
done well while you're taking a breath I
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
will repeat that you're a groupy to uh
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid uh directors around the
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
country I know because that came up in
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
one of my fellowships and somebody said
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
oh New Hampshire Henry Litman I said you
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean the Henry Litman and they said yeah
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
so continue thank you um just to kind of
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
give you a snapshot where we're at the
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
third uh slide and um kind of gives you
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
a high level view of where we are as of
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
this past
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
Monday um you know New Hampshire's um
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
total enrollment grew to
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
21,35 that's the number on the top right
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
of that slide um and you can see if you
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
look uh to your left the granted
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program Medicaid expansion
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
grew to almost 97,000 individuals at its
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
peak in March um we had typically been
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
running in the low 50,000 uh um so in
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
terms of looking at where we are today
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
in granted Advantage we're we're almost
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
for you know just under 39,000 less
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
individuals in the
 
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.549 align:start position:0%
individuals in the
program

01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of that program that
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's largely an income based program
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
so that um you know if you look at why a
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
lot of people qualified there the shock
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the the some of the closures or
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
partial closures in the system led to a
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
lot of people being unemployed for a
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
short period of time and there was an
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to gain health coverage
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
where you may have lost it through your
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
employer um and then for you know just
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
basically three years we we didn't go
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
through the normal annual process of
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
checking people's eligibility we are now
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
required to do so
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
and um you know that drop and enrollment
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
in that group isn't I think totally be
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
unexpected some of those individuals
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
could be um folks that were in the
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center uh system
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
but if they're income ineligible there's
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
not much that we can do directly what we
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
did do though however is um for IND we
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
were um the first and only state so far
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
in the country that developed a a pilot
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
program with um ciia which is the agency
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
that oversees the the exchanges and we
 
01:03:01.799 --> 01:03:02.589 align:start position:0%
that oversees the the exchanges and we
actually

01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
transferred um about a little over
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
20,000 uh maybe close to 24,000
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
individuals uh to The Exchange about
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
half of those would have otherwise gone
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere under the old system where um so
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they had the chance to not only
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
have communication from us but
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
communication from the New Hampshire
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
Navigators and federal government to
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
make them aware of the opportunity to
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
get coverage um you know federally um we
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
also you know in the whole effort um
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
made phone calls to every every
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
household um and the ones with the most
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable more than once um during this
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
effort to alert them um and and despite
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
that there there are people who probably
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
may still be eligible that that are but
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things I highlighted in
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
conversation with former representative
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
snow is that um New Hampshire adopted
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
one of the federal flexibilities
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
ordinarily someone um has 90 days to ask
 
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.390 align:start position:0%
ordinarily someone um has 90 days to ask
for

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
reconsideration um the federal
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
government offers 120 days for States
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
during this unwind period we adopted
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
that so someone may have lost
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
coverage um if it's less than 120 days
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
out they actually can get retroactive
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
coverage to be put on Medicaid that's
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that one of
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
the efforts that can be made at this
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
point is that probably most of the
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
higher risk people are more currently
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
have lost coverage um and there's an
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to bring them back on um
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
I think that everybody could redouble
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
their efforts um in that regard the
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
other thing we've done is every month um
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
we started this in June which is just
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
two months into it when we saw people
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
who had high Medical utilization or risk
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
we um the Medicaid administrative team
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
made additional phone calls to these
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
people to see what they whether they
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
knew that they got the paperwork whether
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
they were in process um we've made
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
almost 2,000 calls of that type and
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
we've reached over 700 people um to
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
speak to them um you know on top of what
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing um in terms of all the
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
notifications um but I do think that
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're right in the period now where it's
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
really important that you know there's
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
still a Lifeboat out there and um we
 
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
ought to try to be working um you know
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
as collaboratively can with both the
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
mcos and the uh cmhc's and others just
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
think what you could accomplish if you
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
had an adequate staff in terms of
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
numbers huh well um you know I think
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
that um everybody's pitched in more and
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
and you know people worked um you know I
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
think uh representative Edwards asked me
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
the question you know can we sustain the
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
effort through the through the unwind
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know a few months ago and I we you
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
know people have stepped up to to work
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
extra where we've had vacancies to to
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get done what we need
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
to get done um this slide four in the
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
deck is really um a summary of how we
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
sort of structured who went first in
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
this effort
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
um uh slide uh five I think gets to kind
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
of the the concept that I'm trying to
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
suggest is real where the opportunity
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
lies today that what we've seen and when
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
we report statistics we're reporting
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
them on in the current month um for the
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
month that they're due but what we're
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
also tracking is whether they reopen
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
later and so um there's three statistics
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
here I won't read it read them all to
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
you but um there are people here um that
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
are able to come back on um and when you
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
consider the various categories the
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
percentage is actually fairly um you
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
know high and worthwhile to to go
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
after uh in addition um and the next
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
slide excuse me yeah which is slide six
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
is we um during the process of reaching
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
out and calling people we also had um
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
almost um 6% of the individuals or 7% of
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
the closures actually were people who
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
told us when we reached out to them do
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
you still need Medicaid um told us they
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
didn't you know they found other sources
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
of coverage some people you know there
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
were some reported deaths in the
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
population um but you know we did um
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
this work I think again is unique I've
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
been other states have reached out to me
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
um Missouri I think it is most recently
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
about how we did this um and it was a
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
combined effort of the department and
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
the mcos in that
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
regard um slide seven is kind of what's
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
what's our statistics that are reported
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
federally um and what we keep separately
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
um Orient you a little bit to this chart
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
I think there are really three sections
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the column that's titled grand total
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
is what are the public facing statistics
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
that CMS will ultimately report on the
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
month we divide it between what we call
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
the protected population and the
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
nonprotected population as I mentioned
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
before the protected population was
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
about 100 104 just under 104,000 people
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
the balance are what we call
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
nonprotected meaning that they were
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
never subject to that that that coid
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
situation in terms of having continuous
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
coverage they're going through an annual
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
process and renewal process and the the
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
slide on that I have up first here on
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
slide seven is the month of September
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
what we've seen over time is that based
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
on our structuring of the unwine that as
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
we expected to go further into it the
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
people who we were trying to protect the
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
most were like more likely to keep
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
coverage and that's exactly what we're
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in the statistics in both the
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
protected and the nonprotected uh
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
categories if you look at sort of the
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
flesh tone um part there that
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the month of September that you
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
know 79% overall retain
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
coverage and that's broken down in
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
between the protected group the people
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
that had the coid
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
protections and the nonprotected group
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
which are people coming through their
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
routine um that next
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
section is the um the area where um the
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh nonprocedural
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah the procedural folks are the
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
ones that are with that special pilot
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
which would have otherwise dead lettered
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
meaning nothing would have happened to
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
them um and so those have been referred
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal government for further
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
work and work by our local Navigators
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then um an additional level of
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
detail that we provide um down the
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
bottom which isn't federally disclosed
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
but we've been looking at is what were
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
the reasons for the closures you know
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
was it income was it that they failed to
 
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.390 align:start position:0%
was it income was it that they failed to
to

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
redetermined at this point to to uh to
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
complete their
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
redetermination um the next slide down
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
to eight is sort of the cumulative
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
effort um
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
and here again I think that earlier on
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
in the campaign if you will um
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
individuals loss coverage were more due
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
to income that those were the people
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
that we had a good indication or were
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
over income based on information we had
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm getting the move it along um
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
then the next slide um is uh what we've
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
done to
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh make it easier on people um and terms
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
of when we have enough information to
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
determine their eligibility without them
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
submitting additional information um
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
we've made adjustments in policy both
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
what CMS allows and what basically how
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
we structured the population which has
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
led to the more recent months where the
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable people are that we've
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
been more often been able to um do a
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
review without them even requiring their
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork in in the upcoming month of
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
November it will be 74% of the
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
population will be renewed without
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
having to go through the torturous
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
process of completing the
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
application um slide 10 is just a kind
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
of where we're at we're about 97%
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
through the unwind as of of today we're
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
but we're really slowing down a lot now
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
because we got the and extended the
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
period all the way out to to May for the
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
in it's small numbers but it's the
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
really most vulnerable people um you
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
know people at are home and based uh and
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and such that they we
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
really see that they need more help than
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
than some of the people earlier um and
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
then um the last slide I have is just
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
some a summary of a sort of our call
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
campaign that extra effort we make when
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
we see each month the people that uh um
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
have medical conditions showing up in
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
claims that suggest that they need some
 
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.070 align:start position:0%
claims that suggest that they need some
additional

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
Outreach so I guess to to make a longer
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
story short um we're certainly open to
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
working with the Community Mental Health
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
Centers further um I think it's not
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
something the department can control
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's something that everybody's got to
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
make their best contribution to it the
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
mcos the um you know when people come in
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know um if they have a um authorized
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
rep relationship with them they can do a
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
lot to see what's going on um the mcos
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
even one of the mcos has developed a
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
lookup file where people can check um
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
their members uh we
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're in the process now with
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
regular renewals we it's a dynamic
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
changing group of populations so we
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
can't produce the same kind of reports
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
we could when it was a static
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
population will you take questions
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
please sure and last thing on the
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort if I could uh is
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
that there is in our contract currently
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
with the mcos a a 50% disregard if um
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
they don't make the the the number of
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
visits and such that they should um
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
under their contracts um which we've had
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
in place for quite a bit of this
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
contract and we're evolving the contract
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
and the reprocurement um to a very
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
different system um that will be helpful
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
to the m to the Community Mental Health
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
Centers chair recognizes representative
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chair uh fir first
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Litman I I just want to um take the
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
chance to uh congratulate you and your
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
team again on outstanding implementation
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
of the new Medicaid rates reimbursement
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
rates um it it turned out to be a far
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
more complex project than what we had
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
assumed in the legislature and you guys
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
brought in your actuaries and did all
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
the community outreach and it was just
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's the only thing I've ever gotten
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
somebody from the community to call me
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
and tell me how great it was so normally
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
people call me to complain but that was
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
great um a a small thing
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
as I look at page and you don't have to
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
address this but just to let you know as
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh page seven under um
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
total closure by reasons I look at
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
failed to uh
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
redetermined the graph presentation of
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
that on slide 10 bottom left hand it it
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
looks like the data is different and the
 
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
graph doesn't present as I would have
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
expected yeah so I just would say if
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is public facing you may want to
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
have somebody just double check that
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I and I'm I'm confident the numbers
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a different kind of look
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
that the the stuff that's in the table
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
is sort of a um what's done and what you
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
see in um the the bar chart is sort of
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
forward looking we're looking at October
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
and November um uh okay so that's a
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
future State yep okay um and then my may
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
I and then my favorite question to you
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
now that we're sort of so far along in
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
terms of um having the Medicaid contract
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
renewed uh are are you uh confident that
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to have at least three mcos
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and I know you're
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
limited to what you can say because it's
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
proprietary but if you could just kind
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
of indicate whether you think uh we're
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
at risk well I think one of the
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions you've asked me in the past is
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know what is going to be the
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment um figure that because you
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
need about 50 60,000 per MCO to make it
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
worth a while to be in the market in
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to compete um I
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
think that you know right now we're at
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit above where we were
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
um last time we went out for procurement
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
there are several policies that are in
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
hp2 that we're in the process of
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
implementing which will have some effect
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
of marginally increasing enrollment that
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
was the postpartum coverage uh that went
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
into effect um 101 uh effective January
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
1 is the for the legally residing
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and children but probably
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
the larger one is a federal requirement
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
that um all states have to adopt which
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
is children have to have 18 and under
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to have 12 months of continuous
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
coverage and so um that I think will
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
have an effect of making the market just
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit more attractive I I do
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
think that will have three um mcos
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
through we have all through uh Amendment
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
um excuse me the what I'll call contract
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
number two the fiveyear period that ends
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh this August and I I suspect that
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to to have
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again great work on on the
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you Mr
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
Litman look forward to your occasional
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
updates happy to do so and I think uh Dr
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
finny's here to do a little bit on the
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
checkup on our dental program something
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
we will get our teeth
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
mouth um we went 10 minutes without a
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
dad joke what do you mean okay yes hi
 
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
dad joke what do you mean okay yes hi
good

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
morning um Dr Sarah finny Medicaid
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
dental director um thank you very much
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to have some time this
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
morning to bring you up to date on the
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
adult Dental benefit um I believe you
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
handout um I want to start off with
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
really the most important thing and that
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
is um how many of our members are
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
getting Services because that's what
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
this whole thing is really all about and
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to say that between April 1
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
which was our implementation date and
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
now we have had over 8,000 unique
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
members served um through the denal
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
program and uh the vast majority of
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
those have had more than one appointment
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
but this is one of the things that we
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
track um to really see how things are
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
going um in these early days of the
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
program so so Dr Finny just so I
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
understand the graph this is this is
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
each month this is not cumulative um the
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
graph is is each month and 8,000 is the
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
cumulative number of unique patients
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
overall um you'll see that there's a a
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
steady increase in the number of members
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
as well as claims with a slight dip in
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
July which is very normal um I've seen
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
that with my experience and the
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
children's benefit um you know providers
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
and members are alike are not at work
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
and at home um and that's to be expected
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a little bit of a claims
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
lag usually two to three months so
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
September um when we pulled these
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
numbers we we know that we still
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
probably don't have all of the September
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
claims so when I report to you again um
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
that will show
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
the correct amount and I I do believe
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we are seeing steady growth month
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
over month and the preliminary uh
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
numbers that I have for October show
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
that um to be true I think it's
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
important um to point out at this point
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
that both Northeast Delta and deltaquest
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
are engaging with providers to make sure
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
that um they understand how the claims
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
process is working in this program and
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
they are training providers and their
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
office staff so that claims processing
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
goes through um
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and they're also reaching
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
out to support members to as an an
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
effort in recruitment to show that they
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
really are dedicated to making sure that
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
there is minimal administrative burden
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
providers and then one little um piece
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
of information that I wanted to share
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
because I think it it is a concern that
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
we all had going into this out of of the
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
39 oral surgeons that are practicing in
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 20 are enrolled in this
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
benefit and that speaks to the
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts that have gone on
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm very happy with that and
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
recruiting is still going on that that
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
has not stopped it will not stop and um
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
program um that leads nicely into the
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
next page which is the actual Network um
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
dashboard so we have 142 unique members
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
at 103 unique locations as I said 20 of
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
those were oral surgeons and that is at
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
20 different
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
locations um we also are taking
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of some providers along our
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
borders who do have experience um in the
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
past um they have treated our Medicaid
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
adults um when they just had the
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
emergency benefit and you know uh we
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
have added them to the the network
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
because that's an important piece for
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
some of our residents who are at the
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
border and that may actually be the most
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
um convenient location for them we also
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
do provide a breakdown um there are 10
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
providers who are take five which means
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
that they've agreed to take on five
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
members see how it goes and um you know
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
the idea is that with the support that
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
Quest is providing uh for
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
administration uh that that will lead to
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
them actually seeing more members 57 are
 
01:22:31.719 --> 01:22:32.629 align:start position:0%
them actually seeing more members 57 are
off

01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
directory uh and 41 member um providers
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
are seeing their existing patients which
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
means they had adults that were in their
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
practices who were Medicaid eligible um
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
and they are maintaining them in the
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
practice and and treating them now under
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
the new benefit and then um currently 11
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
are treating special needs patients only
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the far right is the breakdown by
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
County um and I I will say that
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts are driven by our
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
priority area needs so as new dentists
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
enroll and drop into that breakdown it
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
will change the emphasis on on what
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
areas um are more active in
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
recruitment so there's a lot of of
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
movement um it's all positive movement
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
and we are adjusting as we go um I do
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
want you to know that our frequency of
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
meetings with North East Delta and denta
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
Quest has not slowed down from our
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
implementation practice I am not
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
exaggerating when I tell you I have at
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
least one meeting a day that involves
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
something to do with the adult program
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
because we are focused on making sure
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
that it is functioning the way that it
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
was meant
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
to um the next page um goes into our
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
mobile dental clinics which is another
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
critical piece of the network we realize
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
that there are certain areas of the
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
state where we may never have the bricks
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
and mortar dental offices to really take
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
care of our members and so we're using
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
mobile services to fit into the network
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
so that we're getting services to those
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
areas um this schedule changes um this
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
schedule looks slightly different than
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
it did last week and part of that was
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
based on demand um I'm happy to say that
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh this weekend Saturday and Sunday the
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
mobile van will be in lonia at Health
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
First and they have a very robust
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
schedule on Saturday there will be two
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
dentists working there and they have 20
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
patients scheduled and on Sunday there
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
will be one dentist there and they have
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
12 patient scheduled um and that's what
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're aiming for when the van goes out
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
to a site we want to make sure that that
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
chairs are filled and that time is being
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
used efficiently to best serve um our
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
members in those areas and the mobile
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
services are not oneandone uh they are
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
definitely planned um with a certain
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
frequency we want to make sure that
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
those services are are available on an
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis and so you'll see um as
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
the schedule develops that we do go back
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the same locations month month after
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
month and that is to make sure that not
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
only are Urgent needs taken care of but
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
those members are getting ongoing
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
services that they
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
need and then the last um part of the
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
program that I think is also very
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
important is uh stakeholder engagement
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
with various organizations and agencies
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
across the state Northeast Delta and
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
denta Quest have taken very seriously um
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
um their the importance of them being
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
involved with outside organizations to
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
really get at what our members needs are
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
how do we best serve them how do we
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
support the dental providers and the
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
network so that they can serve members
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
effectively and to that end um there are
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
there are items that um specify really
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
for dentists including oral surgeons and
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier there is uh
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
one-on-one recruitment Outreach still
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing across the state um the team
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
from Den Quest and and Delta is involved
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
in different conferences and educational
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are going on
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
regarding oral health across the state
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most um helpful
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
things that they have done the team goes
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
out to the New Hampshire Dental Society
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
component meetings every fall the latest
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
um president of the dental Society goes
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
out and meets at each of the nine
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
components and that is a perfect um
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet dentists in a a
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
small setting it allows for
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
conversations and um I would say that um
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
that has been an important part of
 
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
recruitment is getting the word out um
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
not only from uh the side of Northeast
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
Delta and den Quest but also to speak to
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
dentists that are already providers and
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
can speak to how things are going and
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully encourage other dentists to
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
enroll as well um and the team is also
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
involved with the New Hampshire oral
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
health Coalition and all of the things
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
that they are working on so they're
 
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
really trying to connect at many
 
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.550 align:start position:0%
really trying to connect at many
different

01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
levels um the team also is meeting with
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities we have bimonthly
 
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
meetings with the nursing home
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
Association which allows for a back and
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
forth conversation we get real- time
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
information about how things are working
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
possibly where we need to make some
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments and making sure that we
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand the needs of our residents
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
who are in nursing facilities because
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
their needs are definitely going to be
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
different than a lot of our other
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
members um and that conversation
 
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
includes working with the transportation
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
vendor because we know that that's an
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
important piece of um the benefit
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
there and then lastly the the special
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
needs population um is one that we're
 
01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
really trying to make sure that we have
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
not only the Prov ERS available that
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable and ready to treat
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
those members but also to give them
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
support training continuing education
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
that will allow them to continue to do
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
so and again also to introduce other
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
dentists who may not have considered um
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they were ready or able uh to treat
 
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.030 align:start position:0%
that they were ready or able uh to treat
that

01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
population AEL New Hampshire started up
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
an oral health task force within the
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
last several months and um our team
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
attends those meetings that has been a
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful place to really talk with
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
individuals that have special needs and
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
learn about what their past experiences
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
have been um attending Dental
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
appointments and what are the things
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
that really make or break that
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
relationship for them and we can learn a
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
lot from that group we also work with
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
area agencies uh we're working with the
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
UNH Institute on disability they
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
actually have a training module for um
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
um medical professionals to work with
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
special needs individuals they have act
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're very excited um about the adult
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
benefit and they would like to actually
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
try to do a second version of that
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
training module that is very specific
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
for dentists and so we're working with
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
them to develop that that will be
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
something um that can be done um online
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
at the convenience of providers um and
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
is meant to really be supportive and to
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
lead to um an increased uh enrollment
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
with these dentists and then um we're in
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
the early stages of discussion with an
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
organization called special Smiles which
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually originates out of New Jersey um
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
they have a whole program um that
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're very versed in treating special
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
needs individuals who need anesthesia
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so again it's just another um
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
organization that can help us to learn
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
what it is that we need to provide um
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
what what supports are out there so
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're not recreating the wheel here in
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if there are programs that
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
we can um gain information from you know
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do that um and I will
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions any questions
 
01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.709 align:start position:0%
take any questions any questions
representative

01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair thank you Dr
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
VY for taking my question um one of the
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
things talked about before is the issue
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
of Nosh shows and what impact it will
 
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
have on providers and my understanding
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
is that a no-show is not being
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
compensated by the program so are we
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
tracking or somehow tracking Nosh shows
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're not having a
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
situation where the providers are not
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
getting compensated because once they
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
book the time they can't rebook it very
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
good question and uh yes we are
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that there are codes um there
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
are dental um codes that track that and
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh what Dent Quest is doing uh is
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring when those codes come in and
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
they go to see who the member is that's
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
involved and there is Outreach directly
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the member to get out what the reason
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
is um that they were unable to make
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
their appointment and this plays in with
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
why we in felt it was so important to
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
include Care Management in this plan and
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
also the
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
transportation Mr
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
chair follow uh follow up thank you sir
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
is it possible to get a chart of how
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's going over time is it increasing
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
decreasing remaining stable is a way to
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
get some sort of documentation data I
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
can certainly get that information if if
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
I could just tag on to that comment uh
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
tag that that was uh that was one of the
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions I was going to ask U but uh if
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
you if you're going to provide us that
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
graph it might be useful to be able uh
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
if you're able to Benchmark against like
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
the commercial or the private pay no
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
show rate because I think the extent to
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
which our program has a higher or lower
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
no-show rate than private pay that that
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
is a a significant red flag if we've got
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
a a problem to to address so okay uh and
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
then uh I follow up I I I I want to tell
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
you that uh the way you're managing this
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
program is U far more complex and is
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
greater than what representative Shapiro
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I imagined when we first started you
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
know bouncing this around so I want to
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the maturity and
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
development of this program it's great
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm looking at slide three under
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
the county breakdown on the network
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
dashboard yes and there's a pre-f
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
flating arrow there I don't know if that
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
arrow is meant to indicate that bellnap
 
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
is a concern no as as I look at it uh I
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like Sullivan is a
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
concern my apology is that Arrow it was
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
meant to connect the total unique
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
providers and locations like look over
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
here this is the county breakdown and it
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
should not have been aimed at it should
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
have been aimed at okay no no SWAT but
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
um but so then my real question there is
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
um under this management by exception
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
principle if if you think Sullivan
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
County for example is the county that we
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
should be focused on and worried about
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
and everyone else is okay it would be
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
good to know where where your where your
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
big red flags are in the state um I
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
would say that Sullivan right now is
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
probably um the biggest concern and we
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of Outreach
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
going on to
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
determine you know where are the folks
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
really residing how far are they having
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
to go because there are several Prov you
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
know two providers there um so that is
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
an area of concern and that's why that
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
has now been added into the schedule for
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
the mobile services because we realize
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
we need to do something right now um
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
while we're continuing to recruit more
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
providers thank
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and my apologies for
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
coming in late um I just had one quick
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
question on the provider on the county
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
breakdown um I see that chesher county
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
is in there twice once once with five
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
and once with three and I'm
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
wondering why chesher is there twice one
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
with five and one with three and I I
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
assumed maybe it meant that people were
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
going out of state to Vermont but I see
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
that that's broken out separately I will
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
ask these number this was provided by D
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
Quest I will ask them about that and my
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
apologies for not C and just my personal
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
curiosity because that's my County thank
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
you before you leave I um made the de
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled Community one
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
of my interests when I first ran for the
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
house uh 7 and a half years ago and I
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
just want to say that the feedback I get

morning because of some other groups

morning thank you
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes looking at the calendar again in
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
December it looks like I am about to say
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
that there is some question as to
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
whether we should meet um in December if
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
we did it would be the 15th at 100 p.m.
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
and given the number of items that need
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be presented to us I would be in
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
favor of meeting in December and if you
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
wish privately to email me and let me
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
know what you think um if I have two
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
lists and one says five and the other
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
says three I will conclude that's eight
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
like jeser County uh Mr chair yes I just
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
want to let you know if my ankle is

the 10e mental health plan as you can
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
see from the report a lot of progress
 
01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
has been made uh since the report was
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
published in 2019 this morning we just
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
want to go through a few of the
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
highlights um in the report from the
 
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.109 align:start position:0%
highlights um in the report from the
last

01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:23.390 align:start position:0%
last
year

01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
so we'll start in the area um of in
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the goal for expanded
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
coordination of our Continuum of Care
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
and we really want to highlight the
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
progress that's been made through the
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
state's New Hampshire rapid response
 
01:38:35.199 --> 01:38:36.270 align:start position:0%
state's New Hampshire rapid response
crisis

01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
system as you're all aware we've created
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
a centralized crisis contact center that
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
within the last year and a half it's
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
responded to over 40,000 calls and
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
deployed mobile crisis response teams
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
over 9,000 times to respond to children
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
youth amilies and adults in the
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
need um since June of 20122 we've also
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
expanded critical time intervention to
 
01:39:05.709 --> 01:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
be a Statewide service and that program
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
is an evidence-based practice that
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
supports adults through transitions of
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
care and for many of the adults serve
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
through this program they're hitting the
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
mental health system or experiencing the
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
mental health system for the first time
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
and this program really helps to provide
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
um targeted concentrated support to help
 
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
that transition from the hospital from a
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility back into
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
the community to be better coordinated
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and more integrated um to help their
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
success in the
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
community another area we want to
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
highlight is in the area of prevention
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
and early intervention so I'll turn that
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
over to
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
Rebecca thank you Julian good morning um
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
we did want to highlight that we have
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
been able to expand our Care Management
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
entity Services through the Early
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
Childhood wraparound services is similar
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
to fast forward but this service focuses
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
on um the birth to five population as
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
well as the caregiver needs and while we
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
launched it with our um first Services
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
last July this July 1 we were able to
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
receive Medicaid approval um for it to
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
be a covered benefit through Medicaid um
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
and really Innovative in that it is
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
based on um needs and caregiver needs in
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
order to prevent or address Aces before
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're deeper in the system and we're the
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
first state to have had CMS approval for
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
that type of Medicaid benefit that is
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
very much prevention focused on Early
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
Childhood so that 10 years from now
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're not having the same conversations
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
system and lastly we wanted wanted to
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
recognize um the work taking place to
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
address Workforce challenges um just
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing the need to proactively
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
build uh our Workforce capacity the
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
department has been working on several
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives to create new career
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Pathways into the mental health system
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
so for example we worked in partnership
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
with our community mental health centers
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and New England College to create a new
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
Bachelor level uh Cooperative learning
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
program where students are able to
 
01:41:23.070 --> 01:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
enroll in the class as well as work for
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Center under
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
supervision and provide services uh to
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
their local community we've also been
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
working in partnership with the college
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
system to create new certification
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
programs one is for our peer certified
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
Specialists and the second is for
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
specialty crisis responder certification
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
program and both of those certification
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
programs we anticipate rolling out
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
through the Community College network in
 
01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.510 align:start position:0%
through the Community College network in
early

01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
2024 so you know in addition to to to
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
new career um Pathways new career
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
programs a lot of effort and funding has
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
been invested in training for our
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
current Workforce both to increase their
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
competencies and specialized services in
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
in an effort to cross train staff as
 
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
well as to have a focus on improving job
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and retention within our
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
community mental health
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
centers so that's a very high level
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
overview I mean as you can see from the
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
report a lot of progress has been made
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
um and as we look forward to 2024 the
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
department continues to be focused on
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
these priorities and goals within the
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
tenure Mental Health Plan um that are
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
outlined in the in the cover letter so
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're open to questions as you have them
 
01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.390 align:start position:0%
we're open to questions as you have them
anyone

01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
anyone representative Edwards we have to
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
question because I can't help
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
myself okay so this is all a very
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
positive thing you've told us right and
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
and today's theme for me is management
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
by exception so is there something going
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
on that we should know about that you're
 
01:42:59.470 --> 01:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
you're just a little concerned about in
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the development of the 10-year
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
plan or I mean you're very positive
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
there's got to be something broken
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere that's why you know we have
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the plan before us I I think what's
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
positive is that we have a clear
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
strategy the challenges are are
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely embedded in this cover letter
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of this is why we are focusing
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
on these areas there are concerns around
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
access to care that really is rooted in
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
the availability of of Workforce those
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
are the significant challenges that
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in our system is um being
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
able to find and retain enough workers
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
to provide the services that have been
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
invested in and stood up around the
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
state for example you've heard us say
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
before that the mobile crisis system is
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
staffed at about 50% capacity and other
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
programs are seeing similar Staffing
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
patterns thank you and thank you for
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%

Alzheimer's disease we also hope to
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
um develop and utilize a different
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
differentiated campaigns that look at

accomplish and uh in intend to uh look
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
at different models of being able to
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
look at the the reach that we have
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's um through uh multimedia
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
uh platforms as well as um accessible
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%

individuals um and another important
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
part of this plan is the reporting and
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%

budget and learning from this as well as
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the number of individuals who
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be reached um through this
 
01:51:36.069 --> 01:51:36.079 align:start position:0%

01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
operating in a number of different ways
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%

specifically what you're thinking about
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
and I realize that will depend to some
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
extent on what you and a a contractor
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%

precise methods of
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
communication thank you for the question
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%

Outreach and media Camp public awareness
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
campaign activities um that we would
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
like to see with the funding that we
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
have um appropriated for this project
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
project as part of the request for
 
01:54:25.229 --> 01:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
proposal we will be asking the vendor to
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
propose um a budget as well as
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of being able to meet the
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
goals of Statewide activity and reaching
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
all of the different audiences that we
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
have um coming up with a plan that will
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
include both I Envision um TV radio um
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
social media as well as um paper and
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
other accessible modes of doing Outreach
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
um we will be asking the vendor to do uh
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
F some focus groups and engaging the
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
public um in terms of what they would
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
like to see or how it will um penetrate
 
01:55:11.709 --> 01:55:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh the population that we want to serve
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
um through this public awareness
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
campaign so I anticipate there may be
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
things that um they will propose that we
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
um don't don't know yet you know there
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
there may be strategies um because I'm
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
and we're working with our public
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
information office too so we will be
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
partnering um with the vendor um with
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
this representative uh
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you for what you're doing
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
it's important work
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
work there's also a subcommittee of this
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee dealing with Alzheimer can you
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee how that
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going to intersect with
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
the work here that you're doing um where
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
is that intersection going to occur and
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
what is going to be come of
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
it thank you for that question I um in
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
my position I've been um newly nominated
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
to sit on that subcommittee and I am
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
waiting information in regards to
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling of those subcommittee
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
meetings and we'll be um as part of that
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
process I imagine that we will be
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussing this plan and giving regular
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
updates um to that subcommittee as well
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for this report uh Miss Alman
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I I for the mostly for the Committees
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
purpose and if I misstate this you know
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
correct me um this this uh program was
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
initially identified uh and put into
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um and the initial draft of
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
the legislation wasn't um particularly
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in terms of the extent of
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
what we would expect and I think we went
 
01:57:16.109 --> 01:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
back and we worked it with the lobbyist
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
and probably back with Miss ultman and
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh really appreciate the level of
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
specificity this is about the right
 
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
level for the legislature to know that
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
you are spending the
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
$500,000 well because that was the
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
initial concern the legislation was so
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
ambiguous we didn't know what we were
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
going to get for half a million dollars
 
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
so this is reassuring thank you thank
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
you for that work um I I I'd also like
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
to just point out for the for the uh
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
mostly for the executive for for the
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee here that um Public Health has
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
the mission of providing public facing
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
education the topic of Alzheimer and
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
dementia has been on the radar for many
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
many years and because Public Health got
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
just just was never able to get to it we
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
thought the special effort was
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate and as I understand it when
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
we get these deliverables and
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
programmatics set up the responsibility
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
to sustain it will shift from you over
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
to Public Health is is that true is that
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
is that's what I understood the plan to
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
be well we haven't discussed uh
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
sustainability of any um ongoing
 
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
Outreach or public awareness but I can I
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
know from my perspective we partner very
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
closely with the division of Public
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
Health and population Health we're um
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
engaging in activities related to um
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
age-friendly Public Health Systems um
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
and brain health um and we're
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating with them to ensure that
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're collecting data and information
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
related to Alzheimer's disease and
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
related dementias in the state um
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
through some of their data collection
 
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
purposes so we've set the stage really
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
for um future engagement and
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
sustainability of this kind of
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
work followup so so this is actually
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
from Miss hen this is a just a comment
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
um that uh one of the concerns when we
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the legislation around this
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
was the potential redundancy and it's
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
great to go ahead and do a new program
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
in the department that it's supposed to
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
be in for the subject matter expertise
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
but I I i' hate to have us come back in
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
two or three budgets from now and see
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
that we've got redundant public
 
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
awareness uh organizations so if you all
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
could just pay attention to what what's
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
the right degree of redundancy and
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
what's the right degree of um alignment
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
great good thank you and thank you thank
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%

02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Solway and I basically
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%

that we really want to be very U
