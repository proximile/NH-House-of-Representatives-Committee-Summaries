didn't put a card in so I didn't know
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
where to go except that I figured that
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%

on oh there it is got it thank
 
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
you good morning chairman Spain members
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is dy fette and
 
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
I the Senate majority caucus director
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce Senate Bill 310 on
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Pearl Senate Bill 310
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
is a request of the fishing game
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
department and would give them the
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
authority to allow bare registration
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
agents to charge a fee for their
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
services and to allow digital
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
confirmation of purchases as a hunter's
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
current and valid Federal duck stamp
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
these changes are viewed as housekeeping
 
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
measures for the department since be
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
registration agents are already
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
authorized to operate under department
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
rules but the department requires
 
00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 align:start position:0%
legislative authority to allow these
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
agents to charge a fee the change to the
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
federal duck stamp will bring state laws
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
into agreement with Federal allowances
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl appreciates your
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
consideration of Senate Bill 310 I will
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
defer any questions to the members of
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game who are behind me as they
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer your questions
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
much better than myself I also
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a non-main
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be happening after
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
this and Senator Pearl uh would like to
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
you nothing anybody got any
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay you're out you're lucky
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
because uh nobody has any questions for
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
you now I will call uh Dan berson for
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
department that on
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
um good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
the committee uh Dan berron I'm the
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
chief of the wildlife division for the
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
fish and game department um U yeah I'll
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
just reiterate very very briefly um this
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
is largely a housekeeping measure we had
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
expanded um registration options for
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
bear um historically bear would have to
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
be registered by Department conservation
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
officers or biologists um we wanted to
 
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
expand opportunity bear Harvest have
 
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
increased over the past several years we
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
wanted more opportunity for hunters uh
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
we wanted to set up some regist station
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
similar we do with deer um currently we
 
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
can allow the setup of the stations but
 
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
not for them to charge a fee similar to
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
how deer registration stations charge a
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
fee for that service um the federal duck
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
stamp um I think it was about a year ago
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
um there was actually a bill that was
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
passed there was a change in the federal
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
regulations that allowed a temporary um
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
electronic duck stamp that you could use
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
for about 45 days until you get your
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
physical stamp uh Federal Regulations
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
have recently changed to allow that to
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
be used throughout the season we're just
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
bringing up our rules to um or our
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
statutes to stay in line with what the
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations are and I'm happy to
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
questions are there any
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um I'll let you go
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
first go for it I was going to go last
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
and I didn't see anybody thank you Mr
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
question just briefly when did the um
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
fishing gam start doing uh bear
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
registration stations this last hunting
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
season was the first season that we had
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
um stations that people could bring
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
their Bears to register them to yeah and
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
I we have a handful that kind of
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
volunteer to do it without charging
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
follow up one more if you you may follow
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
up representative Darby uh thank you Mr
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
chair um and has there been any um my
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
understanding was the reason um fishing
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
game uh conservation officers were uh
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
directly involved was before was to
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
maybe look at the the site where the
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
bear was taken uh make you know a lot of
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
bear hunters use bait and things like
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
that was there has there been any any
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
concern by fish game about um lack of uh
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
information lack of sort of Trace back
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
to where the bear was taken no so we
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
discussed that prior to changing over
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
but they still have the ability to go
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
check those sites if necessary um you
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
know it varies you know typically
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
because there was you know a handful you
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
know we have 40 some odd and I defer to
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
um our our Colonel behind me um 40 some
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
officers throughout the state
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
registering hundreds of bears throughout
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
the season so um there could be quite a
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
lag so typically when they would go to
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
register a bear it wouldn't be at the
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
kill site so they'd have to get the
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
information from the Hunter and go back
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
anyway um and they still have the
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
ability to get that information from the
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hunter and and have them take them back
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
to the site of kill
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
yep question go ahead thank you Mr
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
chairman forgive me if I missed this but
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
the procedure now um to uh to register a
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
kill is what so there 's several options
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
right now for bear um we we do have a
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
handful of registration stations that
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
you can bring your bear to um they're
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
just not able to charge a fee for the
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
service so we had some stations that
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
volunteered to do it for us free of
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
charge um you can also still contact a
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
conservation officer and do it the way
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
that that historically um Hunters have
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
been able to register and you can um you
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
know Regional biological staff can also
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
register a bear for a hunter so there's
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's now three options um biological
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
staff conservation officer or or bring
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
it to uh one of the select registration
 
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.150 align:start position:0%
it to uh one of the select registration
stations

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
y any further
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions mine's been answered so we're
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
good um with that um no further
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
you and the last one I see is Eric
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
Anderson was that actually for this bill
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
or for the non- gerine amendment
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
310 it's for the amendment oh okay then
 
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
2024-25 n h to Senate Bill 310 and call
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
on represent a
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment was a request
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
from the Department um it was basically
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
something that came out of the hearing
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
we had earlier on Landing licenses um
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
and they had realized that they did not
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
have a resident non-commercial version
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
and that in order to create this license
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
they needed to have permission for the
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
director to create such a license so
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
they asked me to put in an amendment uh
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow the director to create
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
such a license and so that's all this
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
does it uh allows any non or actually
 
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
does it uh allows any non or actually
it's

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
it's
uh

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh
non-resident

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-resident
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah non-resident sorry
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
non-resident for personal use uh so it
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
allows a non-resident uh transporting in
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
state waters any crabs or lobsters that
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
were taken outside the jurisdiction of
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
the State uh via ship or vessel so in
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
other words this would affect people who
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
have a moing in New Hampshire but
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
they're lobstering in Massachusetts or
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
in international waters and they're
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
doing it just for their own personal use
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
so they've got a non-commercial license
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts they're just doing
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
their Hobby lobstering and they want to
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
bring their lobsters to shore where
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
their boats mored in New Hampshire
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
and right now um they'd have to buy a
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
full license here so this gives the
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
director the ability to create that
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
license um and put a price on it and
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
legally deal with it and so if there's
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
any questions I can take them but I'd
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
probably defer to the department to
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
answer them better
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative Spain just um out of
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
curiosity you're own personal opinion um
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
I've we heard in previous testimony over
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
Landing licenses that some of um some
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
states do not offer reciprocity what's
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
your opinion on reciprocity um you know
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
reciprocity requirement or um
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
reciprocity um state reciprocity for
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
allowing um personal uh take and landing
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
of licenses by our neighbors well it's a
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
good question but I can tell you that
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of our hunting and fishing
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
uh Licensing in in areas that does not
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity and I can give you a
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
good example of that um quite a number
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
of years ago uh I put in a bill that
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
would extend the discount for veterans
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
that are disabled to be able to have a
 
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.550 align:start position:0%
that are disabled to be able to have a
hunting

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
license and uh we had only one category
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
which was 100% fully disabled could get
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
a free hunting license in New Hampshire
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we had reciprocity with Vermont and
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
Maine for that but in order for us to
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
create this next tier which was 85%
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
disabled up to 99% disabled for a
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
discount on their lifetime hunting
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
license uh we had to remove the
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
Reciprocity for that category so um we
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
were not going to be giving that to
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
Hunters in Maine and Vermont either just
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents they were
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
veterans so there's a lot of those areas
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
where we do not have reciprocity and
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a problem it's a
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
common thing uh and in those instances
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
people just buy the license in the state
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
activity any other
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions Mr thanks for taking my
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
question turn on your mic
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
um so a local resident who's not fishing
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Waters but fishing in
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
federal waters wants to land their
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
Lobster in New Hampshire are they now
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
required to buy the commercial we have
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
$40 we do that okay have
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to make sure they didn't
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
have to buy the commercial LIC no no no
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
we just didn't have one for non-resident
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
to to do that for their personal use
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
and honestly in talking with fishing
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
game maybe a handful of people might do
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
this it's not a a big number because uh
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
again you'd have to be landing your boat
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but you're an outof
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
State person so it's it's pretty much
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
limited to those people who happen to
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
have a moing or or a friend who has a
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
moing and they're coming to visit their
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
friend or what have you and they're
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
bringing their lobsters or crabs or what
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
have you from the other
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
state and they're perfectly 100%
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
licensed in the other state for the
 
00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.949 align:start position:0%
licensed in the other state for the
activity

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
too any other
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you very much um for
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
testifying on this um my concern with
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
is probably for informational purposes
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
I've consistently supported fishing game
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
in the variety of you know legislation
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
that comes before you and and still
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
support that but I think for
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
informational purposes there are issues
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
that I I have questions about and um you
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
know it seems to be that we're catering
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
this this particular amendment is
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
catering to non-residents with regards
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
to your question about reciprocity I did
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
check that out um there is not like for
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
likee reciprocity between Massachusetts
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire on this a individual
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
from m Massachusetts can come up here
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
and purchase a license non non-com well
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
if this goes forward purchase a
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
non-commercial personal um a
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
non-commercial license and the fees yet
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
to be established and that's all he has
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
to do if there was a New Hampshire
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
resident that wanted to go to
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and get a similar
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
license he can do it but and that's the
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
butt he has to own $5,000 worth of
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
property in
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think that's relatively
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
clear it's not like for like
 
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.669 align:start position:0%
clear it's not like for like
reciprocity

00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so I think for I I just wanted to
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
bring that forward for for informational
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
purposes because it was we because it
 
00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:17.149 align:start position:0%
purposes because it was we because it
was

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussed um also in
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um they're allowed to take
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
diving which is not allowed in State of
 
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
diving which is not allowed in State of
New

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now I don't know the fiscal
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
impact or you know what the what the
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
size of you know the type of licenses
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
this will um produce but it it
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's with the fact that they can
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
come that they can die for lobsters in
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and bring them to New
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where it's not legal it seems
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
like a non-resident
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
has more entitlement to the harvesting
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
of lobsters than a New Hampshire
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
resident because it's not allowed in New
 
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
resident because it's not allowed in New
Hampshire

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that's a factor in just
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
my you know I think it could be easily
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
fixed if the was language in there I I
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
see it on line 19 if they could just say
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
um after and crabs in the state if they
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
could say by means of trap and that
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
would make the issue equal between the
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
two states rather than have um an
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
individual go Bringing In lobsters from
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that they caught by diving
 
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.669 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that they caught by diving
so

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
um I support the Department's position
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
on this I think the front end of the
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill on 310 is the most important part
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I just ask you know I'm just bringing
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
this information to you for your
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
consideration on whether adding the the
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate thank you very
 
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:06.790 align:start position:0%
much thank you any
 
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.470 align:start position:0%
much thank you any
[Music]

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
Brown I'm s go ahead sorry uh thank you
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so to be clear uh my
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
recollection is that this license for
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would only
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
be for those fishing outside of New
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's jurisdiction lobstering
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire's jurisdiction
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
yes what you're saying is in
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
may get a lobster inside Massachusetts
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and bring it to New
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's your
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
concern yes and it's it's it's it's not
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
that that's the main concern it's the
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
means of
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
harvesting diving full Ops is legal in
 
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
New H in Massachusetts it's not legal in
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so it seems to be that a
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts resident can Harvest
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by diving in Massachusetts
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
state waters and this would allow them
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
to bring those lobsters into New
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with this non-commercial
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
license okay where a New Hampshire
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
resident couldn't do the same okay thank
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
you follow up Mr chair follow up
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
so again to be clear if if anyone
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
corrects me if I'm wrong you can collect
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
lobsters outside of New Hampshire Waters
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
off of the New Hampshire Coastline by
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
diving if you're outside of New
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jurisdictional Waters right
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
and you're outside of New Hampshire
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're technically in federal waters but
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
you you can you can do that at this
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
point whether it's federal waters or
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
state and Massachusetts Waters you're
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to you're allowed to harvest
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%

enforcement worked on this bill and uh
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
we would agree that it it's certainly uh
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's certainly enforceable and that the
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%

for taking my question
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering um sorry I'm wondering
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
if what the rules are in in Maine for um
 
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
if what the rules are in in Maine for um
Landing

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
Landing
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
lobsters I can't speak specifically for
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
Maine I what I can tell you is that
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
Maine is has very stringent uh Lobster
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh landing and um and and just
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
lobstering laws period um due to the
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
fact that um generally it's it's just a
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
resident residential or resident um take
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
of lobsters um they even have laws that
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
extend out into federal waters which we
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
do not have in this state um so if a
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
main resident or a holder of a license
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
um would be um could be or main laws
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
could be enforced in federal waters for
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
those persons holding a a lobster
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
license in
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
main one more follow thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you again um how would um with
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
respect to enforceability um how would
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
you be how would the um Department um
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
conservation officers be able to
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
determine if a lobster caught by a
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
non-resident was caught in New Hampshire
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
Waters versus outside of New Hampshire
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
them it would be difficult at the I mean
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
at the initial contact to where it was
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
landed I mean certainly cases like that
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
developed over time um if it's someone
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's legally taking within state
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
waters or in federal waters and landing
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire It
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
generally takes a little more than just
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
that initial contct so it's more of
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
investigative uh they would be you know
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
finding that person taking lobsters you
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
know out in the field and developing
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
information that way and and creating
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
doubt any other
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

uh that's the last pink card anyone else
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
none I'll close the public hearing on
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%

request of the fishing game department
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the past Hunters have had to
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
transport deer to a physical station for
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
registration and issuance of deer seals
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%

establishment of an online registration
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
berson right after him I want to do the
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
amendment at the
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
end good morning again um Dan bergon
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
chief of the wildlife division for
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game um yeah this is this is
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
very much so a housekeeping bill um with
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
the change to electronic registration
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
stations um obviously when when
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
someone's doing it online there's no
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
ability to give them um you know metal
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
SEALS or anything so they print out a
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
confirmation number or they can save
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
their confirmation number um so as
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to having multiple forms of ways
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
that we have to track these things
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of administrative work for
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
the Department um we've switched over to
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
now confirmation numbers this is just
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
updating the language and there's
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
various rsas throughout um that
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
reference seals um to the old way we
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
used to do things we're just looking to
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
you he's deferring to the department but
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
we will have them next which is why we
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to have this discussed now God
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%

questions for the amendment
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
required we didn't have a paper version
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
of that right I don't think we got a
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
copy of that it's getting passed around
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
again representative Derby you're
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um actually
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
I did have a a tech a question regarding
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill that I forgot to
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
ask on line
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
25 um it talks about provide a
 
00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:56.310 align:start position:0%
25 um it talks about provide a
registration

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
number but in um both sections one and
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
two of the bills it says a registration
 
00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.630 align:start position:0%
two of the bills it says a registration
confirmation

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
confirmation
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
number and so um I'm wondering if those
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
are intended to be the same
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
thing and if um since the uh the the
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
terminology seems to be registration
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
confirmation number and we have a an
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
T um yeah I don't I don't think we would
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that to put just put
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
confirmation in there make it consistent
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
throughout that would be fine with
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
us the and just real quick to speak to
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
the the amendment this was this was
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
originally included in the in the bill
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
that we um asked to have sponsored it
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
was accidentally left out by OS and we
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
didn't catch it until um after it had
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
been introduced in the Senate so um but
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
again it's it's all the same subject
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
matter thank you and and I think I'll
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'll point out
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh on line 13 it does say the
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
registration confirmation number and on
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
line 11 it says registration
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
confirmation number y in the original
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it's line 25 which is what I
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
was talking about yeah it just says
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
registration number but not confirmation
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
got you okay we could actually send
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
someone down to have the word
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
confirmation added into the amendment uh
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
before we hear that in exec session so
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be a problem if we want to
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
get the language all nice and clean
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
up uh are there any other questions
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%

the committee Senator David Waters
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
District 4 to introduce uh Senate Bill
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
503 relative requiring criminal back
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
ground check when applying for fishing
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
game guide
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
license um the the key to this bill uh
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
is on line 7 where it says every new
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
applicant applying for uh New Hampshire
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
guides license for the first time shall
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
submit to the fishing game department of
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
criminal history record release form um
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
and also a set of uh
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprints um what is what how the way
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
we amended the bill in the Senate was to
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's first time got got app
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
so that we're not um adding costs uh to
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
this um process or having people repeat
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
it who have been through it once um the
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
necessity for the um fingerprinting is
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can obtain criminal records
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
from jurisdictions Beyond the state of
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I think the basic uh
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to supplement
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
what we already have to make sure that
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
um people who use guide services are
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
safe um this is a very important
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
relationship guide we'll have with folks
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh in their in their guiding and um the
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
public is the right to know that we've
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
done our due um diligence uh so I think
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that uh what made this bill workers in
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate is to make sure that it's for
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
first time first time applicants only
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
that were uh re requesting this there's
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
a small technical change in the bill as
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
well uh about on the early lines about
 
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.670 align:start position:0%
well uh about on the early lines about
the

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
design um there as you'll see on uh line
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
three the executive director or to their
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
designate just a grammatical cleanup on
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
on that one um I know we've got folks
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
here from the Department to um talk more
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
about the practicalities and the reason
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward but uh if you
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
want to ask me questions I can answer
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
but you'll probably get better answers
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
from them thank you are there any
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Derby thank you
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Senator waters for
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question and just to confirm
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
this would apply to all guides fishing
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
and hunting guides anybody who has a has
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
a a guide license okay thank you thank
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions I have one myself you may
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
defer to the fishing game department if
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
you do not know the answer was my
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
understanding because I thought we
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
already did this for guides it was my
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that we can do this for
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
any Resident who applies for a guide
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
license but we could not mandate that
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
somebody from out of state who applies
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
go through the background check and this
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
would just bring us on par so that
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
residents are treat Tre the same or
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
non-residents are treated the same as we
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
treat our residents is that not correct
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and they can
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
further discuss that but that's the
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
point of the fingerprints so that we can
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
get somebody's from another jurisdiction
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
we can get that that safety uh as well
 
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.109 align:start position:0%
we can get that that safety uh as well
thank

00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%

well it was a compliment I don't know
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
how or why quite frankly that you do
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
this but thank goodness that you do it
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
before we start I want to thank you for
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
all the work this year uh with all of
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
the different bills I appreciate the the
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
hospitality we receive over here on a
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
regular basis so I am Kevin Jordan I'm
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the chief of law enforcement for a New
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and I'm here to
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
testify in support of Senate Bill 503
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
the commission voted on this bill and
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
voted to support it once we explained um
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose behind it and so just to
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
give you a little background any any
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
fishing or hunting guide now resident or
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
non-resident we run their criminal
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
backgrounds but by state law we're only
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that within the state of
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if I get a
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts resident who applies for a
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
non-resident guides license I can check
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
his criminal background in New Hampshire
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
but I cannot go out of the state and
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
check other states and I can't check a
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
resident uh in another a resident from
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for another state so I
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
could be a New Hampshire Hunter I could
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
commit a felony in Vermont reapply for
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
my guides license and there would be no
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
way that I would be able to um see if
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
that occurred without this bill so
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
initially we wanted it done we wanted to
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
require every applicant to submit
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
fingerprints pay the 48 to 50
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
$48.50 fee to have a complete criminal
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
background from across the country uh
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
done the problem with that is it
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
increased the guides licenses by some
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
$50 which was a the guides we worked
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
with the guides Association which by the
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
way supports this bill as well couldn't
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
be here today but asked me to tell you
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
that um that was their only concern was
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
the headache of getting fingerprints
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
each year or each time they got their
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
license and paying this additional fee
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
so we kind of compromised on this
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
onetime check my feeling is and it's and
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion frankly that once we get
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
them in the system once I we know who
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
they are and they are guiding here in
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that if they were to an
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
offense a felony offense outside of the
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire we'd be more
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
likely to know that than I would before
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
they became a guide so we agreed to do
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
it in that fashion um and then the last
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
thing I want to remind you of is before
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
this committee and I think Senator
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
Waters was on the committee I know uh
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman was on it we did have a
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
felon uh who was taking out Children uh
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
in Bob houses and offending them he was
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
a convicted felon before he got his gu's
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
license we did not know that we issued
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
him a license and he used that as a tool
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm fearful of that um I want to make
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
sure that people take folks out in the
 
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
woods that they're uh good people and
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't done those kinds of things
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
and this is the only way I can I can be
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure of that thank you thank you any
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions I'll have one yes sir this is
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a followup and continuation of
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we did earlier uh several years ago
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
to pass the uh legislation that said
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
that a person with a
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
criminal sexual record couldn't take uh
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't Mentor people that's correct in
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
the woods correct that's correct yes sir
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions seeing none
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
thank you colel thank you sir thank you
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
Colonel always a pleasure you
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
too and I don't have any more pink cards
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
is there anyone wishing to speak on the
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill that has not yet
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
503 your amendment's small on that right
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that in exact
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
session and your
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
15 we're going to take another little
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
break because uh we're 15 minutes early
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
and I believe Senator Waters is our next
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
one as well and he's in an exec session
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
um we'll be on recess
 
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
um we'll be on recess
until

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.119 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
11:10

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:55.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
is might as well use this as an
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
educational moment for the committee uh
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
this happens a lot in fishing game uh OS
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
likes to put an effective date starting
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
60 days on a lot of our stuff by default
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
and frequently we have to wait because
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
it has to be going through a lot of
 
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.990 align:start position:0%
it has to be going through a lot of
legislative

00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh stuff to get it instituted with rul
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
making and everything so we can't do
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
everything within 60 days so we have to
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
delete it and if you do draft a bill for
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
this committee try to always start on
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
January 1st it's always safe that way
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's much harder to now amend it
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
I might as well say that too it it's
 
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
been a pleasure having you all in the
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
committee this this uh term and uh I
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing you on the
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee again next term however we may
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
fall out after elections but uh I think
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
we've had a great term here it's been
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
for the most part non-c contentious and
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh we've gotten some good things done
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
and and we've ended up the the the term
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
without fishing game hating us so that's
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
a reminder to people too we've got the
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
guns on the 15th at 8:30 a.m. over at
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
the Sig place um which is in
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
eping uh we've got uh some members from
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
fishing game that the colonel still
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't told me their names or anything
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
we got four or
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
so have four I think I gave you four
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and then uh we've got some
 
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:11.829 align:start position:0%
yeah and then uh we've got some
Commissioners

01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
coming not not sure how many
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are actually coming
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
because I don't think I've heard from
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
all of them but I did hear from about
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
five or six that can't make it so
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
I think I think I might have heard from
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
three or four that are they're coming
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
and and I've heard from about four or
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
five I think that can't make
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
it um but then I've I think I've heard
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
from most of the committee members and
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
if you haven't responded yet please
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
do and Mike would you like to talk about
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
we've got a few minutes for you to talk
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
about the four-wheeler trip
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
too thank you um we're in the process of
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
putting a a day together um a big part
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
of fishing game and how they deal with
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire through
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
their law enforcement of the motorized
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
Motorsports and we don't see a lot of it
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't hear a lot of it in committee so
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
I've worked with a rental uh
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
organization up north to supply side by
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
sides to any of the fishing game
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
committee members come up for a day uh
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
tourists up through the area hopefully
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
through Jericho Park includes some of
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
our fishing game members and Bureau
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
trails and just get a feel of what the
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
great Northwoods is like
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the only uh we have to pick a date uh
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
the only uh caveat is it's got to be
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
midweek um but um the rental house is
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
prepared we'll have the local club or
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
someone Supply lunches for us and uh you
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
know a nice three or four hour tour
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
through the uh through the North
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
Country so we've got the date still TBD
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
but Mike's going to come up with
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
something real soon and uh I asked him
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
to do it after we finish our last
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
session day so we don't have to worry
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
about that um and and Colonel Jordan do
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know who's going to be up in Patrol
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
in that area and who covers that area'll
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'm getting a feeling Scott Wallace
 
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
might show up
 
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
might show up
[Laughter]

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%

Waters good morning and thank you uh to
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
be brief this is uh a bill to establish
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
a committee to study fishing game
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
department funding and Partnerships um
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
we uh uh ask and demand fishing game to
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
do more things where they've been
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
self-funded in the past um and as a
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislature we wanted and we did give
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
our uh employees raises last year and
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're having a hard time funding them
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
out of their budget so it's time to look
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
at other funding Avenues and um the best
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
way to to help keep them afloat and this
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%

you I'm not going to entertain questions
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
since he's just introducing it for
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters but when Senator Waters
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um we don't have take a
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
position on the underlying Bill we just
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
they just asked me to flag um lines 24
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
through 27
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
on page one um deals with 206 2A of
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications for the fishing Game
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Commission um and as you all know
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier this year this committee um sent
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
house bow 1148 to interim study which
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
also dealt with uh the fishing gameing
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
at the fishing Game Commission so we
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag it as far as um if
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an interim study uh
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee already meeting this summer
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe um this commission doesn't need to
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
directly act on it so um that's the only
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to flag um reading
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
through the bill but happy to take any
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
other questions that folks might have
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
much chair now recognizes um William
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
Bosworth representing himself and the
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
Coalition thank you Mr chairman I'm

said are representing the New Hampshire
 
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
said are representing the New Hampshire
wildlife

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
Coalition um first of all I find myself
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the same side as the fishing game and
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
in supporting this
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh but I have to ask the question
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
why do we re revisit this issue every
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
few years in 2007 the legislative audit
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee did a great audit of fishing
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
game and came up with 30 recommendations
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
that related to funding and
 
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
organization very few if any were
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
actually implemented and in 2018 Senate
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 48 the hearings of which I sat
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
through eight of them uh were who were
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
charged to look at the operations of uh
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
fishing game basically Sid stepped the
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
issue of the organization and and focus
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
primarily on funding which was great but
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the G end of the day only
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of their recommendations even got to
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislation and that died in committee
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
or was ited at least
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm hoping that this one will
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
get a little bit
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
further one of the things that uh
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
I I guess I have a problem with is
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
representation of people like
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
organizations such as ours which are
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
Wildlife advocacy organization are not
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
represented on the commission and it's
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
my belief that if we had a broader
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
commission more organizations
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
represented sugested at the original
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill with Senator Waters Native
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
Americans conservation agent uh
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and so forth that maybe
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
there'd be some uh support for some of
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
these funding ideas at least a little
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
more support presently there's only
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
40,000 people in the state 40,000
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
residents that actually buy a hunting
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
license or a combo license hunting and
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
fishing about 3% of New Hampshire's
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
population so you have a commission that
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
largely represents those people there's
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
a heck of a lot of other people that
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
have a very high interest in wildlife in
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
fact studies that have been done show
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the people who are so-called
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Watchers who watch Wildlife up
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
close who photograph it who feed it
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
outnumber Sportsmen by 3 to one and they
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
spend more money as
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
well the present uh RSA 2062 and 2A
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
really establishes a couple of
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
requirements that make it very tough for
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
an organiz organization like a wildlife
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization to get on they
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
require that that organization having
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
its bylaws that they promote
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
hunting and while many organizations
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
like ours do not oppose it I think it's
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
absurb to think that a organization that
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
a conservation organization is going to
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
promote hunting the other thing that
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
makes an exclusionary is the requirement
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
to hold a hunting license or a trapping
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
or fishing license for five of the prior
 
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.669 align:start position:0%
or fishing license for five of the prior
10

01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
years so not everybody in the state that
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
loves Wildlife is going to have a uh a
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
license to kill them so I I I'm just
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
saying that we have to make this a
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
little more
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable wildlife in New Hampshire are
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
a public trust resource and as such
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
they're held in trust for all citizens
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
all 1.4 million not just the 30,000 buy
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
a hunting license and the 70,000 that
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
buy a fishing license so it's
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
my wish that if this committee gets
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
together that they spend a lot of time
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
organization and perhaps by doing
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
something about it the funding issues
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
solved thank you very much for your time
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
I'd take any questions thank you very
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
remember it that's right anybody have
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
question you didn't say this
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
specifically but are you suggesting that
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Watchers would then be somehow
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in some way to contribute to
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
fishing games
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
management of of game fish and game uh
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting is the commission
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
which is right now uh restricted to
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
those people that are nominated by
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
sporting clubs and typically are are uh
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
basically enthusiastic supporters of the
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
hunting and trapping community be
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
broadened by having commission members
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
who come from different walks of life
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
but still have an interest in Wildlife I
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
I understand that thank you did you have
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
no okay any other
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%

recognizes Colonel Jordan
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
oh actually Senator Waters you can come
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
in now I forgot I didn't have your card
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%

it uh thank you Mr chairman Senator
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
Waters District 4 and my again my deep
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
apologies to you Mr chair and the
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee we got tangled up in votes and
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't look at my watch so here I am
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the uh bill being
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
introduced in my my absence and if I um
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
let me just start at the beginning with
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
this uh I as you know the underlying
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill um was a different thing to look at
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
the uh commission and um some other
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
folks related to it and we ended up
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
having a very long conversation in the
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
hearing about issues surrounding the
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
funding of the department going forward
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
and um so that's why it resulted that
 
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
working with Colonel Jordan and with the
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
director and with others that we asked
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
for this study committee to look at the
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
funding issues if I may I will look
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
think back to 16 years ago when I my
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
first term when I was here on this
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
committee and we had just received um
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
the audit of the department and we
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
really spent the next um four years
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
under chairman Abbott and CH chairman
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hopper um looking at the all kinds of
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
things fishing game and um a few years
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
later arising from the continuing
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
funding concerns we did the hike safe
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
pass and for the first time uh added
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
some general funding for fish and game
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think those conversations made
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
us all aware of the of the fact of the
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
challenges uh here given the mix of
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
resources coming into the fishing game
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
um Department um I think what's become
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
rather apparent since that time uh are
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
the continuing challenges in particular
 
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
you know thank you thank you to governor
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
sonunu for funding the raises in this
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
budget for fish and
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
game but that funding will run out and
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
the department will be expected to pick
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
that up that might mean layoffs of what
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
eight or nine people in the in the
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
department so that's going to be
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
immediate challenge for the budget
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
writers next time but in the longer term
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to me that we really needed
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
to really look very honestly at what are
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
the funding needs going to be going
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
forward and what are what is the role
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to be of other funding sources and
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the general fund so in looking
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
at the in the bill I thought about a
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
couple things you know yes we got to get
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
a good handle on what projections are
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
about um about revenues and so forth um
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
and I will say you know looking back to
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
what we did about the hike safe pass
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the concerns about the search and
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
rescue funding which can sometimes be
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
quite enormous have not gone away uh
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
made some some progress on it with the
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
hik safe pass but you know a couple of
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
extensive and dangerous searches and
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
rescues and we can be in real budgetary
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
problems there it also seemed to me
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
though um that we have a lot of work
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
that if you look at what the fish and
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
game department does I mean it it is you
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
know under sight evaluation committee
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
for uh Power projects Dees hands off to
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game a lot of the examination of
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
what impacts there might be there and
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
and you know across all kinds of
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
development issues and so forth um
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game is you know asked to to
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
play its role in determining um
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of all kinds of
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
construction projects um then also a a
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
lot of its work overlaps very much with
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
what are land land conservancies and of
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
course with outdoor recreation um that's
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
now a multi-billion dollar industry in
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the state and uh really it depends a lot
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
on the work of fishing game department
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those lands are
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
available for people who want to
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
recreate as well as hunt and and fish so
 
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
um that's why I have down here um not
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
just you know under line 18 18 and 19
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
consider proposal for General funding
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
needs sustaining programs operations not
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
provided by federal funding but also
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
might not we look on lines 20 to 23 um
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
at these other groups you know
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture we had in the hearing too a
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
lot of talk with um you know Agriculture
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
and Timber interest because it happened
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
at the the Farm Bureau and the
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
Timberland Association folks were there
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
that that day as well and I followed up
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
with them too um you know they all we're
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
all doing the same kind of thing making
 
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
sure that we have uh lands available so
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
I thought that you know maybe there'd be
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
some Partnerships with those uh groups
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
and that they might be able to bring
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
some f some funding from their
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
membership towards fishing game as well
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
now that's why I had on lines 24 to 27
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
well if we're going to if they're going
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
to be funding Partners maybe they ought
 
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
to have some role consultancy with the
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
commission I kind of think it might make
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
sense cuz what I've heard since time is
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
that maybe just strike lines 24 to 27 I
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't think they're they're necessary in
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
terms of this study maybe that is
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
something that will evolve later on as a
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
consideration but I think this study is
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
really about funding and potential uh
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
partnership so I I I think that um you
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
might strike 24
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
to um 27 and then uh might want to look
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
at 20633 about um enhancing funding
 
01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.790 align:start position:0%
at 20633 about um enhancing funding
partnership

01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
um and in those kinds of areas so I'm
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
sorry to take a little bit time Mr
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
chairman but um you know given my ever
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
since I'm in the legislature my
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
commitment to fishing game and the great
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
job the department does you know Colonel
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%

sure that they have the funding they
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
need thank you thank you Senator are
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%

01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement New Hampshire fishing game I
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't think I could have said it much
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
better than Senator Waters did um you
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
know with the the uh search and rescue
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
funding crisis we I came over here for
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
some 16 18 years asking for more more
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
adequate funding and and we could prove
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
and did prove through statistics that
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
the sports men and women were paying the
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
Lion Share of that and yet they were
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
receiving probably 3 to 4% of the
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
services and so that argument would we
 
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
went round and round over all kinds of
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
different ways to fund that through
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and general uh General
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
um funding um and we settled on a hike
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
safe card which really to be honest with
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
you wasn't I wasn't a fan of in the
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
beginning and it does create a bit of a
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
problem when you budget because you're
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
budgeting for what you hope will come in
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit of a challenge but
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
the good news is since
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
2015 we've exceeded $200,000 every year
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
this year we're going to hit 300,000 so
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's been a huge help to have some of
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
that money come in from the people that
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
are actually receiving the services so
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's been a great um Advantage
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
it kind of planted the seed for this so
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
when Senator Waters came up with a bill
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
this year to look at the commission and
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
I went in screaming that our big problem
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
isn't our commission our big problem
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
isn't representation our big problem is
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
paying for it moving forward and it's
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
getting worse and worse every year
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
because the the cost of everything
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
including salaries you know the governor
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
was gracious enough to give the
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
employees a 10% raise I didn't we didn't
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
increase uh income by 10% so we're not
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
going to make it and and I'm worried I'm
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to lose my Governor I'm about to
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
lose my director um and so there's no
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
good on the horizon for that so and
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
we've had bills like this we've had
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 48 which I know some of you
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
are familiar with where we've studied
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
the funding of of the commission but let
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
me tell you how those work i' I've seen
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
this happen and I don't want it to
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
happen this time what typically happens
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
is people good people will get together
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
and come up with ideas on how to better
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
fund the agency like they're small ideas
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of them they are things like um
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
we've tried adding registration costs to
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
boats we've tried registering kayaks
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried um you know a whole host or
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
gamut of ideas not that those are bad
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
ideas but those are not going to take
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
care of our issues we need millions of
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
dollars not
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds what I would like to see happen
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
with this come up with an idea or a
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
willingness to general fund the agency
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
like every other agency is in the state
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire mostly and then give me
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
the ideas to go out and reduce that cost
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
then I'll listen to the ideas of maybe
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
increasing this cost maybe doing
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
something different over here some of
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
the some of the more Band-Aid cost of
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
that but give the initial funding so the
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
pressure is off us we can continue to do
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
the good work that we do and then we'll
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
come up with ways to reduce that each
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
year I'm all about that I I would be
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
100% in favor what scares me is these
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
little ideas that end up a lot of times
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
costing us more money for administrative
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
cost to implement than we get from the
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
actual funding I'm not saying they're
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
bad I'm saying they're not enough I'd
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
like to see it go the other way this
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
time as far as representation on the
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
commission I'm going to tell you
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
something a personal feeling about
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
representation everybody in the state of
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire including everybody in
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
this room benefits from the work that
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game does without question if
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
you like seeing animals if you like a
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
healthy turkey population a healthy
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
moose population or coming back a the
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
best deer population we've had in the
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
history since I've lived here that comes
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
from the hard work of the people s
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me not me but Dan and his
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
team um and the management and and and
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
determinedness of uh determination of
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
the officers in the field to make sure
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
that these rules are followed everybody
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
benefits from that everybody benefits
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
from it but there's a small percentage
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
paying for it I'd welcome anybody to the
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
table just come with your checkbook I
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
want to see you pay just like the
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
hunters and the fisherman do that I
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that's unreasonable and I
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
think going to the general fund is an
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that now if you do
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
that I've said to my
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
commission there's going to have to be a
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about who is on that
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
commission I think in time but I think
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's premature to do it now because
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
their funding is not it's coming in but
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's at a greatly reduced amount
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
compared to what the sportsmen and women
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
are doing um I think bringing everybody
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
on board for funding this agency is a
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
great idea and then we can talk about
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
who's going to represent it I think then
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
that is a more sensible argument but the
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
idea of coming in and having input
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
without your check is not a good idea
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's not helpful that's not going to
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
solve our problem I don't need
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
information I need money that's what we
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
need to run this agency the last thing I
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with is we do you know
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
there was a time when I first started in
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
fishing game where you actually could do
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement you could check hunters
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
and fishermen and that was your day now
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
we steal time to do that I literally
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
steal time to do that because we're
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
doing rabies calls we're doing nuisance
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
animal calls we're doing search and
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
rescue it's becoming more and more
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
involved every day that's okay we're
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
doing that I've got a staff of really
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
energetic people thank goodness um much
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
younger than me that that work hard
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
every day and I'm willing to do that but
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is unfunded a lot of it is
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
unfunded and the Sportsman's dollars are
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
paying for the fuel the insurance the
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
salaries of these people it's time for
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
everybody to step up and the only way to
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
do that is two two funding mechanisms
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm can think of is General General
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
funds or rooms and meals um and I know
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're both hard cells I understand
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
that but losing this agency is is going
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
to be worse I think and and we're
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting closer to that each year we
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
really are that's that's all I have sir
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Colonel are there
 
01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
colonel Vice chair goalie and then
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan for taking my question um
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
being the chair of the Senate Bill 48
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
study committee um I saw some of the
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
things that happened there and um some
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
of the Quest and one of the things that
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
was put into that report was dealing
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
with the hearings
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
process putting it with fishing game so
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
you could collect the dollars for each
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
one of
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
those hearings that took place and the
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
monies instead of going to um was it
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
State Police that was doing I forget who
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
was doing for court summonses yes yes
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
fines yes yes yes
 
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
was five years ago that that report was
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
written yes and that hasn't been done
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
yet correct no sir no we haven't changed
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
the legislation to allow for that that
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
is that was one of the one of the ideas
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
that came out of that study committee
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
and it's also one that we have talked
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
about internally for quite some time and
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
that is to bring funding from our fines
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
directly back into the agency and cut
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
out the contributions to police
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
standards and training the courts um I
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
that would be met probably with some
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
opposition from some of these other
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
groups certainly but it would help fund
 
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
the agency yes that was one of the ideas
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
that came out of
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
that and one other follow follow go
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
ahead I mean we also had the
 
01:34:37.199 --> 01:34:38.750 align:start position:0%
ahead I mean we also had the
recommendation

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
of kayaks and canoes permitting for boat
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
launches because we
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
knew 50% plus of launches are for car
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
top only carriers and these folks are
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
paying nothing towards that right we
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
tried that as well and I think people
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
here know the number of canoes and
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
kayaks in this state that use launches
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
is substantial I think that could have
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
raised not just nickels and dimes right
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
would have raised a substantial amount
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
we tried that here in that legislature
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
and went it ended up going through to
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
just a voluntary and it it's unfortunate
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
and my question is you know you bring up
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
the point of doing these reports and
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
hoping something comes out of it well we
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
did that report we had some good things
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
with do you think that there's going to
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
be a real solution that comes out of
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
this that will pass this house and get
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
put into statute to fund fishing game
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
because I think we had a lot of good
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
ideas in that last report that didn't
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
get done I I think you do if you go
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
after one thing I think in the past
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've gone after 50 different things I
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
think if we go after General funds
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
period nothing else General funds fund
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
the agency then come up with the idea
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
ideas like you're discussing and we'll
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
reduce that general fund input each year
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's a better way to go we've
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
never done it that way we've always gone
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
after rooms and meals or general fund
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then it splinters off into that I
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
think concentrate on getting the funding
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
because that's what's needed now that
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
requires all these other ideas would
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
require legislation some follow-up work
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
to be done I think get the general funds
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
get the agency funded period then go
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
back with some of the ideas and see if
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
we can reduce that cost each year I
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
think we can I think there's some good
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
ideas out there but we need the funding
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and what typically
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
happens is we Splinter off into these
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
little these other little ideas some of
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
them happen some of them don't um and
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
our problem lingers on and we're just at
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
a point where we can't linger anymore
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time so let's get
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
the funding from a single Source now um
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
and and you know you can also make the
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
argument if it comes out of General
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
funds then the people with a kak and the
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
canoes are paying because it's coming
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
out of General funds everybody's paying
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
which is really the only fair way I
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
think to do that everybody benefits not
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
just the kayakers everybody benefits
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
from it thank you representative Derby
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
you still have a question you're
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes good
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
questions by the way well thank you very
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
much sir um I'm just curious how many
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
conservation officers uh fishing game uh
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
currently has and how many how many
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
billets or how many what's the maximum
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
they could have so so right now the
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
governor gave us four other well I kind
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
of split it with him he gave us four
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions back so I agreed to
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
pay for two of those out of OHV money
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
because we are finally at a point where
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
we can support that and he gave me two
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
additional ones so we are in the process
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
right now of hiring four more I will
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
have 48 that will be the highest number
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
of conservation officers we've had since
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
the 70s I could use 148 but 48 is better
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
than where we've been so we're not
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
having trouble recruiting we're we're
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
getting reduced numbers when people
 
01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
apply but we still are are having very
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
good luck uh finding quality people we
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
just hired two more women very excited
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
about that they're both they both come
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
with uh experience and they're both very
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
energetic and we hired three young men
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
that just finished the academy uh two
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
weeks ago so we're we're gaining ground
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
in that regard excellent thank you yes
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any more cards was
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
there anybody who did not get a chance
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
to speak who wants to
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
speak seeing none I will close the
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on which one was this
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
we've got about seven minutes you can
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
caucus before the
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh for the executive session if you'd
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
like and uh I believe the Democrats are
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
going out with uh chairman Vice chairman
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
goalie into the Hall uh if the
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans wanted to step into my off
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
office we could do it there out of the
 
01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.790 align:start position:0%
office we could do it there out of the
public

01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%

01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to move OTP on the this
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
second representative Tudor
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
seconds I'll now speak to it uh very
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
briefly you all heard the discussion on
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
it there was one thing that I did he
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to uh respond to which is
 
01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to uh respond to which is
uh

01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
any any implication that uh we should
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire what the legal
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
methods of take are in any other state
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
is off bounds for us we don't police in
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how the hunting rules are
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
set up or the fishing rules are set up
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
in other states if they can legally die
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
for lobsters in Massachusetts and they
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow the law in Massachusetts and they
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
bring those they they do that and
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're licensed we're just saying they
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
can land them in New Hampshire it
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference um we do the
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
same thing with hunting laws that vary
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
from from uh state to state sometimes a
 
01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
method of take is not the same in one
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
state as another we still allow someone
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
to bring the the animal back to New
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I don't think it's I
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it's something we need to
 
01:53:00.069 --> 01:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
concern ourselves with as long as they
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
follow the laws in that state and the
 
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
animals are legally
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
gotten then we should be able to have a
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
landing license for them and that's
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
where I'll leave my comments on and why
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
I support
 
01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
it is there any okay uh representative
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair so I I support
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment as well um I do hope that
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
um our neighboring state realize that
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're offering um a benefit to their
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
residents um and they may reciprocate
 
01:53:32.069 --> 01:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
with similar um uh out ofate um
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
non-commercial Landing licenses because
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
there are people that land in Northern
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or or launch their boats
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
out of Northern Massachusetts Waters
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
where this would benefit them but I
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
support this because I think that New
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can be you know can set the
 
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
standard here I appreciate that cuz I
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think that they should
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
be reciprocal to us any further comment
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%

allow the uh clerk to call the rooll and
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
if there's not too much we can just do
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
it by a show of hands unless people are
 
01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.079 align:start position:0%

01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%

02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%

okay and if I may Mr chair um all this
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendment does is we heard Senator
 
02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
Waters testify to uh
 
02:04:58.830 --> 02:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
striking those striking lines 24 through
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
27 um BEC regarding the makeup of the
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
commission um and I had this amendment
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
drafted for that reason uh those of us
 
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
on the committee know that we have a
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill that we intrum studied uh that
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
deals with the makeup of the commission
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
that will be looked at in another way
 
02:05:18.549 --> 02:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
and I just don't think it's right to
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
have two separate entities look at the
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
same issue at the same time I think it's
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
more it's a just as important to have a
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
separate bill looking at a commission
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the funding efficient game we
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
had heard how important that is and
 
02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
letting a different group this committee
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
deal with the commission part of it and
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
the inim study so I uh did what the
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
senator had asked for and put the
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendment in and that's all that does
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
one second because I wanted to look at
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
something here on this
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
Bill yes okay section three got it any
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion on it anybody have
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
any other concerns none not seeing any
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh we'll do a show a hands for the
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
amendment uh all those in
 
02:06:12.079 --> 02:06:15.669 align:start position:0%
amendment uh all those in
favor

02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
unanimous it's open to further Amendment
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
but we have none that's all I was
 
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
checking for was to see if we had a
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
second amendment on that um and although
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of the second amendment I
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
don't have one for that um all right so
