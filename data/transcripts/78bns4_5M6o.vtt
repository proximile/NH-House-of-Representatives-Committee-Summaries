reception in senate education two years

to consolidate and reduce the number of
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%

fishing hunting and various sports
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
as you may know there is an existing
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
legislative use advisory council that
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
advises the governor on issues across
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
state policy
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that council is an impressive group that
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
has done some work on issues related to
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
this new council
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
however the l y ac felt that it could
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
not adequately give needed attention to
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
so it has formally endorsed the creation
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
of this council an important difference
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
for this council is the engagement with
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
state agencies and the
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.709 align:start position:0%
state agencies and the
legislature

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
thus the proposed council is an
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity on many issues
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
as well as a means for developing ideas
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr lupine for introducing the
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill to us and i think it would be
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to accept questions
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee for uh
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay good morning committee members my
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
name is finn graf from barrington new
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i go to dover high school
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
i've come here to urge you to vote ought
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
to pass for sb 263 on behalf of seacoast
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
students for sustainability this bill
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
would establish the new hampshire youth
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
environmental education and conservation
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
council and is incredibly
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
relevant to our organization because of
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
a belief in the value of youth's
 
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
a belief in the value of youth's
perspectives

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
sb 263 is so important because it
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
integrates the voices of young people
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
into legislation this is invaluable in
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
the process of reaching a stable global
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
climate before it is too late a deadline
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
that the union predicts will reach us in
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
11 years
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
but we are not fixed in our predicament
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
an adaptive group of passionate young
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
people such as this is a crucial part of
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the mobilization it will take to solve
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
but this bill has immense value even
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
outside of political action allowing
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
young people to engage in a non-partisan
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
education in science and policy making
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is a widespread interest among new
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire's youth not only in climate
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
change solutions but fish and game
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
regulation outdoor recreation and
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife education this builds this bill
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
allows for these passionate youth to
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
receive a first-hand education in these
 
00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.829 align:start position:0%
receive a first-hand education in these
topics

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
topics
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
we have seen a similar education take
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
place with the useless youth legislative
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
advisory council which has allowed youth
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
committed to public service to engage
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
with the legislation in a way that was
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
previously inaccessible
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire youth environmental
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
education and conservation council would
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
provide a similar opportunity but
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
specifically engineered for youth with a
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
passion for nature
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
this would provide not only a forum for
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
an informed discourse on this topic that
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
many young people such as myself want
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
but also an avenue to unbiased data and
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
research on new hampshire's ecology that
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
most students wouldn't have access to
 
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
most students wouldn't have access to
otherwise

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
while some are nervous that too much
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
youth involvement in governance would go
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
south because of the because of the
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
impulsivity or the inexperience often
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
attributed to young people i believe
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
that this urgency would only ensure that
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
every variable contributing to a
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
decision is considered and weighed
 
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
decision is considered and weighed
correctly

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
taking new hampshire's youth into
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
account when policy making decisions is
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
vital to preserving our ideal of a
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
governing body that is truly
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative of the governed beyond
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
politics beyond education young people
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
have watched enough decisions made
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
without at least having their voices
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
heard the youth of this state those who
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
will inherit the consequences of the
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
decisions made here should be part of
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
determining the future instead of
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
watching it taken out of our hands i
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
will not take any questions
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%

about the lack of optimism for the
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
future that many young people have today
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
um do you think something like this
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
would help
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
empower more of them to
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
be more proactive and trying to create a
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
different future
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
yeah i think um
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
official avenues for people to take
 
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.030 align:start position:0%
official avenues for people to take
action

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
for causes that they really believe in
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
would increase optimism
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
for just generally because
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
if you're working towards something it
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
feels like it's like reach you can reach
 
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
feels like it's like reach you can reach
it

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what dover has but i'm
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
going gonna ask you does dover have a
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
member of
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the youth on the school board
 
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
the youth on the school board
uh

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh
i

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.150 align:start position:0%
don't think so
okay

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
portsmouth does and i know that
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the groups
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
like yourself eco sustainability
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
have many times come to the
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
city council
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
and talk to the city council and become
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
involved in political action so
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm asking is
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
do you believe that now
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
a road for you to take political action
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
without it becoming
 
00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.509 align:start position:0%
without it becoming
superficial

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
superficial
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
um i think the road exists but i don't
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
think it's accessible to everybody in a
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
way that it should be i think that
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
making it accessible like very clearly
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
and very officially would be a better
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
course of action just because then
 
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.230 align:start position:0%
course of action just because then
people

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
have a very clear way to get involved
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
and make differences or at least educate
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
themselves on the process of policy
 
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:44.629 align:start position:0%
themselves on the process of policy
making

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
further questions for this young man
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you finn
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
um i my question is around if you're
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
working in sustainability whether you
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
have any familiar
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the term place
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
attachment because
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking of in terms of
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
the request for this council
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
is that it would provide an inroad for
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
youth to become engaged in state
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
policies around the sustainability of
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
our forests
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
um in our you know our open spaces and
 
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
um in our you know our open spaces and
um

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
and what place attachment actually
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
refers to and it's a relatively new
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
thing so folks that are studying
 
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.470 align:start position:0%
thing so folks that are studying
conservation

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
at the at the act you know at the senior
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
level at college level
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
is about the fact that many youth are
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
not connected to nature and therefore
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
are not engaged
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
in its preservation they don't really un
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
they don't understand it because they
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a connection and when i look
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
at this bill
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i think of i think wow this
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be a formal way for us to engage
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
youth who are even peripherally
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
interested and that way
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
it would help us with our sustainability
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
efforts so
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
in your work do you see that there is um
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
that formal ways for people to get
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
connected with the outdoors
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and its preservation are lacking
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
that there's not enough places for young
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
people to be involved i would say
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely um in my experience just like
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know doing cleanups and trying to
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
organize things like that
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
people are less likely to get involved
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
just because they're not
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
very ex they don't
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
they have not engaged with nature from
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
like a young age and so they don't
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily care as much about it and
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get people to um
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
have an interest in that later on
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
especially just in high school when you
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of other things going on and
 
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
have a lot of other things going on and
yeah

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i i just thought i'd ask you about
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that point because i think that that is
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
where this fits as far as um
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you're not
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
teaching people
 
00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:00.549 align:start position:0%
teaching people
um

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
what different aspects of their
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
their state they can be involved with
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
and showing them
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know places that they might care
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
about if they knew more about it if we
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a place for that then it
 
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
don't have a place for that then it
doesn't

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't work is there a follow-up
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't work is there a follow-up
question

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas has a question
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
question i'd like to get questioning
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
back to the essence of the bill
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
not anything else
 
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
not anything else
um

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.470 align:start position:0%
um
in

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
the bills uh statement on who should be
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
i see there is a very wide um
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
age difference between um the lowest to
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so i would like your opinion if this
 
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.190 align:start position:0%
and so i would like your opinion if this
bill

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.470 align:start position:0%
bill
is

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to establish a council with such a
 
00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.909 align:start position:0%
going to establish a council with such a
wide

00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
wide
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
age disparity that there could be either
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
common ground or
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
an issue with how say your 12 year old
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
might be interacting with a university
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
student on that council
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
do you think the bill
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh has the appropriate type of people
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
that will be on this council or do you
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
feel that there might be some tweaking
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
that that could happen to it
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
i think that that is a fair criticism um
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think maybe the age range is more
 
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
i think maybe the age range is more
about

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
engaging young people like on the lower
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
spectrum with nature and then as they
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
get older within that system they become
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
like the college age students who are
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
actually making
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
organizational decisions like
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
participating in conservation or
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
education on a high level and so i don't
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
think the age range is
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
wrong or maybe
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think the age range is a problem
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity in which different ages
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
would participate and what they get from
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
the organization would be very different
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
could you let us know uh are you a high
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
school student or yeah i'm a junior at
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
dover high great thank you
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you um
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
just because i was very much involved in
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
scouting i wonder if that still plays a
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
role among a lot of young people today
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
because when it comes to outdoors and
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
feeling confident being outdoors and
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
doing projects and so forth
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
that seems to be an empowering thing to
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
do in the past
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
um in my personal experience scouting
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
has been a really good way to engage
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
people with nature but unfortunately it
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
has kind of fallen
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
out of fashion with young people i think
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
parents are also less interested in
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
enrolling their children in scouts but i
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
think you know if there was a way to
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
get more interest in that that would be
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
very good for engagement in nature and
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
also like a
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
i guess not
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
the young man
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank you very very much for
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
coming to see us this morning thank you
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
and now we get to hear from
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
another young person laura lay godfrey
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
who is here to represent
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
herself and the legislative youth
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
so welcome
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
nice to have you here
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody my name is laura
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
godfrey and i'm 17 years old from
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
portsmouth new hampshire
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
i am also the youth co-chair of the new
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislative youth advisory
 
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.549 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislative youth advisory
council

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is a statutory committee made up
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
of youth all across the state with
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
varying political beliefs
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
advise policy
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the state legislature so i'm going to
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
start off by reading two shorter
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
versions of statements written by the
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
legislative council and then one room by
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
myself and i have also emailed the
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee my statements for reference as
 
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
committee my statements for reference as
well

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
so the new hampshire legislative youth
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
advisory council has voted to support
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 263 an act establishing the
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire youth environmental
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
education and conservation council
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
having youth voices on environmental
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is incredibly important
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
because young people will be
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
significantly affected by the
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
environment in years to come
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
despite environmental legislation
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affecting youth
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes young people are shut out of
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversations on the environment as many
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
are too young to vote or run for office
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
and this council would be a necessary
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
tool as it gives a space for youth
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
voices to be heard on an issue that
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
directly affects their futures
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
although the new hampshire legislative
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
youth advisory council already spends
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
time advising on environmental
 
00:23:57.919 --> 00:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
time advising on environmental
legislation

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is a need for a council that can
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
dedicate all of its time towards these
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
discussions rather than the sliver of
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
time that the legislative council can
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
currently dedicate it would also discuss
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
more issues than just environmental
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
policy ranging from outdoor recreation
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
to scientific research as well as
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
educational curriculums
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
the section of the bill that requires a
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
person to be a member of both councils
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
bridges the gap because it is important
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
as having a member of the legislative
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
council an already established group can
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
help to guide the new youth
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
environmental council towards running
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
smoothly and further having a link
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
between the two councils can help the
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
groups collaborate and combine their
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
work to further the impact of youth
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
voices on environmental issues and for
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
these reasons the new hampshire
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
supports that you vote ought to pass on
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
the amended version of senate bill 263
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
now as for my personal statement
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start off again by thanking
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
all of you for listening to me
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
and begin by saying that new hampshire
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
youth are the ones who are going to
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
inherit the environmental legacy that
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
you leave behind
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
and since this is the case they deserve
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have their opinions
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
taken seriously
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
for our political system to be
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative all members of our
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
society must be included in the
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
decision-making process and when young
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
people are disenfranchised or disengaged
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
from government processes a significant
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
portion of our population has little or
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
no voice in decisions that impact their
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
water their air or their school
 
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
water their air or their school
curriculum

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
and it is essential that new hampshire
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
youth have the necessary knowledge and
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
capacity to participate in government at
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
all levels because as youth becomes
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in their communities they
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
bring perspectives that can lead to
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
better decisions and more productive
 
00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
better decisions and more productive
action

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
and only youth are the ones who can tell
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
you how effective a sustainability
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum is or whether the policies
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
you make today will hurt them tomorrow
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
this council has the potential to
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
establish capable and civically engaged
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
leaders that can improve policies
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
not only would this council address a
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental political and democratic
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
right it's also crucial to developing
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
stable policies that respond to the
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
specific needs of younger generations
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
right now as i mentioned earlier i serve
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
as the youth co-chair of another
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
statutory committee created by our state
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
government the legislative council and
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
our members are geographically and
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
politically diverse citizens of new
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire of all ages and for the first
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
time our members feel as if they have a
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
voice that will be listened to in
 
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
voice that will be listened to in
government

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
furthermore they become educated on the
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
accessibility of our government and how
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
they can make an impact on their
 
00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.310 align:start position:0%
they can make an impact on their
communities

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
i want to personally attest to the
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
impact that this council or the
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislative council has had on my life
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
joining it changed my life for the
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
better because as a teenager who often
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
felt powerless when it came to political
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
action i learned how to express myself
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
and make a difference i've been exposed
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
to our state legislature in a way i
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
never would have had with any other
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
extracurricular and i've learned how to
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
collaborate with legislators government
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
staff and peers with varied political
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
beliefs i've become a more well-rounded
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
and more well-informed citizen who is
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
eager to participate in the democratic
 
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.269 align:start position:0%
eager to participate in the democratic
process

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
and voting this bill as ought to pass
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
will only secure the leaders of tomorrow
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
as granite staters
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
while the legislative youth advisory
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
council's focus is narrowed to
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislation this environmental council's
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
reach includes state agencies advocacy
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
groups scientists and more they can make
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations on environmental
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
education and outdoor recreation
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
programs or concerning new hampshire
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
land conservation and this gives youth
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
unbridled access to have a say in
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment they will
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
grow up in
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
there is a need for this council and the
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
youth growing up in new hampshire are
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
the ones who must carry on the torch of
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
our current environmental policy and it
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
is only essential that they be given the
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to educate themselves learn
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
from today's leaders and have a voice in
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
our state government and for the sake of
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
representing youth and enabling our
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
future leaders to protect our future i
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote ought to pass on the
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
amended version of senate bill 263 thank
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
you and i will take any questions
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for that
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
and congratulations on your public
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
speaking skills there thank you they are
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
excellent very very well honed
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure we have a few questions
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee members would like to
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
ask i would like to ask
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you could give us some perspective as
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
a member of the youth advisory council
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
about the age range on your council
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
versus the age range specified in this
 
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
versus the age range specified in this
bill

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
and also the list of activities that
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
this council would undertake versus the
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
activities that the council you
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
currently serve on yeah does
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
so in comparison with the age range i
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
believe our council is 15 to 22 and i
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
think this council is 12-22 so it does
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
allow a little bit more room for middle
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
school in the uh middle school-aged
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
individuals to participate i can attest
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
that our council has been very
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
successful with the varied age range
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
because 15-22 allows high schoolers to
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
learn how to interact with our college
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
student members and it actually allows
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
for a lot of productive conversation in
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
a way for people to
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
interact with knowledge or ideas that
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
they're not typically familiar with and
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
it helps having you know a system of
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
established leadership that allows them
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
to participate and collaborate
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
to participate and collaborate
effectively

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that why that would be
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
any different with a 12 to 22 age range
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
as i think it would actually make it
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
more representative for younger people
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know just trying to get into
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
government or learn more about their
 
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.789 align:start position:0%
government or learn more about their
environment

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
and then as to the second part of your
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
question what was again i apologize
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the difference between the youth
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
advisory council and what this council
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
would do yes so our legislative council
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
as it says in the name focuses
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
exclusively on legislation for the
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
current session but this environmental
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
council would be able to meet with state
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
agencies meet with scientists meet with
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
researchers and help develop educational
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum that directly impacts them uh
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
it also can be involved with you know
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
agencies that help work towards
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
conservation or sustainability in in
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
terms of our forests or our land so it
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
has a much wider reach on the entire
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
continent enviro of the environment in
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire beyond just policy
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has a question
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
so your
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
very well spoken thank you very much
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
your comments involving the democratic
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
process and having a voice
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and his viewpoints uh opens the door for
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
me to ask you this question involving
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
the committee so
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
or the council i should say
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
would you advocate vigorously
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
for when there the selection is made for
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
students to be on this council would you
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
vigorously advocate for for there be a
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
balance between students with opposing
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
points of views
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
um on on this council so so that there
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
could be discussions of pros and cons
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think that's actually part
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
of the reason why
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
the legislative council has been so
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
effective this past year is we have had
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
varying viewpoints and that allows for a
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion a lot of of
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
consideration of other viewpoints and
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes that leads people to change
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
their minds and other times it
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
makes them stick to their opinion all
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
the more resolutely but ultimately it
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
ensures that all the members are more
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
educated and it creates a pattern of
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
civil discourse that i feel can often
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
feel is not seen in today's modern
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
political sphere
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you excellent anybody else have a
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
question as opposed to making a speech
 
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh my question to you and is part of
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
this council and it's part of it is
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
personal do you belong to the portsmouth
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
eco club uh no i do not but i am also a
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
part of the ceco students for
 
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
part of the ceco students for
sustainability

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
i think i may have seen you on a
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
portsmouth blue ribbon sustainability
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee meeting a while back
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there is a place for
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
youth and that youth is
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.350 align:start position:0%
listened to
now

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
if you reach out
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying that i'm gonna qualify
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
why i'm saying that and that's not a
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
speech it's because i have been here for
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
many years and have not been reached
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
no one has reached out to me on
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
environmental issues
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
except members of the eagle club and
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the local schools are active and the
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
school board member so i
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is this council absolutely
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
necessary or is it better to go on a
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
local level
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh that is a great question i agree that
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
there is definitely a lot of local
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
engagement but like you said you only uh
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
you feel is there an avenue for you to
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
have voices if they reach out many
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
individuals especially my peers do not
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
know how to reach out to our state
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
government especially on issues of their
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
educational curriculum and how that
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
impacts how it's impacted on the state
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
basis so i actually find this council
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
essential in the state level because it
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
will broaden their perspectives to not
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
just how to engage with state government
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
like i remember the first time i learned
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
what an lsr was
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
but also gives them access to state
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
agencies and scientific research
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
resources they wouldn't have had
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes i wanted to ask as i look over the
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill and i see it's a
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
set to be like a quarterly meeting and
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
um a fairly broad mandate that you can
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
interact with all levels of government
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask you if you saw this as a
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
as a pipeline of sorts where
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
the inputs would be information that
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps we don't have time to get to
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
here you may be able to take a deeper
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
look and then the pipeline would be that
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
you would be making those
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations directly to lawmakers
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
and others who could in effect create
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
the change that you seek yes uh exactly
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that the legislative
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
council tries to do
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
but given the wide swath of you know
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
issues and bills that it tackles it
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the same time to focus on
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
specifically environmental issues that
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
impact them so i agree it could be a
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
good pipeline to ensure that youth have
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
a direct voice on environmental policy
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
specifically thank you
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'm wondering
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
about the logistics of this and with the
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislative council we've got people
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
coming from all over the state how hard
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
is it for people to get to those
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
meetings particularly the younger people
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
who don't drive
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh that is actually a great question so
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
something that is actually been passed
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
by both the house and senate this past
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
year is an option to allow us to meet
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
virtually and that is only because our
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
council meets uh once a month instead of
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
quarterly so that is meant as an option
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
to give our council members increased
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
access to meet either in person or
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
through a virtual option and it could be
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
something that could be explored by this
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee but i think uh having
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
expectation of quarterly meetings uh
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
should give members enough time to you
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
know get to concord or the state house
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative berezini has a question
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question i noticed that uh the
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
the council is made up of middle
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
schoolers high schools university
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
students and i was wondering um if uh
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers would also be included
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not too certain i think that the
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill should try i should clarify that um
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
i actually used to be an online charter
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
school student
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that did create a lot of like
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
logistical issues when you typically you
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
know try to apply for certain activities
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
they say you have to be you know in a
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
public high school but i definitely feel
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
like this bill should account for that
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe senator waters can also
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just briefly uh
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
following up on what chairman villa's
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
question was um can you just underscore
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
for me how this new council would be
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
complementary to your council i think
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so i i think there are
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
two ways in which that happens firstly
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill text there is a member
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
specifically appointed from the
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislative council to be on this
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
environmental council so that ensures
 
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.670 align:start position:0%
environmental council so that ensures
that

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
that
a

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
member the research and the knowledge
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
that this environmental council gains
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
can also be extended to the legislative
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
council so that ultimately it's youth
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
helping make a difference for youth and
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
all everybody involved in the process
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
can make more informed decisions and
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
then secondly it also goes back to the
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
idea that they will you know research
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
more expanded uh resources and narrow in
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
i have one additional question for you
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'd love to get your perspective on this
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
the council envisioned by this bill
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
focuses exclusively on
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
public sector
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
organizations the legislature state
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
agencies etc
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
is there a similar organization that
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on private sector
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and provides information
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
or advice to them that you're aware of
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh not that i'm aware of off the top of
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
my head unfortunately but thank you for
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.150 align:start position:0%
your question
okay

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
see no further questions we would like
 
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.030 align:start position:0%
see no further questions we would like
to

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%

and i have one final speaker on this
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill and that is represented
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
state senator david waters
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%

are any follow-up questions i'll just
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
say from what i heard that um you know i
 
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
say from what i heard that um you know i
had

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
i meant any student
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh charter
 
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.069 align:start position:0%
uh charter
private

00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh home school to be eligible
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
both for for this um so
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i also will say that just as a kind
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
of an aside on this i want to
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize that
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know representative ladd and i have
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
improve education particularly through
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
the ctes
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
and through outdoor recreation and
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's why our bills last time
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
put some of this into adequacy
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
we've got the office of outdoor
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
recreation we have
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
the granite alliance and um you know
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
sixteen six six million dollar industry
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the outdoor recreation industry in this
 
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
the outdoor recreation industry in this
state

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i've been concerned
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
across the board about young people who
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
might want to go into careers
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
so there's a to me a lot of this has to
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
do with workforce development if we have
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
this inadequacy now how is it that we're
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to shape our
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
education and give some insights into
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know the kinds of careers that young
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
people could go in
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
related to conservation the environment
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
broadly so um to me
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know kind of looking the wrong view
 
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.589 align:start position:0%
you know kind of looking the wrong view
um

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that this is a
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know the environmental issue is
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
great you know i think that's that's
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
great to learn about and so on but i i
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
think that we have the opportunity
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
because of the changes in in the
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
educational system on outdoor recreation
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
other areas to really let students um
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
see how they might
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
see a career and stay in new hampshire
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
too so sorry for that little additional
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
speech but it's okay representative
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
harrington has a question
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you to my uh
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
question senator i you know reading over
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
the bill i see there's a lot of
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
different things going on here we have
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
memberships we've established in your
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
council we have assigned duties and
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
reports and meetings and so forth i see
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
nothing about funding though where is
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
are these people going to receive
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
mileage when they go back and forth to
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
these meetings uh who writes the reports
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
or is this just all done by the people
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
on their own time and own dollar
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question you know
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
this is pretty boilerplate in terms of
 
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.309 align:start position:0%
this is pretty boilerplate in terms of
how

00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh commission is set up and legislative
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
members get mileage on commissions not
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
the public members so you know there's
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
no legislators on this i'm i'd be happy
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
to others to serve as an advisor in
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
capacity but um and there is no funding
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
involved no and and most commissioners
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any funding for reports so
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know kind of it's a typical
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
commission thank you
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has a question uh
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
my question i
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think you just about answered my
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
question previously but just to be clear
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh legislative representation are there
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
gonna be any uh representation on this
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
council at all because as i read the
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
bill it only allows students between 12
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and 25 to be on the council but it
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about any advisors or or
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
anybody like that
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
so what's your
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
can you clarify it for me please
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and you know if
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
i i just say on the age range on that
 
00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
i i just say on the age range on that
issue

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything in the wisdom the
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee you think maybe ought to be
 
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.790 align:start position:0%
committee you think maybe ought to be
improved

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
improved
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
um i kind of felt that
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislators could certainly and others
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
doe folks too in particular i think
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
would be happy to serve as advisors um
 
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.030 align:start position:0%
would be happy to serve as advisors um
and

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
help in in various ways
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
but i also thought that you know kind of
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
the point of this is to let the students
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
learn what it's like to do the work
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
and have their own leadership here and
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
that puts a responsibility on them to
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
develop leadership and not be able to
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
kind of turn to
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
one of us or an adult um in that in that
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
way so that's why it's there but if you
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know if you feel more comfortable
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
with another kind of
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh age range or
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
or having a legislature a legislator or
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody designated you know the
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner education could designate a
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
member from the um
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
from the department i mean those
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
i can see what you're saying
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the follow-up
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes i actually i agree with you on that
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
i thought it might be good for
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
the council to have
 
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
the council to have
some

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
department or somebody to turn to
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
for advisory like in writing a report
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
who to send things to
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
um maybe certain ways of just some other
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
a person that wouldn't be a voting
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
member but they'd be like an advisor
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
on something like that which i i get
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
your point which is i totally agree with
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh just someone else would turn to that
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
that someone could be thank you
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
useful ideas useful ideas yeah and i do
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
many members of this committee will be
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we are done
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
and it is now 9 44
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
which gives us 16 minutes before the
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
next public hearing
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
does the committee feel
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
about going into exact session for this
 
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.550 align:start position:0%

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%

house bill 256 to refresh your memory
 
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.589 align:start position:0%
house bill 256 to refresh your memory
is

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
feasibility of replacing the site
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.870 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
and

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative oxidant
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
you have a comment i yes i do thank you
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair we have two bills on
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee one is
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
we've been told it's a short-term fix
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the other is a long-term look
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
could i think it would benefit us if we
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
considered those two bills together
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
could we do that and have something
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
simpler um like the one that we said
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday could probably be passed in
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay you think that the bill is too
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
complicated then um
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
not too complicated but i think it would
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from from considering the two
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i see that point but um or
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
is the second one only going to be heard
 
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
is the second one only going to be heard
today

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.390 align:start position:0%
today
um

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
how about senate bill 270
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
would you guys have any appetite for
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
executing that bill
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
establishing a low moderate income
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay there is an aptitude appetite for
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
doing that could i see a show of hands
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
of people who would support
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay given that reality i would like to
 
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
okay given that reality i would like to
now

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
open an executive session on senate bill
 
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
open an executive session on senate bill
270

00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
and recognize
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
judge senate bill 270 to be ought to
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
pass and our clerk
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be putting together the
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
required paperwork here and while she
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
i would open the floor to any discussion
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
anything that we need to say about this
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill before we pass it
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
it essentially fixes the
 
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.750 align:start position:0%
it essentially fixes the
low

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%

community solar program
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
by providing a way for

people who could benefit from the
program

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
or has been described by some people as
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
a technical fix to the existing statute
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
and uh
apparently

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
as the statute exists today it's not
 
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.910 align:start position:0%
as the statute exists today it's not
working

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.870 align:start position:0%
working
and

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's become kind of just sitting there
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
kind of useless
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%

so it's been moved and seconded that we
judge

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 440 fn has
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
since representative thomas and
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative kam brills both serve on
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
the offshore
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
wind commission i think it's appropriate
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
that they make those motions
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative partial did you have a uh
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
a comment about this bill i do in fact
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a concern um there's an amendment
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh
 
00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:39.829 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh
260

00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
260
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
was it 268
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that amendment would seem to be
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
more fitting in a study group like this
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
in a bill that that is setting uh
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
is exerting our state rights to the 200
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
mile limit and uh i mean that seems like
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
a fairly clean bill fairly
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward where a study commission
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
could delve into some of these
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
technologies to a greater degree
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
that are suggested in the amendment okay
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you but uh we're discussing senate
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill 440 right i
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
hoping to be understand before we got
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
into the yesterday
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh sorry you didn't make it okay any
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
further dis uh discussion of this bill
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
representative harrington yeah just to
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
be clear what this does is build it
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
gives us a seat at the table with the
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
feds that we otherwise wouldn't it
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
really isn't dependent on even whether
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire pursues offshore wind or
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else does we know there's going
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
to be offshore wind pursuit in the gulf
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
of maine
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
and the other part of it it allows the
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
puc to approve contracts for purchase of
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
offshore win
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what they do now anybody
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
that wants to uh have a contract uh the
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
utilities bring the contract to the puc
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
they review that they look at the ones
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the utility is not recommending and
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
they approve it so it doesn't really
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
change anything but it gets us that seat
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
at the table so regardless of where we
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
go with when this is necessary
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
great any further discussion of this
 
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
great any further discussion of this

representative mc williams and it's
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%

select board and commissioners

all counties and
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
their interests particularly those with
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
small communities
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
as we have in cheshire county for the
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
record i'm jay kahn
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
from keene
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
and uh representing 15 of 23 towns in
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.710 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
um

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
improvements that were made last year in
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
hp 315
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
were significant and most appreciated i
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
think by our
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh towns and counties
 
01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
uh towns and counties
uh

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
as cheshire county moved to acquire some
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh or or
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
enter into some
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.589 align:start position:0%
 
agreements

01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
they did so
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
in collaboration
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
with the county delegation
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
and the
with

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
the interest of towns trying to be
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
represented in that purchase
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
so when they did the power purchase
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
agreement to
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh provide power to the uh county jail
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
the nursing home
 
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.710 align:start position:0%
the nursing home
uh

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
and other county facilities
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh they did so with the intent that if
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
that pricing was competitive enough
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that they would offer that contract to
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
the towns in the county
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of small towns in
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
their community aggregation just is not
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
going to add up to
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
any kind of mass
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
and so they would be looking to another
 
01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
and so they would be looking to another
contract

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.470 align:start position:0%
contract
to

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
be a partner to
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's what this is attempting to do
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
should a
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
area a county service area which could
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
be a town like roxbury
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
300 people
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
be a part of that service
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
the town could
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
opt to to be an opt-in
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
and then notification would be sent only
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
to those
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
residents of roxbury
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
if they wished to opt in to the
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
community power agreement
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent here the opt out is
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
is a clear uh option as well
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
for towns that might be served so
 
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.710 align:start position:0%
for towns that might be served so
hopefully

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
clear enough uh in the
 
01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:47.990 align:start position:0%
clear enough uh in the
uh

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
amended version that
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
has come over to your committee
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh what the intent is and how this is
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
really a small tweak
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh to the legislation that she was
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you senator do we have questions
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
for senator khan
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
very much senator for taking my question
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i was confused by the language of
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i um reached out to cliff below who
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
was our noted guru and and mentor on all
 
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.190 align:start position:0%
was our noted guru and and mentor on all
things

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
it seems and uh he explained this to me
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
as being a very simple change which
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
means that instead of having to send
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
notices to everyone in the county you
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
only send the notices to those in the
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
affected area so it's a cost saving for
 
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
affected area so it's a cost saving for
towns

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't waste resources
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
do you agree that that's really the
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill i agree thank you so
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
additional questions for senator khan
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
i know you have a lot of questions for
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
mr bilo who's coming up soon
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%

senator
 
01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:09.349 align:start position:0%
senator
um

01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i've got
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
two two short questions that you can
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
answer it seems to me that
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
for small towns that you were mentioning
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
for example um the way they would look
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
to partners would be
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
to some program offered by a county
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
which would be a much bigger entity
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
that they could join is that limited to
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
their county or not
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
and the second question is uh who uh who
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
who will have the listing
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
where does that list come from that they
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for those questions
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the list would
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
come from the town
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
of town residents so it would cover
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the 300
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
people in
 
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.309 align:start position:0%
people in
roxbury

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
no dude off the tax rolls the tax throws
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah not renters or i i believe it could
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
be the property
 
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
be the property
holders

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
holders
 
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
holders
yeah

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up i i you know and i
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm venturing here i'm
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
as i'm reading the bill it says each
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
retail customer so that would mean each
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
person that pays a bill i am assuming
 
01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
person that pays a bill i am assuming
um

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question on the municipalities
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
and counties shall post public notice of
 
01:09:37.759 --> 01:09:39.189 align:start position:0%
and counties shall post public notice of
aggregation

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
i sometimes have a problem with that
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
public notice because
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
i know that's a 91a issue but in some
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
counties that's on the door of the
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
men's room and ladies room in the county
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
building and nobody goes in there
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
because it's locked three quarters of
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i i don't understand that the mailing
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
but i i would hope that we could make a
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarification such as all
 
01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarification such as all
media

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
media
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
um all available media and would you
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
approve of that i would thank you
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
khan um i guess
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused on the opt-in
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
opt-out what
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
where do they when has it dropped out
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm uncertain
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we both know what the meaning of
 
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.630 align:start position:0%
i mean we both know what the meaning of
the

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
terms are uh but i'm not sure who is
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
making that determination is it the
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
county and its
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
county and its
uh

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
proposal to
 
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.470 align:start position:0%
proposal to
its

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
relevant towns i or the town itself i
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which way that
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
that negotiation
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
is initiated
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
our next speaker will be able to answer
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i think so yes and and relative to
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative samson's uh uh
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
your other question i i i
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
how would it be aggregated i
 
01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
how would it be aggregated i
uh

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i think uh
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
mr below is
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
community and has a good handle on this
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
um not so much of a question is a
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps more of a comment of what
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
happened in my own town of marlborough
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
where our community came together a town
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and voted on a resolution to uh
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
meeting and voted on a resolution to uh
uh

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to well push forward with being the
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
aggregation and to make it an opt out
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
situation because what we would actually
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
be doing would be offering lower utility
 
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.669 align:start position:0%
be doing would be offering lower utility
rates

01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
of course we will be communication with
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
all of the people who are producing who
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
are getting a bill in our town so it was
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
thought to be redundant also to the
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
second mailing as well uh we're a poor
 
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
second mailing as well uh we're a poor
town

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
we like to keep our money close to us
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
it was just a matter of cost to make it
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment usually
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
we ask questions but i am so sorry but i
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
gave you a little attitude here yeah i
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine has another
 
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine has another
question

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
shot yourself a note as soon as okay
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much mr chair i did
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
drop myself a note and that jogged my
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
mind uh the suggestion was made of an
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to say all available media
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
again for small towns that could be an
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of money um
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
would you think it would be appropriate
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
if we were to say
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
two to three
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
major media
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know one
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
social media one newspaper
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
one online uh i think all available
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
media particularly in small towns that
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
are close to cities
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
where they would be required to put it
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the manchester guardian and they
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
would be required to put it in all sorts
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
of different places uh
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
could could you give us some guidance on
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
your view on that
 
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
your view on that
um

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i might weigh in on
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
that but i i really your your best
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
where this ought to be posted i or if
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
there is a county representative here
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
more familiar with
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
their usual postings of
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
information to the public i i i'm just
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
not there thank you very much i i think
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
you've given us a very good uh
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow-up there the guidance
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
is to follow the norm of how
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be informing people
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
when public notices are required yes
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
which isn't all available and in this
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
case a county yeah in this case the
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
county's normal procedures thank you
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
um

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
as someone who is on the portsmouth
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
energy advisory committee and we have
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
voted to participate in the power
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
community coalition
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and i think you can
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
correct me this bill doesn't contradict
 
01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.630 align:start position:0%
correct me this bill doesn't contradict
that

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
the local community can decide whether
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
they want an opt-in or an opt-out and
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think our group is is inclined right
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
now to say we're offering this and we're
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to let everybody opt in who wants
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
to participate in it but you can opt out
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
anytime you don't like it
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't think this bill restricts
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
initiative at the local level to do
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
either one is that correct
 
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
either one is that correct
i

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
am unfamiliar
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's
 
01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:17.830 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's
sounds

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
senator khan we want to thank you
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator for being here i know you have a
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
busy day and you need to give your
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
brother three places at one time thank
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and you know i i just uh
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
want to leave the committee with you
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
know i clearly
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing this forward on behalf of
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
the county
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i i on behalf of the small towns
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
that i represent
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that i i think is
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
important for them and i'm pleased that
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
the counties are interested enough in
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
trying to be the coordinating arm so
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
that each county doesn't have to
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
enter into this and become aware and can
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
rely on the county government to provide
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
that expertise thank you
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on and i will now
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
call to
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%

and in new hampshire he is mr community
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%

mr bilo welcome and thank you uh good
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
the community power coalition of new
 
01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.270 align:start position:0%
the community power coalition of new
hampshire

01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
which uh comp is comprised of um 17
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the county of
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
cheshire um
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
and this as you might recall last year
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
when sin house bill 315 was passed it
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
included a new sentence in another part
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the statute that says a county plan
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
may provide an aggregation program for
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
all or a subset of municipalities within
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
the county that request to participate
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
by majority vote their respective
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
governing bodies so that that sort of
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
sort of set the stage for cheshire
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
county to think about how they want to
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
do this several individual towns within
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
cheshire county have chosen to go their
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
own route with community power
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
the law you know clearly provides that a
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
municipal program takes precedent over a
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
county program
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh but in thinking about their electric
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
as i understand it cheshire county was
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
wanting to serve their own facilities in
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
the first instance and then also offer
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
an opt-in product probably initially
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
just to to primarily to towns for their
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
municipal facilities and potentially to
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
large cni customers that you know wanted
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
to also um
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
buy in on that on an opt-in basis um and
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
then eventually uh possibly expand that
 
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.510 align:start position:0%
then eventually uh possibly expand that
to

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
serving towns that might want to do
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
this either on an opt-in or opt-out
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
basis the law allows each municipality
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
or county to decide whether to offer
 
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.870 align:start position:0%
or county to decide whether to offer
services

01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
well the basic default
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
energy service on an opt-out or an
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
opt-in basis um
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
but then you know the problem that has
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
been sort of daunting them while they
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
haven't completed their aggregation plan
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
is the thought of having to mail to
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
every single
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
retail electric customer within the
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
entire county
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know excluding those municipalities
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
that that have programs or planning
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
programs um it just made it infeasible
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
for them to even consider doing this for
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
for just county buildings and municipal
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
and school district facilities so
 
01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
and school district facilities so
um

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.310 align:start position:0%
um
they

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
this sort of came up in working on rules
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
last uh june with with what was then uh
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
puc staff and and eversource
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the observation is that the current
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
language and statute that starts at line
 
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.990 align:start position:0%
language and statute that starts at line
three

01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
says if a plan is adopted or once
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
adopted is revised to include an opt-out
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
alternative default service
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the municipality county shall mail writ
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
notification to each retail electric
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
customer within the municipality or
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.510 align:start position:0%
customer within the municipality or
county

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
that the feeling was that could be read
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
two ways that if it's an opt-out program
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
then you have to do the
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
notification to everyone or
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
if the plan is adopted
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
it you have to do a mailing to every
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
retail electric customer
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
and um you know the cost of a mailing
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
between postage and printing and you
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
know processing is probably well in
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
excess of a dollar
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
per customer
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
and uh for what they wanted to do it
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
just it just
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
made it
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
look infeasible so
 
01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.790 align:start position:0%
look infeasible so
um

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
the the thought was uh
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify um first of all that's the
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
new words in line five um
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
to clarify that uh within a county
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
service area where such opt-out service
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
is to be provided that would require
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
notification to every electric customer
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
but if a program or other service is
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
just offered on an opt-in basis
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
meaning that a customer would have to
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
affirmatively say i want to be enrolled
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
in this program
 
01:20:20.159 --> 01:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
in this program
then

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
at lines
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
7 and 8 says that
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
mailing of written notification to each
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
customer within the municipality or
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
county service area shall not be
 
01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
county service area shall not be
required

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh so it's just sort of a logical thing
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
that if something's just offered
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
somebody has to affirmatively decide to
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
to join the program
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you not don't have to do a mailing
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
to absolutely everyone the senate did um
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
amend it to add the municipalities and
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
county she'll post public notice of
 
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
aggregation programs um
 
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.990 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
and that it was just just a feeling i
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
mean that you know certainly that would
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
be an expectation anyways the the
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
electric aggregation plan itself has to
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
be publicized there has to be a public
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on it um
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
and that requires public notice as well
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh but this is just sort of a belt and
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
suspenders edition i would suggest that
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
i every county and i think virtually
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
every municipality has a website so you
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
might want to say
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
if if you want to add to that she'll
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
post public notice of aggregation
 
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
post public notice of aggregation
programs

01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the same manner that meetings are
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
noticed but but shall include you know
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
notice on on the uh
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
municipality or county's website some
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
gets it on to their website because i
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
think that's where most people tend to
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
look these days
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
but there would also be the regular
 
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
but there would also be the regular
notification

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing process that's
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
required in other parts of the statute
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that that's the basic
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
information i wanted to share with the
 
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.790 align:start position:0%
information i wanted to share with the
committee

01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you very much for uh
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying all that for us this language
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
looks familiar to me is this language
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we considered adding to hb 315
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
no but there is that parallel language
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we added that's in 53 e6
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
that says a county may provide
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
a program for all or subset of
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities within the county that
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
request to participate by majority vote
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
respective governing bodies that that
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
language was added i don't think we
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
really thought about this issue
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
um because this part of the uh this this
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
is language that's carried forward from
 
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.669 align:start position:0%
is language that's carried forward from
um

01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:37.430 align:start position:0%
um
1996

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
1996
 
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
1996
um

01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know that that written notification
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
every retail electric customer was was
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the law from that point and i might
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
add that in response to another question
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
that was asked at line nine
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh through line 13 it talks about to um
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
allow that mailing to occur um the
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
utilities have to provide the name and
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
mailing address of all their electric
 
01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
mailing address of all their electric
customers

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.669 align:start position:0%
customers
um

01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:02.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's that is something of a burden
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
particularly it's it's apparently it's
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
not too hard on a municipal basis but
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
that having to do it for a whole county
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
with a lot of a lot of small towns
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they have to get it cheshire
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
county's served by at least two
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
different electric utilities three
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually liberty eversource and the
 
01:23:20.639 --> 01:23:22.790 align:start position:0%
actually liberty eversource and the
co-op

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
so if you're just doing an opt-in
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
program that you're looking maybe for a
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
handful of municipalities to sign up in
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
school districts to sign up their
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
facilities for
 
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.950 align:start position:0%
facilities for
um

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's a little
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome to ask the utilities also to
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
produce those mailing lists when you're
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
not actually
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know targeting that those groups of
 
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
you know targeting that those groups of
people

01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
01:23:44.639 --> 01:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
cliff thank you for taking the question
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
why can't each
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
participating municipality
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
do their own
 
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.310 align:start position:0%
do their own
mailing

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
mailing
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
many i i don't i'm not that familiar
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
with cheshire county
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i know that we have a lot of people
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
maybe part-time residents in some places
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
and that mailing is really the only way
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
that they're going to know what's going
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
on so why can't each
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
municipality within the county that is
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
participating do the mailing and not
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
i and just a thought yeah
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
if a municipality wants to do their own
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
aggregation program then they would do
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the mailing or arrange for a third party
 
01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
to do the mailing um
 
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
to do the mailing um
[Music]

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know this law simply has always
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
provided that this could also be done on
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
a county-wide basis the big change last
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
year was that it could be just those
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
towns that want to participate and even
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
that contemplated that it might be a
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
town that says okay we
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
we want you to serve our whole community
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
on an opt-out basis so then you would do
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
the mailing to everyone in that
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
service area where where opt-out
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
services to be provided so everybody
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
would get that mailing plus there has to
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
be public hearing with public
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
notification um through the usual means
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
even on an opt-in basis there still has
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
to be a public hearing on the proposed
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan that would describe the
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
intent to do it on an opt-in basis
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
so there would be multiple
 
01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
so there would be multiple
notifications

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.270 align:start position:0%
follow-up
i

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression that in
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
discussions that we had
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
with community power
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
that opt out
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
was the preferable way so that you would
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
increase your
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
customer base is that a correct
 
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
customer base is that a correct
um

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that opt-out based
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
programs you know assuming they launch
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
in every plane that's being written that
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
i know so far says we're only going to
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
launch if we can offer lower rates than
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
the utility default service rates um
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
although they may not always be lower
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
but but
 
01:26:10.239 --> 01:26:10.950 align:start position:0%
but but
uh

01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
that you know the intent is that on on
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
average you could meet or beat the
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
utility default service price um if
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh if that was the um
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
case that
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know typically there's a very high
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
retention rate that you know 90 95 of
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
customers will
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
come over on an opt-out basis
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of experience
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
with opt-in but i think the few
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
instances where it's occurred
 
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.709 align:start position:0%
instances where it's occurred
uh

01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know you might get five percent or
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
ten percent of of customers opting in
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
and and you know the basis for this is
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
this this only happens if the governing
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
body and then the legislative body of
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
the municipality um votes to to go this
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
route and it is and in all cases that
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know we built in working with this
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee built in a lot of provisions
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
within the statute that says you can't
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to uh revert back to the
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
utility default service you know the
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
price goes up after six months and they
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
say no i want to go back if they're free
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
to do so no you they can't be charged
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
for that as long as they do it on a
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
regular meter reading cycle you know
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
next meter reading um
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
it it will make it very easy for a
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
customer who doesn't want to be part of
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
the program if it's an opt-out
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to to go back to the utility default
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
service or a different competitive
 
01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
service or a different competitive
supplier

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
tom thank you
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you uh cliff
 
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you uh cliff
um

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what uh uh
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
represent kelly pitts's
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
concern was
 
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
concern was
um

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's no nothing in this bill that
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the municipality or the
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
entity from doing a mailing if they so
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
choose to do so sure i know that in
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth now the our energy advisory
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee we're going to do a big pr
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing to let people know about what's
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
and if that's what's required to get
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
people on the notice they need that they
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
have this option
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's we're going to do but on the
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
other hand i can see that in some cases
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
that might be too expensive for some
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
entities and they're going to have to
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
publicize it in a different way but this
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
bill would not prohibit any mailing if
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
mr bilo
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
well seeing none
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a fairly uh simple and
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill and so uh
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
we've learned everything we need to
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
learn about it i guess so
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
blue sheet nick can you let us know how
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh folks out there are perceiving this
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill yep so online we had 72 in favor uh
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh to in in support signed up here in
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
the in the committee room okay for sure
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you i just
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
have a question um
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative white
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
i i'm just curious on the online
 
01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:41.189 align:start position:0%
i i'm just curious on the online
information

01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
does it indicate
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes running through it
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
it looks like all of them
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
just a quick glance looks to be all from
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.709 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
yes

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you or at least that's the towns
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
they put
 
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
they put
okay

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
all right so with that we'll close the
 
01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
265 and i will remind everyone
 
01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
265 and i will remind everyone
that

01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
our next public hearing will commence at
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
12 30
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
not one o'clock
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled that next public
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
hearing for 90 minutes because it's on a
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
very important bill
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
and a bill on which
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
i i suspect a lot of people will want to
 
01:30:30.159 --> 01:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
i i suspect a lot of people will want to
testify

01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
testify
so

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
i just want to alert everybody to that
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
because normally we reconvene after
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
lunch at one o'clock but today it's 12
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.550 align:start position:0%
lunch at one o'clock but today it's 12
30.

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
30.
 
01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.350 align:start position:0%
30.
so

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
that gives us
 
01:30:45.679 --> 01:30:46.629 align:start position:0%
that gives us
either

01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
a lengthy lunch break starting now or an
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do some more exact
 
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do some more exact
sessions

01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
however

01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of members who are
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's look through the list here
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
and see if
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are bills we might have some
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
concerns mr chairman
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
if i could make a representative
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
i i think that sb 259 we had
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
pretty much general
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
agreement in the room when it was
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
discussed and we just we
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually talked about uh
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
the crux of the amendment that
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
i hope to put forward
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
it would not be a surprise to anyone
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's not here and i don't i don't think
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's any partisan divide on this
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
issue that's a
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
forgot to turn on my mic
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's consider doing an exact session on
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
senate bill
424

01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
424
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
which is relative to renewable energy
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
and national natural gas
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
all those who would be in favor of an
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion for
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
oh let me refresh everybody's memory
 
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.550 align:start position:0%
oh let me refresh everybody's memory
then

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424 is relative to renewable
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
energy and natural gas it uh establishes
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
in in law a method to
 
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.550 align:start position:0%
in in law a method to
accept

01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas as a
 
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.430 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas as a
uh

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
form of energy that's
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh acceptable to this in our state so
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
once again
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
we just heard this bill yesterday so it
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
should be fairly
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
fresh in everyone's mind once again if
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of supporting this bill
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i think we can do a uh
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
an exact session here did you have a
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
comment representative callie pitts
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
if we have enough votes i i think i'm
 
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.790 align:start position:0%
if we have enough votes i i think i'm
very

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
perturbed at this if we have enough
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
votes to get it the way
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
we want it then we'll take a vote but if
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough votes to get it the
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
way we want it then we won't
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the people who are here are here but
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
that addressed some technical concerns
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
willing to reconsider the motion on that
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill to adopt the amendment but i don't
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to adopt but could it
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%

quite quickly
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment is 1396 s
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
but i was going to reference the outline
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill as passed by the
 
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill as passed by the
senate

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
i can go with whatever is easier for the
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
i would i would like you to explain what
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
the change is sure so one of one of the
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment there was a
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
reference to uh the eap administered by
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
the commission as the committee is aware
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
there is a bill in the works about
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
transferring the eap
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
over to the department to avoid any
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
potential conflict we just remove the
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
language it says administered by the
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
commission and that's that's rectified
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
the second change um
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the amendment uh allows electric
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities to recover costs
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
we wanted language and we suggested
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
language in there that says all
 
01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.750 align:start position:0%
language in there that says all
reasonable

01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:40.790 align:start position:0%
reasonable
and

01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred costs
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's the second change the third
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
change in the amendment would preserve
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
existing statute to authorize the
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
department to petition the puc to assess
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
fines revoke the registration of
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit from doing business in the
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
state uh for any group host which
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
violates the requirements of the bill
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
those are the three changes
 
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
those are the three changes
okay

01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.629 align:start position:0%
okay
excellent

01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
we did discuss that yesterday we did we
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
have all the changes but it did you say
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
the department is authorized to petition
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right so while
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh kristen
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
gets everybody a copy of the the
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
amendment what we could do now
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
is we could vote to reconsider
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
our earlier
 
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.189 align:start position:0%
our earlier
motion

01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
it'll take some roll calls and some
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork to get all that done and maybe
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
by the time we get that done we'll have
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment and we can
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
consider adopting the amendment
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes you may ask a question
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:49.109 align:start position:0%
yes you may ask a question
procedurally

01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
procedurally
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
now that the bill is in the possession
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the house can the amendment can
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
senator waters make the amendment does
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
that have to be presented by a member of
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
because the amendment was made
 
01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
because the amendment was made
it

01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm assuming the amendment
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
was not voted on in the senate
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
and that is correct it now has to
 
01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
and that is correct it now has to
be

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
presented by someone in the house i do
 
01:39:18.239 --> 01:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
presented by someone in the house i do
believe

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
the way it was explained to me is that
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
if an amendment is made by
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of a bill on the same day as
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is heard in public hearing
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
then it can be accepted from
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
this the
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor an amendment can be
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
can we make a quick call to paul because
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding was once the bill is in
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the house it is in possession of the
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
house and the house is the one that acts
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
on it the senate cannot act on it
 
01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
on it the senate cannot act on it
anymore

01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
correct representative thomas um thank
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
so based on my own experience uh this
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
year uh
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe terminology but someone in the
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
committee here would have to introduce
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
the amendments
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and we vote on it
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
so that's based on my experience this
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
as far as i know the amendment has to
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
carry on the
 
01:40:24.639 --> 01:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
carry on the
um

01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a mensch what can i say
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
help me understand do you want us to
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
call the clerk and ask if an amendment
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
with senator water's name on it can be
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
adopted by the committee is that what
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
you want that is correct
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative thomas would you go make
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%

01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah uh no
 
01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
yeah uh no
oops

01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
oops
 
01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:16.750 align:start position:0%
18-0 okay by a vote of 18 to nothing
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
18-0 okay by a vote of 18 to nothing
[Music]

01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
the motion about to pass on senate bill
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
270 is
 
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.629 align:start position:0%
270 is
defeated

01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
and that restores senate bill 270 to its
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
original pristine
 
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.709 align:start position:0%
original pristine
condition

01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
and makes it amenable to
 
01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
and makes it amenable to
uh

01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
an amendment however it appears that we
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment just yet but
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has some news
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
about that amendment yes um well uh
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
learned something new every day
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh according to the clerk
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
the house cannot
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment with the senate
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
someone here has to take standard
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
water's amendment i'll do it down to ols
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
and get a house amendment number put on
 
01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:03.669 align:start position:0%
and get a house amendment number put on
it

01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
so we can introduce it here it'll be
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
this it'll be the same amendment same
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
wording so you don't have to i think i
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
but we still need the actual
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendment here
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
with the house number on it
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
with a new number right
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
i assume they will because it has to be
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
a house amendment yeah it will have a
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
kristen are you uh raising your hand
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
because you want to take care of this
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay kristen we'll we'll take care of it
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
but given the fact that it's going to
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
take ols at least 15 or 20 minutes to do
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
this uh i think we're just going to have
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
to wait
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and take care of this
 
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:06.709 align:start position:0%
and take care of this
uh

01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:48:08.239 --> 01:48:09.270 align:start position:0%
executive session
later

01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to do it now
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
so let's let's break for lunch now we're
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to do 4 24 or what we're going to
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.199 --> 01:48:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
i thought you objected to that
 
01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
i thought you objected to that
representation

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
you asked me if i if i raised my hand i
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
just said no but
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't object i thought we're going to
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
do score 24.
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay if the consensus is that you're
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
vote on house bill
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
or senate bill 424 then we can do that
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i will recognize
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i move out to pass on 424.
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
my representative can uh recognize
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative cam bruils
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i'd like to second that
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
motion okay it's been moved and seconded
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
judge senate bill 424 as ought to pass
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on this question
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
i know this puts
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
me within the minority with my own
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
caucus even but i am not prepared to
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
vote for a bill
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
that pumps more
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas into our environment i do
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
not consider that a bridge technology
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting no on this
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.709 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
question

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.719 --> 01:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
at this point thank you uh but we are in
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
the comments i
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
would second the uh remarks of uh my
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague uh we did hear
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday from the sierra club
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the air resources council in
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
california had conducted a study and
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
found that there was increased methane
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
from landfills that used this particular
 
01:50:07.119 --> 01:50:08.950 align:start position:0%
from landfills that used this particular
technology

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
another issue we also heard from the
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation that they
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill because of
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
difficulties predominantly with methane
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
leakage issues
 
01:50:20.239 --> 01:50:21.030 align:start position:0%
leakage issues
um

01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i i believe there was also a
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
brief discussion
 
01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
brief discussion
about

01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
using the natural gas on site and
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
transforming it into electricity and
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
then providing the electricity directly
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
into the grid rather than what what is
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually on the table with this bill the
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
reason liberty utility wanted to bring
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it forward is so that they can truck
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
this gas
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
from a landfill to their
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
distribution network
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah and those greenhouse gas
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
emissions also of the transporting of
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
the fuel weren't taken into account and
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
my final concern is about increasing
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
more pipeline infrastructure for natural
 
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
more pipeline infrastructure for natural
gas

01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
gas
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
under the guise that it's going to be
 
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.550 align:start position:0%
under the guise that it's going to be
natural

01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
natural
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i mean renewable natural
 
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.629 align:start position:0%
um i mean renewable natural
gas

01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
gas
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
when um in in fact
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a cap of five
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
percent so it looks to me like just a
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
way to expand
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas pipeline infrastructure in
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we also heard
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday that flaring
 
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.550 align:start position:0%
yesterday that flaring
that

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
that
gas

01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
gas
 
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.189 align:start position:0%
gas
from

01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
can actually
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
cause more emissions than
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
burning it in a in a clean and reliable
 
01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.910 align:start position:0%
burning it in a in a clean and reliable
fashion

01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we also heard yesterday that
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
california is mandating 12 percent
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
of renewable natural gas by 2030.
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are a number of technical issues
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
which may not have been discussed one of
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
which is that in new hampshire i believe
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
that landfill gas is coming out at a
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
slight negative pressure and this
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
business of churning the landfills is a
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat different situation and if
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
they're taking the gas out at negative

pressure i believe they're doing this in
 
01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
pressure i believe they're doing this in
nashua

01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then generating on-site uh not
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
putting it into a pipeline but if that
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
is the case then it actually has to be a
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
net reduction in emissions rather than
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%

i'm not exactly sure of what i heard
 
01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure of what i heard
from

01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham but
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
i have the testimony of clean energy new
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they support 424.
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh there's
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually a couple issues that came up
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
one was had to do with the uh recovery
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
of prudently encored costs
 
01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:03.189 align:start position:0%
of prudently encored costs
related

01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
to uh procuring
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
i i think the key is that it was a
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
may approve and not a shall approve
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that this is a pilot program so i i
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't i think we can let that one slide
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
it it there it may
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
possibly become
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
an issue but it on on the surface i
 
01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
an issue but it on on the surface i
think

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
go with that and the other issue which
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions on
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
the the methane release
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh that is going to happen because of uh
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal of methane from these
 
01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.310 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal of methane from these
landfills

01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
landfills
i

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't think that's
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
something that we should
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
be dealing with in in this committee i
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
think that this has to go before the
 
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.109 align:start position:0%
think that this has to go before the
commission

01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
and that i
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
would hope that they would take all of
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
those things into consideration before
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i think these
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
people had stated this is a coming
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
technology this ironically uh last night
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
i got an email from some group at the
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
bank of america which is holding a
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
conference on renewable natural gas and
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of interest in this
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i think having a pilot program would
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
be wise for us to get ahead of it find
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
out the good the bad and the ugly and
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
see if we want to go forward but having
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
a pilot program would seem to make sense
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
because it is a technology that's being
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
pushed not just here but across the
 
01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:46.550 align:start position:0%
pushed not just here but across the
country

01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
yes i i think we we do need to focus on
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is a pilot project
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
which means i think the timeline
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
involved was maybe three years to look
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh if we don't take some action
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
proactively to look into it
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh we're never gonna get to some kind of
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
good result the the data that the sierra
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
club presented and i haven't read all of
 
01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:16.790 align:start position:0%
club presented and i haven't read all of
it

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
but there are lots of information
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the country about
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
natural gas renewable natural gas and
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the condition under which
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
things are done they could be more
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
negative or more positive
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
however this
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
source here is local indigenous new
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have landfills and this is
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
one way of reaping some benefit from
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
those landfills and it has to be done in
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
an environmentally sensitive way
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the pilot project will
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
will show what the best way to do it is
 
01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:50.709 align:start position:0%
will show what the best way to do it is
um

01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't buy necessarily this idea that
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
more is leaking or or more is flared if
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
you do that i i don't that's very
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
technical that has to be really verified
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
by a lot of organizations a pilot
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
project will do that we heard from
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
clean air new hampshire who supports
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
this we heard from the timberland
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
association that supports this
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
we heard from various people who think
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is worth exploring
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we should allow allow this
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm in agreement that i like the
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
idea of uh homegrown and varied you know
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy sources i i think we should be
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
doing that i think that my exception
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the bill is that although fuel
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
diversity is good and this is a
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
technology that's being explored
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
on the environmental considerations i
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
don't feel like the bill does put guard
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
rails in at the outset
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
even in what it's asking of the public
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
utilities commission it revolves mostly
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
around the economics and whether there's
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
viability or you know whether the
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
burdens are met that it's a value to
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
rate payers but again because no one is
 
01:57:05.679 --> 01:57:06.470 align:start position:0%
rate payers but again because no one is
is

01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly being asked to determine
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a net
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
in you know emissions up or down whether
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
those things are not accounted for in
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
the bill and that's the reason that i
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
have an exception to it i don't have an
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
exception to a pilot i don't have an
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
exception to the idea of trying to
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
figure out if there's a way for us to
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
leverage the landfills um
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
i think i
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think the the person who testified
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday who made the point that why
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
would we do the study after three years
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
because once it's in place for that long
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a harder thing to undo
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh if it does have negative effects i
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
would like to see the bill modified so
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
that it says upfront
 
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.390 align:start position:0%
that it says upfront
um

01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
what we expect in terms of
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts rather than
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
saying somebody down the line is going
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
to figure that out and it will be to the
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
benefit of the customer
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxenam
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for giving
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to correct my earlier
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
statement uh representative callie pitts
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
is absolutely right i misspoke uh if
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
cenh did support the bill it was the
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation which was
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
the one that opposed the bill and in the
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
testimony of mr krakow uh for clf he
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
also spoke about the need for guard
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
rails and the fact that we're not we're
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
making no effort to determine what the
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
leakage is at the before we initiate so
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
we will have no baseline from which to
 
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.390 align:start position:0%
we will have no baseline from which to
measure

measure
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
this this is not a scientific approach
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%

uh senate bill 577 and i think uh
 
03:33:51.190 --> 03:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
looking for representative thomas was
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
there he is instrumental in helping uh
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
get that filled through this committee
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
the way that the public utilities
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
commission interpreted that legislation
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
with the what's called the cumulative
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
being suspended and accumulating and
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
then having to be repaid immediately
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
is causing or will cause a major problem
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
for burgess
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
when that bill comes due and the problem
 
03:34:30.399 --> 03:34:31.750 align:start position:0%
when that bill comes due and the problem
that

03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
burgess and they will be here to testify
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
has said it it is very likely that the
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
plant will
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
shut down
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
as you've heard me say on numerous
 
03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
as you've heard me say on numerous
occasions

03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
03:34:46.800 --> 03:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
before this committee
having

03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
75 megawatts
 
03:34:49.920 --> 03:34:51.190 align:start position:0%
75 megawatts
of

03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:34:54.429 --> 03:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
24 7 base load power
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
365 days a year that is renewable
 
03:34:58.880 --> 03:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
365 days a year that is renewable
and

03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
far better than burning some of the
 
03:35:05.190 --> 03:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
other types of hydrocarbon-based fuels
 
03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:06.550 align:start position:0%
other types of hydrocarbon-based fuels
that

03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
get burned in new hampshire for energy
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
it suits our
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
not only renewable but
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
forest-based fuel
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard me talk
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
many times about the jobs impact
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think there will be people from berlin
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
today and i know there's a letter that
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
was sent to the city uh to the senate
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
from uh the mayor of berlin and i'm
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that letter has gotten to you folks too
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the particular impact that this
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
plant has
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the city of berlin
 
03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill seeks to do
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
starting on line 19 the first findings
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
section talk about how we got to the
 
03:35:55.190 --> 03:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
point that we got to the importance of
 
03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:56.070 align:start position:0%
point that we got to the importance of
the

03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:58.389 --> 03:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
um bill on the forest products industry
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
but then on line 19 starting on line
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
line 19 non-withstanding the prior
 
03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:06.550 align:start position:0%
line 19 non-withstanding the prior
orders

03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
orders
 
03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
shall open a docket to amend any of its
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
orders as necessary to protect the
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
continued operation of the burgess
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
power plant
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
i think it is safe to say that when
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 577 passed several years ago
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
there was an expectation
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
that that was a bridge to the future
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
but not meant as a cliff that once we
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
got to that point um through the way
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
that the settlement was structured at
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
the puc
that

03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
would lead to a shutdown of this power
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
plant at that point in time but that's
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
what we're facing
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
um that is what this bill would help to
 
03:36:50.080 --> 03:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
um that is what this bill would help to
alleviate

03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
you'll hear
 
03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:55.710 align:start position:0%
you'll hear
um

03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:55.720 --> 03:36:57.429 align:start position:0%
um

[Music]
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
discussion i think from several of the
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
participants here about what it means
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
not only to berlin but on a statewide
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
basis it's about 70 million dollars
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's generated
 
03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
that's generated
annually

03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
annually
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
it has about it's responsible for about
 
03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:15.349 align:start position:0%
it has about it's responsible for about
240

03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
240
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
um jobs
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's critically important because it's
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
along with the
 
03:37:26.780 --> 03:37:26.790 align:start position:0%

um the last of the biomass plants
operating

03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
operating
 
03:37:35.359 --> 03:37:36.229 align:start position:0%
operating
and

03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
critically important for the low-grade
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
wood forest products industry if this
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
plant goes away that would be a
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
devastating impact i think this
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee has heard that testimony um in
 
03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to it i
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
um fully am aware of that cost
 
03:37:59.429 --> 03:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that um
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill gets passed and signed into
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
law by pushing it back to the public
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
utilities commission with a specific
 
03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:08.790 align:start position:0%
utilities commission with a specific
criteria

03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill to keep the plant
 
03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill to keep the plant
open

03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
open
 
03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
open
that

03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
that will help
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and keep the plant
 
03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:19.830 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and keep the plant
operating

03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
operating
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
one thing that
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
i hope will come out in the testimony
 
03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
this plant
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
over the last year since they've opened
 
03:38:33.189 --> 03:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
their books for scrutiny which hasn't
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the past is nearly at a
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
break-even point because of higher
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
energy costs
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i i would hope that moving forward
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
the puc if this bill passes we're able
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
to take that into account
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
and able to restructure an agreement on
 
03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
and able to restructure an agreement on
between

03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
burgess eversource and the commission
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
protects ratepayers obviously but also
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
keeps this plant um operating so at that
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
point mr chairman happy to try to answer
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions but i think some of the more
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
technical questions
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
probably better addressed to the folks
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
here from burgess
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley an excellent
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
introduction to this bill you mentioned
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
577 was conceived to be a bridge to the
 
03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:25.590 align:start position:0%
577 was conceived to be a bridge to the
future

03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious to know
 
03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:28.389 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious to know
if

03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed and the puc
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
essentially forgave the 58 million
 
03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:34.830 align:start position:0%
essentially forgave the 58 million
dollars

03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
that you referred to as a cliff that
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
burgess is facing
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
what will happen beyond that will they
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
continue to accumulate
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
overcharges in the cumulative cumulative
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
reduction fund
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
and does this bill provide any way to
 
03:39:53.760 --> 03:39:54.630 align:start position:0%
and does this bill provide any way to
deal

03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
deal
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
future accumulation
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
it leaves it in the hands of the puc
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
but what i mentioned at the end of my
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
testimony the fact that they're
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
operating at nearly a break-even point
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
um higher wholesale electric rates given
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
the energy situation in the northeast
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
all across this nation right now
 
03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's at much more of a break-even point
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think you will also hear testimony
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the node
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
of where the power is delivered into the
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
grid that locational pricing
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
for this power plant is well below what
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
it would be at other points if it were
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
delivered in new england
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
i think an argument can be made mr chair
 
03:40:46.319 --> 03:40:48.229 align:start position:0%
i think an argument can be made mr chair
that

03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the value of this power is being
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
undervalued as it gets sold back
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
to eversource and if that's accounted
 
03:40:56.720 --> 03:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
to eversource and if that's accounted
for

03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:40:57.600 --> 03:40:59.269 align:start position:0%
for
the

03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
situation that you're talking about with
 
03:41:03.189 --> 03:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
ratepayer subsidies
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
may look a lot different i think the
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
other thing and i didn't mention this in
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
my testimony and i'd be remiss and not
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
talking about it i'm sure as you are
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
aware and this committee is aware
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:41:16.479 --> 03:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
of the
stress

03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
stress
 
03:41:17.760 --> 03:41:18.630 align:start position:0%
stress
that

03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
base load generation could potentially
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
have in new england per the independent
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
system operator now look i'm not going
 
03:41:28.080 --> 03:41:28.870 align:start position:0%
system operator now look i'm not going
to

03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
say that 75 megawatts is the end-all
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
be-all but every bit helps especially
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
when it's a fuel source that we control
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
that it's not from outside this region
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
or outside this country that it is
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
renewable that it is 24 7 that it is 365
 
03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
days a year exactly the kind of reliable
 
03:41:55.110 --> 03:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
um source of power
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
that the grid operator
 
03:42:00.389 --> 03:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
in new england thinks that we need to
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to prevent
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
rolling blackout type of situation that
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think none of us want
 
03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions for
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
senator bradley representative
 
03:42:12.720 --> 03:42:14.150 align:start position:0%
senator bradley representative
harrington

03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
03:42:15.510 --> 03:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and uh thank you for
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator um
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
one thing you're implying that this
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
plant is up 24
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
7 365 days of the year are you stating
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
that it is 100 capacity factor
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
no it's not a 100 percent capacity
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
factor but it is a baseload plant that
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
can operate
 
03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:35.990 align:start position:0%
can operate
um

03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
all of the time except for you know that
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
kind of maintenance
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up follow-up uh you talked
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
about iso new england saying this is uh
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
essential for
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
um the grid security and preventing
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
blackouts so have you heard or
 
03:42:55.110 --> 03:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable that if this plant were to
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
close down that iso new england would
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
insta instrument a rmr proceeding
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
reliability must run which they do to
 
03:43:04.150 --> 03:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
plants that they say are required to run
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
for that because i have not heard that
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
maybe no i haven't heard that either but
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
the point i was making representative
 
03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
harrington is that
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
at a time that the iso new england is
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
very concerned about
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
baseload power going offline
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
if this plant goes offline that just
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
contributes to
 
03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
contributes to
um

03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
less reliable grid and less reliable
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
power in new england and i think that's
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
the issue that is it's generic factor
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're not specific to the yeah that's
 
03:43:37.510 --> 03:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
generic yes and one final up go ahead uh
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the in your page they're on page two
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
and line 23
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
i find this uh
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
interesting wording it says the public
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
utilities commission shall open the
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
docket to amend any of its orders as
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the continued
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
operation of the burgess plan
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
so we're basically instructing the the
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
puc to do whatever it takes how much it
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
takes whatever the expense is to keep
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
this plan operating is that intentional
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
and representative harrington i would
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
argue that was the intent of 577.
 
03:44:06.309 --> 03:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes mega regardless of
 
03:44:06.319 --> 03:44:08.309 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes mega regardless of
cost

03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:44:08.319 --> 03:44:09.269 align:start position:0%
cost
it's

03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
the language is clear open a document uh
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
docket excuse me to protect the
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
continued operation yes thank you
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts has a
 
03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:22.309 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts has a
question

03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you just like old times
 
03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
thank you just like old times
um

03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify for me
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's a 58 million dollar
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
i want to call it a loan
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
would you envision
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
that loan being
 
03:44:44.070 --> 03:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
extended in other words so that some
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
payments could be
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
worked out over perhaps a very long
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
or would you envision that more money
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
would need to be thrown into this
 
03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:56.830 align:start position:0%
would need to be thrown into this
project

03:44:56.830 --> 03:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:44:56.840 --> 03:44:58.550 align:start position:0%
project
so

03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would envision several things that the
 
03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
i would envision several things that the
actual

03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
actual
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
value of the power be allocated properly
 
03:45:08.550 --> 03:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
that would reduce this
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
um cumulative reduction factor that's
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
crf be spread out over a longer period
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
of time so that it's not a cliff these
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
are all things that i think
 
03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:23.269 align:start position:0%
are all things that i think
the

03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:45:25.110 --> 03:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission would have
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
in their power through a settlement
 
03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:28.150 align:start position:0%
in their power through a settlement
proceeding

03:45:28.150 --> 03:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
03:45:28.160 --> 03:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
proceeding
to

03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
senator bradley representative lewicki
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
senator um a couple of questions just
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat for clarification when you said
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
75 megawatts is that burgess alone or is
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
that all of the wood chip plants uh the
 
03:45:53.830 --> 03:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
bridgewater plant is a about 15. so
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
burgess is 75. okay and you also said
 
03:45:58.150 --> 03:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the only ones that were operating
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
were burgess and bridgewater that's
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
because i saw the one i came down 89 on
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
sunday afternoon and the one near
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
grantham was running
 
03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that okay so anyway you
 
03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:11.349 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that okay so anyway you
know

03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions
 
03:46:18.150 --> 03:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
i i i want to kind of uh underscore or
 
03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
ask you to
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit on
 
03:46:31.279 --> 03:46:32.469 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit on
the

03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh other
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that that plant provides aside
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
from this purely the energy component
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
and how that impacts all of
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire economy
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
and i also want to ask you um that if
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
that which would you agree with me that
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know as legislators whether
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
representatives or senators
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that one of our
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
03:47:03.510 --> 03:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
priorities should be
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure we don't eliminate people's
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
jobs in new hampshire
 
03:47:07.120 --> 03:47:08.309 align:start position:0%
jobs in new hampshire
so

03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question obviously
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
there is a jobs impact um
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's very clear there's also
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
an impact on
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
jobs and
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
the health of the forest products
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
industry as people that work in the
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
forest products industry
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
and harvest low-grade wood have to have
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
an outlet for it or else it becomes
 
03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:31.110 align:start position:0%
an outlet for it or else it becomes
either

03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
much more expensive or impossible i
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
suppose in some instances to be able to
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
dispose of that product
 
03:47:39.199 --> 03:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
dispose of that product
so

03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain healthy forests
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
um where landowners are trying to
 
03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:49.110 align:start position:0%
um where landowners are trying to
um

03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know protect the long-term viability
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
of their of their forest harvesting
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
the low-grade wood to favor the
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
high-grade timber is very important
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be an outlet for that so
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that health of the forest along with
 
03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:04.550 align:start position:0%
that health of the forest along with
jobs

03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
jobs
and

03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
an indigenous renewable fuel source that
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly grows in new hampshire i
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
think those are all pretty
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
valuable facets
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:22.469 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
mcgee

03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
my question goes back to the three-year
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
suspension because i think when i was uh
 
03:48:32.710 --> 03:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
learning more about this particular
 
03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:37.429 align:start position:0%
learning more about this particular
um

03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
plant and the history
 
03:48:39.600 --> 03:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
plant and the history
uh

03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
i heard that there might have been a
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation on the part of the
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission in terms of
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
whether that suspension
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh was on the plant or or otherwise so i
 
03:48:53.670 --> 03:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
wonder if you were around for that or if
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with how that came to be
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
if you could give us a little more
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
information about
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
what a three-year suspension was
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
intended to mean what it would what did
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
the suspension entail in terms of the
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
money so i did not intervene in that in
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
that docket at the puc so i wasn't part
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
of any of the discussions or what ended
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
up being the case but my understanding
 
03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:16.870 align:start position:0%
up being the case but my understanding
is

03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:19.110 --> 03:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
out of that proceeding
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
what was agreed to and the plant was in
 
03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
a position of kind of take it or leave
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
it and
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today
 
03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:35.269 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today
okay

03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is the
 
03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:42.550 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is the
money

03:49:42.550 --> 03:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
that 58 million payback was suspended
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
was it suspended on the collection of
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that payback for eversource in other
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
words has that 58 million been included
 
03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
in rates
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
today i assume not but that's a question
 
03:50:02.309 --> 03:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
that um others can answer
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think it might be but that's okay
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'm taking my
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
question one thing i've noticed on here
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
is there's no mention of the cost
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note there's the only
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
thing i see at the very end of the bill
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
any relief ordered by the public
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
utilities commission not otherwise
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
funded by federal funds pursuant to this
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
section shall be fully recovered from
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
rate payers so i guess
 
03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:30.710 align:start position:0%
rate payers so i guess
first

03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
when you say rate payers do you mean
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
just ever source rate payers all rate
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
payers in the state
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
of wholesale you know municipal rate
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
payers what is that limited to and how
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
much is the estimated cost going to be
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
it would depend on the estimated cost
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
would depend on what the commission
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
ordered for relief it would depend on as
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
i keep citing the value assigned to the
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
power which
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think you will hear testimony
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
is undervalued
 
03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
is undervalued
and

03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:03.840 --> 03:51:05.269 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of the first part of your
 
03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:08.389 align:start position:0%
in terms of the first part of your
question

03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
the purchase power agreement is between
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
burgess and eversource so it's
 
03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
eversource ratepayers
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
which is historically
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
for all utilities how purchase power
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
agreements have um
 
03:51:20.720 --> 03:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
agreements have um
operated

03:51:24.150 --> 03:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative bradley i have one
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
final question for you we received an a
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
letter from the office office of the
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
in which the consumer advocate stated
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
that sb 271 as amended
 
03:51:44.309 --> 03:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
would violate the divestiture settlement
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
as duly bargained by the office of the
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate on behalf of
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
could you explain
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to respond to that so
 
03:51:58.710 --> 03:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
probably best if i don't respond to it
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
as somebody that was involved in the
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
divestiture docket
 
03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
divestiture docket
um

03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
it was really about power plants that
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
were owned yes contracts like this were
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
involved in it but um
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it would violate it
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
but that's just my opinion okay thank
 
03:52:18.399 --> 03:52:19.349 align:start position:0%
but that's just my opinion okay thank
you

03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum has a question
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
senator

03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
senator
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
the springfield plant was uh mentioned
 
03:52:29.830 --> 03:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
by my colleague representative levicky
 
03:52:32.150 --> 03:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
when when when the prices get high
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
enough the those plants do run as peaker
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
plants to
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
maximize their uh return
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it brings up the point which i don't
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
think has been clarified here that this
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
this plant makes a big difference
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
statewide and the low the low-grade
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
timber is a problem that is statewide
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
03:52:55.120 --> 03:52:56.309 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
certainly

03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
is critically involved here we have a
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
tourist-based economy if we have an
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
accumulation of low-grade wood in the
 
03:53:04.469 --> 03:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
forest that's going to impact
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
cross-country skiing hiking tourism it's
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
also going to be a fire hazard there are
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
numerous values that are provided by
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
having a market for low-grade wood that
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
really have
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
not just ripple effects have substantial
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
effects on representative oxygen are you
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
asking a question or making a speech
 
03:53:25.510 --> 03:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry i am having difficulty
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
moving from the public hearing to the
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
executive session and back to the public
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
hearing and not and and making this a
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
question so if i may ask you
 
03:53:34.469 --> 03:53:34.479 align:start position:0%

witness table representative edith
tucker

03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.950 --> 03:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative welcome to
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
scne thank you
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%

i
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's hard to follow senator bradley a
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
very accomplished
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh and very knowledgeable about this
 
03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:17.189 align:start position:0%
uh and very knowledgeable about this
topic

03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm knowledgeable because i live in
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
coast county i'm knowledgeable also
 
03:54:24.150 --> 03:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
because i was a reporter for 25 years
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the coast county democrat and
 
03:54:29.110 --> 03:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
covered the closing of the mills the
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
opening of the biopower plant
 
03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
opening of the biopower plant
and

03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
it is a very important aspect
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
economically in berlin
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is also as
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
people have already mentioned
 
03:54:46.469 --> 03:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
very important to the forests
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
that we have a market for low-grade wood
 
03:54:52.229 --> 03:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's important the wildlife it's
 
03:54:54.150 --> 03:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
important to recreation
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
but i think at the moment
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
here in april of
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
2022 it's important that we have
 
03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:03.510 align:start position:0%
2022 it's important that we have
redundancy

03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
redundancy
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
of our power sources
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
particularly those that are
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
rooted in a new hampshire product that
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
is the wood we grow
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think we've all experienced going to
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
the store and seeing bare shelves
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think we do worry about rolling
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
blackouts particularly in a day and age
 
03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:28.150 align:start position:0%
blackouts particularly in a day and age
when

03:55:28.150 --> 03:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
the highest use of electricity is no
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
longer in the winter
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
but now in the summer because of
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
rising temperatures and people being
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
more used to air conditioning
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
i myself have had to buy fans
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh even in randolph
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
but it's that
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
enormous change that i think we're all
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
grappling with
 
03:55:57.189 --> 03:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
that has happened with
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
russia attacking the ukraine
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of disruption in the supply
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
chains that's been going on since the
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic began
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
we really are in a different world and
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have a changing global economy
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
and it affects us here in new hampshire
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
it seems
remarkable

03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
remarkable
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we would be talking about taking an
 
03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
that we would be talking about taking an
up-to-date

03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
up-to-date
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
biomass plant with fluidized beds and
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
all the bells and whistles
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
of an up-to-date
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
biomass plant and thinking of closing it
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
at a time when we need to know
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we have this base load
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
capacity right here
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we still have the forest industry
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
with people with cut to length machines
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
ready to go out and do forest
 
03:56:54.319 --> 03:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
ready to go out and do forest
harvesting

03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
harvesting
 
03:56:55.760 --> 03:56:56.710 align:start position:0%
harvesting
those

03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:56:56.720 --> 03:56:58.389 align:start position:0%
those
investments

03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
investments
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
in the biomass plant
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
in all the equipment that goes out with
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
lagers today
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
i went to a lecture maybe 20 years ago
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
by a unh professor who said if you can't
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
think lie in bed at night and think
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
about owing a million dollars don't go
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
in today today's logging business
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking about this is
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
an industry it's no longer
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
a few people going out and
 
03:57:25.279 --> 03:57:26.309 align:start position:0%
a few people going out and
with

03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:57:26.319 --> 03:57:28.389 align:start position:0%
with
uh

03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
saws or chainsaws this is a big industry
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
it needs to continue
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
at the rate that it now is if it's going
 
03:57:38.469 --> 03:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i personally think we need to
 
03:57:40.720 --> 03:57:42.550 align:start position:0%
and i personally think we need to
support

03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire products we need to
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
support new hampshire employees
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very important step
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
to consider closing a plant of this
 
03:57:53.120 --> 03:57:54.389 align:start position:0%
to consider closing a plant of this
magnitude

03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
magnitude
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
give every consideration
 
03:57:58.640 --> 03:57:59.590 align:start position:0%
give every consideration
to

03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
preserving what is very important to the
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
whole state and of course to my home
 
03:58:05.359 --> 03:58:06.309 align:start position:0%
whole state and of course to my home
county

03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
county
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
um as you spoke about um that you know
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the value to the economy
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm struck by i had received a letter
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
from a constituent who is a landowner he
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
owns forest land
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
and it strikes me that that's another
 
03:58:31.349 --> 03:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
piece of the argument here is sort of
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
keeping land
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the hands of people in new hampshire
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
who are landowners because what he when
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
he wrote to me he said he had
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
450 acres
 
03:58:44.229 --> 03:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
and that the value of him being able to
 
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
keep hold of that land had to do with
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
him being able to sell his timber and so
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
i wonder if if you are aware at all of
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
that being another of the downstream
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
impacts that would happen if new
 
03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire's low-grade wood is not in use
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
because he basically said the value of
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
my land is in that low-grade timber
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i think we know
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
from the tax
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
property tax arrangements here in new
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire that that's long been known
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to make it possible for
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
keep people to keep forests we know that
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
the snowmobiling industry and now the
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
atv industries
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
are dependent on the goodwill of private
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
landowners and opening up their
 
03:59:26.720 --> 03:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
landowners and opening up their
properties

03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:59:28.000 --> 03:59:28.870 align:start position:0%
properties
to

03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
other people using it and
 
03:59:31.199 --> 03:59:31.990 align:start position:0%
other people using it and
not

03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
charging for that
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
are it's a part of the fabric of new
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire's travel and tourism industry
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
everything depends on
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
the other things and
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
the markets are just very very important
 
03:59:53.670 --> 03:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
for this low grade wood i didn't quite
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand that when i first got into it
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
but now i've seen a lot of wood
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood drive by my house
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
and on route 2
 
04:00:02.080 --> 04:00:02.950 align:start position:0%
and on route 2
and

04:00:02.950 --> 04:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
one knows that it is necessary and it in
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
order to have high grade wood
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
which can turn into saw logs
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
and allow that take it
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
make it
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
important that we
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
have first that can grow big and tall
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
and thick
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
you have to remove
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
the low-grade wood you have to have some
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
kind of income stream to support that
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
owner whether it's a teemo one of the
 
04:00:34.150 --> 04:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
industrial forest investment companies
 
04:00:36.309 --> 04:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
that are here in new hampshire and
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
throughout northern new england or
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's an individual
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
who depends on
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
being able to help send their
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to college
 
04:00:46.080 --> 04:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to college
by

04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
well-timed timber harvesting it's it's
 
04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's an integrated
 
04:00:54.070 --> 04:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
and remarkably
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
interdependent relationship between all
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
these factors
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and when i first
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
started reporting on it when people said
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
oh well it's like moving a table you
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
know everyone just moves it along an
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
inch or two and it's all together
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't be
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
but that is the way it is and this
 
04:01:16.000 --> 04:01:17.030 align:start position:0%
but that is the way it is and this
plant

04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
plant
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
is one of those lifts that's absolutely
 
04:01:20.000 --> 04:01:21.110 align:start position:0%
is one of those lifts that's absolutely
essential

04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
essential
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative samsung has a question
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that you've been
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
living up there for a long time and had
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
reporting duties to do as well
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
i would assume that you have followed
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
the trajectory of what has happened when
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
the paper mills closed
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
and when the other biomass plants who
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
are no longer in business also closed
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
and you probably saw firsthand
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
what the impact was locally in your area
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
can you describe some of that to us
 
04:01:56.080 --> 04:01:57.830 align:start position:0%
can you describe some of that to us
well

04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's hard to describe we're talking
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
about thousands and thousands of jobs
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
and on the way we're talking about
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
people who lost the pensions they
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to be able to
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
depend on
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
they lost their health insurance
 
04:02:16.710 --> 04:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
they often weren't paid
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
so on their last
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
jobs and loads of
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
of wood that they brought they never
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
were paid for that
 
04:02:25.520 --> 04:02:26.710 align:start position:0%
were paid for that
and

04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
it had a devastating effect and
 
04:02:29.680 --> 04:02:31.269 align:start position:0%
it had a devastating effect and
remarkably

04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
remarkably
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
people are resilient they do find other
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
things to do
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
but we're still losing population
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
of course we think that
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
being able to work remotely will make a
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
big difference
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
that there's been a turnaround and
 
04:02:45.439 --> 04:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
that there's been a turnaround and
people

04:02:46.710 --> 04:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to live near the outdoors and so
 
04:02:52.150 --> 04:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:54.150 --> 04:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
there is an interrelationship between
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
all these things that's hard to describe
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
the groveton mill that
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
took low-grade wood and made it into
 
04:03:02.399 --> 04:03:03.349 align:start position:0%
took low-grade wood and made it into
uh

04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know the things you pallets
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it's pallet wood too
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
and what happened when the pallet market
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
ended when people weren't shipping
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
things out they didn't need pallets
 
04:03:15.600 --> 04:03:16.550 align:start position:0%
things out they didn't need pallets
and

04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
the temptation of course was to toss
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
them in the river
 
04:03:22.150 --> 04:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh which i'm happy to say didn't happen
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
much but
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
it uh there is an interdependency
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
of our economy with the forests and the
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
the places people want to fish
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.150 --> 04:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're here partly because of those
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
markets for low-grade wood so i i don't
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
know the technical parts that many other
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
people who are here can
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
talk to you about but i wanted to give
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
you the big picture
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
of what it's like
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
to be in koas koas is an outdoor place
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
and the forests are an integral part
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
and the people who depend on those jobs
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
they're a very important part too
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
we also have another representative from
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
the north country representative the
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
verge who would also like to speak with
 
04:04:18.319 --> 04:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
verge who would also like to speak with
us

04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative harrington
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
had a question for
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
oops thank you mr speaker thank you
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
it appears looking at this build what
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to do is require all the ever
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
source rate payers in the state to pay
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
an extra subsidy to this biomass plant
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
so we can stay open and the idea is what
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
i hear from you is that this has all
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
sorts of benefits besides just the plan
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
itself in coast county
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
so i would ask do you think this is a
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
pertinent economic plan for the state
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh the apple growers in the central and
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
southern part of new hampshire decided
 
04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
to come up and said we can't make enough
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
money uh selling apples anymore so we're
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to sell all our apple farms and
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to let them go to condos or
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
whatever should they then be a fee
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
charge to everybody that buys produce in
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to subsidize the apple
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
farmers or maybe the lobster fishermen
 
04:05:20.550 --> 04:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
say they can't make enough money so
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
should they be able to collect the fee
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
from everybody to you
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
probably the difference is
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
that apples much as i love them
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
are not essential
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
to our life i think the apple farmers
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
would disagree with you well
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think the lobstermen or the
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
apple growers would say that
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
their product was in the same category
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
as electricity in this state
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
we have a place where renewable energy
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
from a local product can be manufactured
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
it is really a very special thing and
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
now that we see
 
04:06:00.720 --> 04:06:01.590 align:start position:0%
now that we see
how

04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:06:01.600 --> 04:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
how
vulnerable

04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
we are to rapid change and that's what
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've been experiencing in the last two
 
04:06:09.120 --> 04:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
we've been experiencing in the last two
years

04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
so it was march 2020 that we began to
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
really understand what the pandemic was
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to bring us
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
we're still not at the end of it
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
we now have
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
a really horrific war going on an open
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
war between two countries
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have a very disrupted world
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
we have a chance here
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
to keep stability that is operating at
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
04:06:38.880 --> 04:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
and i think
this

04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
i know the word subsidy i'm a good
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
capitalist too
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and that word
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
is not a pleasant one to hear
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
but stability is very important and i
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative tucker

04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%

better suited to answer questions that i
cannot

04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%

um there's i'm not an expert in this
 
04:08:58.800 --> 04:08:59.830 align:start position:0%
um there's i'm not an expert in this
field

04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
but i cannot overemphasize what has been
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of forest management
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
my family's business is cars but my
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
sister who runs it now
 
04:09:11.760 --> 04:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
sister who runs it now
has

04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:09:12.560 --> 04:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
has
several

04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
a few thousand acres of forest land in
 
04:09:16.319 --> 04:09:17.269 align:start position:0%
a few thousand acres of forest land in
maine

04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
maine
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you remember this
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
when this occurred and i think it's
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
germane to this uh that horrific ice
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
storms in the middle eighties maybe
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of forest land was was damaged and
 
04:09:28.960 --> 04:09:30.229 align:start position:0%
a lot of forest land was was damaged and
and

04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
destroyed so to speak
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
um she had spent several thousand
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
dollars going into the timberland
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
which is mostly high grade lumber
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
to clean that mess up and had no place
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
to put it at the time and that's the
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood we're talking about um so
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of forest management and all of
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
our safeties in every county
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
um this is vitally important to have
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
04:10:02.000 --> 04:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
the cost
well

04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
i i serve on finance and
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
i was in business many years
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
and the relevance and the importance of
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
this somebody asked how did this
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
impact the closing of the mills how did
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
it impact colosse county
 
04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:18.950 align:start position:0%
it impact colosse county
um

04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
i could give you
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh this anecdotal for sure but i can
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
explain it this way best from my
 
04:10:25.279 --> 04:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
explain it this way best from my
perspective

04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
i moved there
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
in 1977 i bought a business in berlin
 
04:10:31.439 --> 04:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
in 1977 i bought a business in berlin
and

04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
it allowed me
 
04:10:33.840 --> 04:10:35.670 align:start position:0%
it allowed me
to

04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
raise six wonderful children educate
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
them all
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
and retire at a relatively young age and
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful and part of my due
 
04:10:43.199 --> 04:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful and part of my due
diligence

04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
diligence
 
04:10:47.110 --> 04:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
prior to buying that business
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
was you check out the area you check out
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
the economic stability of the area and
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
one thing in doing that i found that
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
between fifteen and sixteen thousand
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
paper workers
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the in coast county
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
and those paperworks workers got a
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable wage and there was at the
 
04:11:06.800 --> 04:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
reasonable wage and there was at the
time

04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
stability in their employment
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the things that
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
spurred me to buy that business and uh
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
through the years i employed over 30
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
people and
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
would like to hope that i was part of
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
the economic benefit of of that and that
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
might speak best to how that impacts it
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
was impacted because right now i believe
 
04:11:28.479 --> 04:11:29.429 align:start position:0%
was impacted because right now i believe
there's

04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
a little less than 200 paper workers in
 
04:11:31.760 --> 04:11:32.830 align:start position:0%
a little less than 200 paper workers in
cowas

04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
cowas
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
county fifteen sixteen thousand two
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
hundred and
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
plus um and that's
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
really speaks to the impact the closing
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the mills had to cost county as far
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
as the cost and one thing
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
i try to do in my position in finance
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
and in my life
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
is is i try to look cost benefit ratios
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
now to the question of the race payer's
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to pay this this was already
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
absorbed by us
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
just consider that
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i suspect and i'm talking about
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
impact of rates i suspect that one
 
04:12:08.720 --> 04:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
impact of rates i suspect that one
person

04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
had to turn their lights off for one
 
04:12:12.479 --> 04:12:13.830 align:start position:0%
had to turn their lights off for one
minute

04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
minute
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
i i suspect not one person
 
04:12:18.550 --> 04:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
had to change their way of life
 
04:12:18.560 --> 04:12:20.149 align:start position:0%
had to change their way of life
dramatically

04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um absorbing this cost because it was
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
spread out amongst us all
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
and and microly the impact
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
but the advantages are vast macrally we
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
can come up and say well this is costing
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
such and such million dollars over a
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
period of
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
time collectively putting the whole
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
thing together multiplying by whatever
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
period of time you come up with
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
and you can talk about millions and
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars depending on the
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
period of time and depending
 
04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
on how much you collect
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't even know that that's
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
truly relevant at this point
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
if we could quantify the benefits
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
and there's many life benefits that are
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
hard to quantify with dollar and cents
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
compared to the cost um
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
there is really an equitable because i i
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
just truly believe and kind of know
 
04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
the benefits from this plan for the
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
entire state not just carlos county very
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
important to us of course
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's our last horse
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
it really um
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
has a
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
wide reaching benefit for every county
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
um forest management
 
04:13:44.309 --> 04:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
lumber comes from low grade com london
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
comes from every county in the state
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
so there's also a widespread economic
 
04:13:49.520 --> 04:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
so there's also a widespread economic
benefit

04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
and cost
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
we already absorbed it
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it really did not damage our overall
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
economy and i don't believe it damaged
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
anybody's personal position in life and
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
i would just ask you to really look at
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
that and consider that because i think
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's relevant and very important thank
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hatch
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
as long as it's not technical
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a car guy so go ahead
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
they just had to move mine because the
 
04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
kid they were going to hit it with the
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
04:14:33.110 --> 04:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative hatch is
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
apparently or i'm hearing that you know
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
they might need more money that that
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
burgess might need more money
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask you a question from
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
your position on another committee
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
is there money available
 
04:14:49.359 --> 04:14:50.550 align:start position:0%
is there money available
for

04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
a plant like burgess from some of the
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
that we have collected
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i i can't answer that because i
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
that would only be answered at the time
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
it comes it's it's a it's an important
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
question but it's not something that i'd
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
even be appropriate on my part to speak
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative hatch for coming here and
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
talking to us about this
 
04:15:21.199 --> 04:15:22.309 align:start position:0%
talking to us about this
um

04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask you obviously it's a
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
question that's more a hypothetical
 
04:15:26.560 --> 04:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
question that's more a hypothetical
question

04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:15:27.840 --> 04:15:28.630 align:start position:0%
question
but

04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
if you knew
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
i mean if if you were to ask new
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
whether they would be willing to
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
pay a small surcharge on their energy
 
04:15:38.560 --> 04:15:39.429 align:start position:0%
pay a small surcharge on their energy
use

04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
in exchange for keeping new hampshire
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
jobs and securing them
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
do you think that people would be more
 
04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
favorable uh more than half would say
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that or not
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
well i only can speak
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
for myself and now in those terms and i
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
can only speak for my extended family
 
04:15:57.439 --> 04:15:58.389 align:start position:0%
can only speak for my extended family
um

04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%

04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
very much so yes and uh the circles that
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%

04:16:07.110 --> 04:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh my friends very much yes um and i
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
just have to add as i'm one of those

that
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
send a couple dollars extra to the power
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
company so those that might not be able

04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
say that i'm going to be as brief as
 
04:18:32.000 --> 04:18:33.110 align:start position:0%
say that i'm going to be as brief as
possible

04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
before we get into
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
sb 271 and what it does i'd first like
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
to speak about what it doesn't do
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
sb 271 does not impose any new costs on
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and the bill does not ask for
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
any additional relief for burgess
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
biopower going forward
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the costs under consideration have
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
already been collected
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is narrowly focused
 
04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that was only introduced to
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
correct how sb 577 was implemented at
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
as senator bradley had mentioned the
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of 577 was to provide burgess
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
with limited financial relief for a
 
04:19:18.070 --> 04:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
finite period of time
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
it did that by suspending the operation
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the cap on the cost override
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism in burgess's power purchase
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
agreement for three years
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
in passing that bill the legislature
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
intended that the costs that were
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
accrued during the three-year suspension
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
period would be borne by rate payers not
 
04:19:34.960 --> 04:19:36.229 align:start position:0%
period would be borne by rate payers not
burgess

04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
burgess
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is supported by the fiscal note
 
04:19:39.750 --> 04:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill when it passed as
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
well as other testimony and supporting
 
04:19:41.600 --> 04:19:43.429 align:start position:0%
well as other testimony and supporting
documents

04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
documents
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
the regulatory process to implement sb
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
577 took over 18 months
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
during which the facility reached its
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar cap
 
04:19:55.110 --> 04:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
burgess was then faced with a choice
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
between either accepting a settlement
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that didn't reflect the legislative
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
intent of sb 577 or suffer the economic
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
damage that the legislation was supposed
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
to have prevented
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
burgess reluctantly accepted a
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
settlement that deferred costs during
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
the three-year period but did not
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
forgive them
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
the final order on that proceeding was
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
issued in february of 2020 and i think
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
that we all know what happened after
 
04:20:19.680 --> 04:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
that we all know what happened after
that

04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
when the world changed
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
probably irrevocably
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
and our focus shifted immediately to our
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
role as an essential energy
 
04:20:29.680 --> 04:20:32.309 align:start position:0%
role as an essential energy
infrastructure

04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
now burgess must repay the sb 577
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
three-year suspension costs in a single
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
year beginning this december which will
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
financially devastate the plant
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
the repayment will occur in monthly
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
increments where the amount due will be
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
withheld from burgess's monthly energy
 
04:20:48.319 --> 04:20:49.830 align:start position:0%
withheld from burgess's monthly energy
payment

04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
the monthly repayment amount will be
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars more than burgess's
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
monthly revenue which means the facility
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
would operate at an unsustainable loss
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
each month and would be forced to close
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just once again reiterated
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
that costs associated with sb 577 have
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
already been collected from from
 
04:21:07.439 --> 04:21:08.630 align:start position:0%
already been collected from from
ratepayers

04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
sb 271 imposes no new costs and to
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
answer representative rose's previous
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
question burgess is not requesting any
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
additional support we assume the full
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
risk and responsibility going forward
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
any future over market costs would be
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
burgess's responsibility and i think
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that burgess
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
returns more than three times its cost
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
and economic benefit to the entire state
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
passage of 271 will help ensure burgess
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
biopower's ongoing operation and the
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
energy economic and environmental
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
benefits that the facility provides
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sarah
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to be with
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
you this afternoon and speak on behalf
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
of sb271 uh on behalf of burgess
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
biopower as sarah indicated i am the
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
asset manager for the facility i have
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
the technical fiscal and regulatory
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the execution of the
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
plan on a day-to-day basis
 
04:22:09.920 --> 04:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
plan on a day-to-day basis
um

04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
i think that some of the speakers that
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
have come before us and some that will
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
come after us have done a really good
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
job and will do an even better job and
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
speaking to the myriad of benefits that
 
04:22:23.110 --> 04:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
the project brings to the state uh
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
energy economic environmental um and
 
04:22:25.600 --> 04:22:27.030 align:start position:0%
energy economic environmental um and
employment

04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think what i'd like to try to do is
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
try to put some of that into perspective
 
04:22:30.159 --> 04:22:31.189 align:start position:0%
try to put some of that into perspective
right

04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
so burgess is the fourth largest
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
generator of power in new hampshire the
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
three generators that are larger rely
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
upon natural gas and nuclear power so
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's the only plant that is providing
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
500 000 megawatt hours of class 1
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy to the state of new
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire on a very very reliable basis
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and to representative harrington's
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
question about is it 100
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
no it averages about 92
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
which according to black beach
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
management consulting one of the largest
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
consulting organizations on earth is
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
among the five percent top performing
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
power plants in the country
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
the power that burgess produces is
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient to power 67 000 new hampshire
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
homes so it's not a trivial piece it's
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the homes in new hampshire
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
and as senator bradley pointed out it is
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
base load power uh that is dispatchable
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
by iso
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
it can be called upon and we run pretty
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
much 24 7. we do take two weeks of
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
outage every year to maintain the plant
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
we basically tear it apart and rebuild
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
it so it can run another six months
 
04:23:35.840 --> 04:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
it so it can run another six months
um

04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
so it's a critical source of energy
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
diversity and and grid stability that's
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
a really important piece um from the
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
energy sector it's not powered on
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
natural gas so that when consumers
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
residents here in new hampshire need gas
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
to heat their homes burgess isn't
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
consuming that gas and it's available to
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
them and the grid operators we've all
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
heard and read numerous times has warned
 
04:24:01.830 --> 04:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
us about the over alliance 60 of our
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
fleet right now in new england that is
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
burgess also has a significant
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
environmental benefit
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i know that sheila conley from
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
resource management is here
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll speak to that further but rmi
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
recycles the fly ash that we produce in
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
our boiler um so in
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
um we recycled over 20 000 tons of fly
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
ash from our boiler that was
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
beneficially reused as an agricultural
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment on farmers farms over 4 000
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
acres of farms 70 different farms
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
around the area
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
so again
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not this is not just a north
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
country issue and it's not just a
 
04:24:44.960 --> 04:24:46.630 align:start position:0%
country issue and it's not just a
forestry

04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
forestry
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
harvester trucker issue it impacts a
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
number of businesses in a very wide
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
geographic reach
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
and i'll let jason stock speak more to
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
the overall forestry management but
 
04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
again to put things in perspective
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
burgess buys about 800 000 tons of
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood a year that's in excess
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
of 25 million dollars that gets injected
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
into the forestry economy and with our
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
testimony you'll see a map of the great
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire with a bunch of
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
trees on it
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
those trees represent every single
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
location from which burgess biopower
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
the little burgess icon is way up here
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
in the north country but boy by the
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
amount of trees down here you'd think we
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
were probably located in concord
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'd say that this facility has a much
 
04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
greater impact upon land managers and
 
04:25:39.199 --> 04:25:40.389 align:start position:0%
greater impact upon land managers and
landowners

04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
in the southern tier of the state than
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
it does in the northern tier
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
and again jason can speak to it with
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
more authority than myself but
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges that those land
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
managers have is getting the money
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to properly maintain
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
their land or else they can just sell it
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
for development and that's what's
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
happened to a lot of the forestry that
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
is a lot of the forest that is no longer
 
04:26:02.319 --> 04:26:03.670 align:start position:0%
is a lot of the forest that is no longer
forest

04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
forest
 
04:26:03.680 --> 04:26:05.590 align:start position:0%
forest
um

04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about the economic
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
impacts of the facility
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
70 million dollars in annual economic
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
activity to the state so we are looking
 
04:26:14.399 --> 04:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
activity to the state so we are looking
to

04:26:15.510 --> 04:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
erase a
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
58 million dollar number um so that the
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
state can continue to have 70 million
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
dollars of economic activity in
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
perpetuity for the life of the plant
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
on a cost benefit analysis i wouldn't
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
say i would say that that's probably not
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
too bad a deal
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
um burgess injects
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars into the city
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
of berlin in taxes and fees and
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
interestingly burgess is the only power
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
plant that i know of and i've been doing
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
power projects for 35 years that shares
 
04:26:49.110 --> 04:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
its revenue with the toast community so
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
we take a portion of the revenue that we
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
generate from the sale of renewable
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
energy certificates and we give that to
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
the city of berlin that's totaled about
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars over the past three
 
04:27:00.960 --> 04:27:02.309 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars over the past three
years

04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
and really we're trying to do something
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
more than just be
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
a power generator right my colleagues
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
have heard me say this expression too
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
many times that
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
we like to say we're doing something
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
besides just chewing chips and making
 
04:27:13.680 --> 04:27:15.030 align:start position:0%
besides just chewing chips and making
megawatts

04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be a good active member
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
of our community
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
and facilitate economic development in
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the community we've worked very
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
diligently with the city for about a
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
three year period now to design a system
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
that can extract thermal energy from our
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
cooling water system and heat the city
 
04:27:35.110 --> 04:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
streets in the winter time that may
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
sound like a far-fetched notion but it's
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
been done in several locations across
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
the country
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
including the university of michigan and
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
east lansing
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so we continue to be very interested
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
in that we have talked with what was
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
gore and paper and tissue now white
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
mountain tissue about supplying them
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
with a portion of our cooling water loop
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is warm water one of the greatest
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
costs in paper making is heating water
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
so we're still continuing uh we continue
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be very interested in doing that as
 
04:28:01.920 --> 04:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
to be very interested in doing that as
well

04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
we cleared land we did explorations we
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
did all kinds of work to facilitate the
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
development of a greenhouse
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that company
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
decided that they had other projects
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
that they needed to focus on first and
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
foremost we worked with a number of
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency miners in developing site
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
plans and figuring out how they could
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
inter connect to us and and and get
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
power from us
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to do those things we
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
want to do those things um to help us
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
with our overall economics but to help
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the region
 
04:28:32.880 --> 04:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
the region
um

04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
and and continue to grow and i think the
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
most important point
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
or piece of this whole thing to me
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
is the guy who's responsible for 29
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
people that work at the plan are the
 
04:28:44.399 --> 04:28:45.429 align:start position:0%
people that work at the plan are the
people

04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:28:47.189 --> 04:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
so we have 29 people that work at our
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
plant many of them came to us
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the closure of the pulp mill
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we have several families that now
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
have multiple generations at our plant
 
04:28:58.479 --> 04:28:59.670 align:start position:0%
have multiple generations at our plant
so

04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
the senior person in the family said
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
sarah i know a great place for you to
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
work um and we have multiple generations
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
so we're doing one of the things that we
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do which is to attract younger
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
people into the area to to try to stem
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
the brain drain from people leaving the
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
region that have a good place to work
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
that is a challenging interesting
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
high-tech place to work
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i think we're doing that fairly well
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
and those people are they function as a
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
family they watch each other's back it's
 
04:29:31.269 --> 04:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
a closely knit group it's a great group
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
to be involved with but in addition to
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
those 29 people in their families
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's over 150 different companies
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
that cross our truck scales every year
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
delivering wood to burgess biopower
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
those are small typically family-owned
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that are truckers and
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
foresters and harvesters that have
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
reaped all the challenges of the other
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
closures of the biomass plants and the
 
04:29:54.800 --> 04:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
closures of the biomass plants and the
like

04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then in 240 jobs statewide and so
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's the most important part from my
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
perspective and we urge you to support
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
sp2 sb 271 as ought to pass as sarah
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
pointed out the legislation has a very
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
limited scope it has no additional cost
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
the costs have been paid for and the
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
impact to new hampshire is critically
 
04:30:16.720 --> 04:30:17.670 align:start position:0%
impact to new hampshire is critically
important

04:30:17.670 --> 04:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i have two questions one for

thank you i have two questions one for
mr

04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:30:22.880 --> 04:30:23.990 align:start position:0%
mr
um

04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
frecker and one for miss boone
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
first question for mr frecker
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that 800 000 tons of wood
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
were brought to the plant every year how
 
04:30:34.399 --> 04:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
were brought to the plant every year how
many

04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:30:36.000 --> 04:30:37.269 align:start position:0%
many
uh

04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:37.279 --> 04:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
uh
truck

04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
truck
 
04:30:38.159 --> 04:30:39.670 align:start position:0%
truck
trucking

04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
trucking
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh visits does that represent
 
04:30:43.359 --> 04:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh visits does that represent
and

04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
is there any way you could
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
estimate how much
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh co2 emissions are generated by all
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
those truck trips
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
i have not done the uh the co2 calculus
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um but if you consider that
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
we had 800 000 tons of wood delivered
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
and truck loads of wood are about 33
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
tons i don't have my calculator with me
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
but you can do that math 33 tons you
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
said yeah
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and for ms boone i have a
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
question you said that
 
04:31:17.439 --> 04:31:21.670 align:start position:0%
question you said that
um

04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.680 --> 04:31:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:22.399 --> 04:31:23.110 align:start position:0%
that
uh

04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
the company agreed to the settlement
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
agreement with the puc
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
if you didn't think that that settle
 
04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
agreement was correct why did you agree
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
to it
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
because we didn't feel like we had
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
another choice we had reached the 100
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar cap during the 18-month
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
long puc process and it was either
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
agreed to a settlement that we didn't
 
04:31:47.110 --> 04:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
feel reflected the actual intent of the
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.750 --> 04:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
that if order number 26233
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
was misinterpreting
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
the 2018 legislation
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
burgess biopower should not have
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly agreed to these terms instead
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the company should have sought appellate
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
relief at the new hampshire supreme
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
court did you consider doing that so we
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
have a response prepared to that letter
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
i we have not submitted it yet uh our
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
our regulatory i'm sorry our regulatory
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
attorney is here and can speak to those
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
issues in more detail if you would like
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
her to but i think um as someone who is
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not an attorney i can say that
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
the um the way the order was written the
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
commission did not rule on the issue of
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
cost recovery which is what would have
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
been appealable and there was nothing to
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
appeal and we were out of time
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
it was agree or go away
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
does your attorney maybe i should ask
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
the attorney this but
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
04:32:58.960 --> 04:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
is there any
concern

04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
that if the legislature
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially overrules a puc
 
04:33:05.520 --> 04:33:06.869 align:start position:0%
essentially overrules a puc
decision

04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
that that could interfere with
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
contractual rights secured to ever
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
source rate payers under article 1
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
section 10 of the united states
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
constitution and article or part 1
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
article 23 of the new hampshire
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
constitution good afternoon
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative vo's carol hollahan from
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
the law firm of foley hoag i serve as
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory counsel
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
for burgess i represented burgess in the
 
04:33:33.429 --> 04:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
puc hearing these issues were briefed
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
for the public utilities commission in
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
docket 10 195 right after senate bill
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
577 the puc declined to rule on them
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
that included both the constitutional
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
issues and the cost recovery issue
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
within the legislation by the time the
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
settlement was agreed was reached it was
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
almost december of 2019 the cap had been
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
reached and there was nothing appealable
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
at that time so sarah's testimony is
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely accurate that they were
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
forced into a corner of uh accepting a
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
settlement that was not beneficial to
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
them um or excuse me accepting a
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
settlement that did not reflect what
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
they felt or we felt was the intent of
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 577
 
04:34:15.520 --> 04:34:17.029 align:start position:0%
senate bill 577
and

04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:19.590 --> 04:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
be faced with immediate economic
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
hardship or to take what we could get to
 
04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
live to fight another day with respect
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the constitutional issues burgess
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
does not believe this
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature is
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
entitled according to the new hampshire
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
supreme court to
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
enact legislation that affects cons that
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
affects private contractual rights
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
provided that there is a legitimate and
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
specific purpose and provided that the
 
04:34:44.719 --> 04:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
specific purpose and provided that the
um

04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
the remedy it has chosen is reasonable
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
and necessary
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any question that
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
the findings section of senate bill 577
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrates a legitimate
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
purpose to which the legislature was
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
responding and i think the
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
solution it shows by enacting
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
relief for a discrete three year period
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
of time that was very narrow both in
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
time and
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
or very narrow in time
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
would pass the supreme court's test of
 
04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
would pass the supreme court's test of
necessary

04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable and necessary okay thank you
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
for that explanation
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
we have six more people who want to
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill i just want to alert
 
04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
everyone to that uh reality uh
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has a question
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
um first of all a very good testimony
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i agree with most of what you're
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
saying having been raised
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat in north country in orford but
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
being very familiar with the forest
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
industry as well
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
and i particularly heard you very
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
clearly when you said that
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would only
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
relieve you of the three years of
 
04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
payments and that you would expect or
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
get anything else going forward and was
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
i correct in that yes
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
follow please
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
so um what i'm concerned about not so
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
much with you but with this bill
 
04:36:16.949 --> 04:36:16.959 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
on the near the bottom of the first page
 
04:36:19.439 --> 04:36:20.230 align:start position:0%
on the near the bottom of the first page
it

04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
implies that that we would be directing
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
04:36:24.080 --> 04:36:25.109 align:start position:0%
the puc
to

04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
basically amend any orders as necessary
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the continued operation of
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
burgers buyer plant
 
04:36:32.160 --> 04:36:32.949 align:start position:0%
burgers buyer plant
so

04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
if the puc and we don't know what's
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen because they're in a
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
flux of change now with doe coming
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
forward we don't know who's going to be
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
there making decisions by the time this
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
comes forward
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
if the puc were to say
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
oh we think this should be permanent and
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
that you should never have to make a
 
04:36:50.959 --> 04:36:52.070 align:start position:0%
that you should never have to make a
payment

04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:36:52.080 --> 04:36:53.429 align:start position:0%
payment
um

04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
would you accept that or would you say
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
no we'll we'll rely on what we said here
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that will only you know pay back the
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
three years or uh i'm concerned that
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
this that what what might happen at the
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
pc is they may make a ruling that may be
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
more in your favor where the ratepayers
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
would continue to pay forever um and
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be on you on puc but i'm
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerned if what what would be your
 
04:37:16.240 --> 04:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
concerned if what what would be your
response

04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
response
 
04:37:19.510 --> 04:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
of to this bill the way it's worded is
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
is that a possibility that you would
 
04:37:21.119 --> 04:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
is that a possibility that you would
consider

04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
well i think we've been
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
quite explicit in what we're asking for
 
04:37:27.600 --> 04:37:28.949 align:start position:0%
quite explicit in what we're asking for
here

04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
what we believe the intent of sb 577 was
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
was that we would not be accruing those
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
charges during the three year suspension
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
period we have no attention to overreach
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
from what we believe the legislature
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
proposed before we are simply trying to
 
04:37:45.359 --> 04:37:46.310 align:start position:0%
proposed before we are simply trying to
follow

04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:37:48.629 --> 04:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
what sbc 577
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
we believe it was supposed to do and
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
that's all we want to do and we'll go
 
04:37:52.959 --> 04:37:55.189 align:start position:0%
that's all we want to do and we'll go
away

04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
okay next up representative uh
 
04:38:00.879 --> 04:38:04.869 align:start position:0%
okay next up representative uh
harrington

04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you thank my
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
question i have about 50 questions but
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm not going to ask that many
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
because of time factor so i'll try to
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
limit it to just two
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
capacity supply obligation in the
 
04:38:18.551 --> 04:38:18.561 align:start position:0%
forward capacity market in the future
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes we do and what year would that be
 
04:38:20.480 --> 04:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
yes we do and what year would that be
for

04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:38:22.000 --> 04:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
for
we

04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
renew our capacity supply obligation in
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
every fcm
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
65.2 megawatts
 
04:38:31.039 --> 04:38:32.189 align:start position:0%
65.2 megawatts
for

04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
2024. as as the years go forward
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you the second question uh it
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
follow up to what representative thomas
 
04:38:39.600 --> 04:38:40.551 align:start position:0%
follow up to what representative thomas
said

04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
you're very explicit here uh
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
this bill imposes no new cost on rate
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
payers and burgess is not requesting any
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
additional support we assume full risk
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
and responsibility going forward
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
so having read that i could assume then
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
we could
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
change or take out some of the portions
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill where it says the public
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
utilities commissions open the document
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
mending the orders as necessary to
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
protect the continued operation of
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
burge's bible power plant provided there
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
is no additional cost to the ratepayers
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then at the end we could amend it by
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
saying in just getting rid of this line
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
that says any relief ordered by the
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission not
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise funded by federal funds and
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this section shall be fully
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
recovered from rate payers because
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying there's no additional cost
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
so you would have no objection to
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
removing those sections of amending the
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.629 --> 04:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
i believe that the the last phrase that
 
04:39:30.639 --> 04:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
i believe that the the last phrase that
you

04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
described was actually specifically
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
requested to be included in the bill by
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
eversource so that is probably a better
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
question for them
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
well okay getting back can follow up
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
getting back to the the first part about
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
it then if it was i'll leave that
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
forever source but the part that says
 
04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the puc shall do whatever is necessary
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we if you would object to saying
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
provided there's no additional cost to
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers would you agree with that
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
language if you're not going to if
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're going to take full
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility and risk going forward
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think i'd like to have the opportunity
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
to confer with our council before enough
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you oh she's right
 
04:40:09.440 --> 04:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you oh she's right
there

04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.840 --> 04:40:12.788 align:start position:0%
 
clearly

04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
clearly representative that is our
 
04:40:14.320 --> 04:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
clearly representative that is our
intent

04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.680 --> 04:40:20.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative lowicky is recognized
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
for a question uh thank you mr chairman
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
and just for information that's 24 000
 
04:40:27.120 --> 04:40:29.110 align:start position:0%
and just for information that's 24 000
trucks

04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
and my question is um i was looking at
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
an email from last january
 
04:40:34.000 --> 04:40:34.948 align:start position:0%
an email from last january
and

04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
recently prior to that the price of oil
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
had gone negative in the market you
 
04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
could they were paying you 37 a barrel
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
to take oil away and we're now somewhere
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the range of 100 so we've got this
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
137 dollar swing
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
plus and minus of zero
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
at what
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
price of oil gas or some other uh fossil
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
fuel would you be able to break
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
even can't really tie it to a
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
fuel price representative because it
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
depends upon what assets within the
 
04:41:05.200 --> 04:41:06.230 align:start position:0%
depends upon what assets within the
overall

04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
iso new england fleet are operating on
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
those fuels and what their efficiencies
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
are and myriad other issues about node
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
connections and the like um but your
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
point is extremely well taken right you
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
know a a week ago just one week ago oil
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
was sitting at 110 a barrel and gas was
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
just under five
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
one week later
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
oil is at 94 and gas has increased by
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
over 25 percent
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing that 60 percent of the fleet
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
is powered on that fuel that has a
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
significant impact to the overall cost
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah please
 
04:41:45.360 --> 04:41:46.230 align:start position:0%
yeah please
and

04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
how does that affect you if uh for
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
instance gas plants are running
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
uneconomically does that mean that you
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
can charge more money for your
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
electricity it doesn't
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
our power price is is fixed over the
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
long the 20-year ppa so even when power
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
prices are skyrocketing we do not
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
financially benefit from that our ppa
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
provides price certainty over a long
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
period of time for a certain amount of
 
04:42:13.440 --> 04:42:15.510 align:start position:0%
period of time for a certain amount of
power

04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
18 minutes left in this public hearing
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i very much want to hear from the
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
so i think uh we will thank you for your
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
testimony on this legislation and ask mr
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
franz of the department of energy to
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay ask your question very quickly
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um earlier in
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony there was discussion about uh
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
where the node is located as far as its
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
input into the grid and i understand
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you're an asset of the iso new
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
england i don't know
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
where all the other assets are located
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and juxtaposition to
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
each other but i did note that there was
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
also an allusion to the fact that um
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
that that power was going into the grid
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
lower than
 
04:43:21.520 --> 04:43:22.390 align:start position:0%
lower than
other

04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
power entering the grid and there was
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
also a discussion of the the valuation
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
of that power being valued appropriately
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i i think before we lose you on the
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
stand i would like to know if you have
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
anything to say about that that accurate
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
valuation that maybe we are not aware of
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
i could simply show you the information
 
04:43:44.638 --> 04:43:45.510 align:start position:0%
i could simply show you the information
from

04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
iso's data files that show the
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
locational marginal price at various
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
nodes and you'll see that the berlin
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
node is typically five plus percent
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
lower than all of the other nodes if i
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
was whitefield if i was bridgepower
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
bridgewater if i was tamworth um all of
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
those are getting
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
above us and how does that help us
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
though can you just explain what that
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
means well
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
what it does is it it essentially
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
artificially devalues the power that
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
burgess generates when compared to the
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the market
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay now let's hear from the
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
welcome mr franz good to see you good to
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
see you too chairman bose
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and good afternoon to the
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
members of
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
st e
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know me i'm tom
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
france the director of regulatory
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
support at the new hampshire department
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
most of you probably knew me before when
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
i was at the public utilities commission
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
and director of electricity
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
the department of energy appreciates the
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide comments today on
 
04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 271.
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
as you know back in 2018 senate bill 577
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
was signed into law which directed the
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
puc to amend its order that approved the
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
ppa between psnh
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
and berlin biopower we'll just say
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
burgess at this point senate bill 577
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
suspended the operation of the cap on
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction factor for
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
three years as you've heard throughout
 
04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
that excess amount over the cumulative
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
reduction factor
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
is about 50.7 million as of the end of
 
04:45:38.680 --> 04:45:40.390 align:start position:0%
is about 50.7 million as of the end of
2021

04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:45:42.788 --> 04:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
and eversource forecasts in a recent
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
filing with the puc and and with the
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy that that would
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
go to about 58
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
59 million dollars by the end of
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
november of 2022. as you know the way
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
the ppa works that
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
excess amount over the 100 million
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
dollars would be re
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
funded essentially through a reduction
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
in in the price of energy in the ppa
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
as stated earlier that money has been
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
collected or is being collected from
 
04:46:15.120 --> 04:46:17.190 align:start position:0%
collected or is being collected from
ratepayers

04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:46:21.270 --> 04:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
they've paid it um
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
it would go back to customers if the
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
plant continued to operate it's uh
 
04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
questionable whether that would occur
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that that's been raised also
 
04:46:30.000 --> 04:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
and that that's been raised also
previously

04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
our position however is that however
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
well intentioned senate bill 577 was and
 
04:46:42.550 --> 04:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
i could take issue with that the puc at
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
the time did not understand
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the of the bill uh that's
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
and for the record i will take issue
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that i think the order is clear
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
about what would happen at the end of
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
the three years and the commission
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
stated so in the order
 
04:46:58.160 --> 04:46:58.948 align:start position:0%
stated so in the order
and

04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh as you've heard nobody appealed it we
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
could talk about why or that didn't
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
happen but we are where we are
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
the question now though is
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
this was in five senate senate bill 577
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
was intended to be a bridge
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
we should ask today a bridge to wear a
 
04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's no indication that these above
 
04:47:26.948 --> 04:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
energy costs
 
04:47:26.958 --> 04:47:27.910 align:start position:0%
energy costs
uh

04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:27.920 --> 04:47:29.350 align:start position:0%
uh
although

04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
although
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
lower today than they were will go away
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
um i wish that were the fact
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
although we'd have high
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
wholesale market prices if that were in
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
fact the case
 
04:47:40.718 --> 04:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
fact the case
but

04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
we see no
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
rosy picture here
 
04:47:46.958 --> 04:47:48.070 align:start position:0%
rosy picture here
um

04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that this won't
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
increase rates that this is a simple
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill that actually just
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
keeps the ppa in place
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
nothing but postpone what's going to
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
happen a year from now
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh it's very likely that
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be at the same place with
 
04:48:07.840 --> 04:48:08.788 align:start position:0%
we'll be at the same place with
the

04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars cumulative reduction
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
factor being triggered
 
04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and a question about whether the plant
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
will run and how much that will be and
 
04:48:19.750 --> 04:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
what will happen at that time
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
the department of energy opposes senate
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think you've
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
taken my question uh mr franz maybe you
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
can give us just a little way of
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
background about how this came about i
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
know obviously the plant was built
 
04:48:49.840 --> 04:48:50.708 align:start position:0%
know obviously the plant was built
uh

04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't have at its inception of this
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
guaranteed purchase power contract but
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
then it negotiated one uh i believe you
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
were intimately involved in those
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
negotiations as a matter of fact and how
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
is that set up and what's the payment
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
structure and why is it different than
 
04:49:05.840 --> 04:49:06.628 align:start position:0%
structure and why is it different than
say

04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
the londonderry gas plant or the
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
seabrook nuclear plant is how they sell
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
their power
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh we're going back over over a decade
 
04:49:15.360 --> 04:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
uh we're going back over over a decade
uh

04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative harrington but
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the original proposal for this plant was
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
a was a contract
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
agreement between psnh and a company
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
called blade law
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
and it was for a 20-year term
 
04:49:29.360 --> 04:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
and it was for a 20-year term
uh

04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
during the proceeding at the time
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
a new owner came in
 
04:49:34.718 --> 04:49:36.550 align:start position:0%
a new owner came in
purchased

04:49:36.550 --> 04:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
04:49:36.560 --> 04:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
purchased
the

04:49:38.230 --> 04:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
contractual rights to the ppa from
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
laid law
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
the commission had extensive hearings at
 
04:49:48.550 --> 04:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
the time concerning the costs the
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
benefits the terms of the contract
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
the commission ultimately approved this
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
contract it's a 20-year term with set
 
04:50:00.070 --> 04:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
conditions for energy purchases
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
it limits
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
how much
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
eversource is obligated to purchase for
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
energy 500 000 megawatt hours per year
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
it sets the price of those energy
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
purchases by year for the 20-year term
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
it has a renewable energy credit
 
04:50:20.550 --> 04:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
piece to it also that's 400 000 wrecks
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
of purchase per year at class 1
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh prices and those prices were under
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
the original rps statute
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
and it has a capacity segment also and
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
the capacity is
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
was set
 
04:50:33.760 --> 04:50:34.550 align:start position:0%
was set
back

04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
at the original time of the contract
 
04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
based on the best information what
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
capacity prices would be for each of the
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
reconfigured the revenue stream somewhat
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
for each of those pieces
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
and the contract was uh approved
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
there was a legal case taken to the
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court by the small wood powered
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh generators
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
there was then
 
04:51:05.680 --> 04:51:07.030 align:start position:0%
there was then
some

04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:51:09.350 --> 04:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
negotiations to
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
work with the wood power generators
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
which i led the negotiations for the
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
state and for the puc on uh along with
 
04:51:17.430 --> 04:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
many others including
 
04:51:17.440 --> 04:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
many others including
uh

04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and and and and others
 
04:51:22.400 --> 04:51:24.310 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and and and and others
so

04:51:24.310 --> 04:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
that ended up
 
04:51:25.840 --> 04:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
that ended up
resolving

04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
resolving
 
04:51:27.040 --> 04:51:28.470 align:start position:0%
resolving
the

04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
legal case of the new hampshire supreme
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
court the small power wood generators
 
04:51:35.190 --> 04:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
withdrew their case
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
this project got built and uh
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
off and running we were
 
04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's a short history of of this
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
project follow up mr chairman follow up
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
i'll try to make this real quick so when
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was put into place the concept was
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
provide for the financial stability for
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
this plant to continue operating under
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
that ppa without any additional
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
to build a project of this size requires
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think uh at least it did for this
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
project some financial guarantees and
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the ppa
 
04:52:11.280 --> 04:52:12.150 align:start position:0%
that's what the ppa
gives

04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
gives
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
this owner
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
the financial guarantee the commission
 
04:52:18.550 --> 04:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
concerned at the time about over market
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
costs and with a history of the
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities going back to 1986
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
1987 and 1988 and those orders that
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
fixed prices for a 20-year term for
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
those small wood power producers
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
basically put in a cap the 100 million
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
dollar cumulative reduction factor which
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
was meant to
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
to some degree minimize the risk of this
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
project on the energy portion being
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
well over market
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
so 100 million dollars was there to say
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
if it gets above 100 million dollars
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
money would be returned to customers
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
through a reduction in the energy price
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
over the following 12 months and do you
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
believe they could operate once they get
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
beyond the cap and get to the point
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion is not if it's 56 or
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
55 or 58 or 80 million dollars over a
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
12-year period that they'd be operating
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
at a loss for every megawatt hour they
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
produce and
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
no one that's rational would probably do
 
04:53:24.240 --> 04:53:25.190 align:start position:0%
no one that's rational would probably do
that

04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i think a different question
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps is what would happen if they
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
were at 2 million or 3 million or 4
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
million over the cap because that's a
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
lot smaller amount and and i mentioned
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
it earlier but
 
04:53:39.120 --> 04:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
it earlier but
the

04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
wreck prices are uh
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
basically there as the missing money for
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
traditional power plant generation and
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
what it costs for them to run in a
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
market versus a renewable project this
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
is a class one renewable project
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
and so it gets four hundred thousand
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
wrecks per year those four hundred
 
04:54:02.550 --> 04:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
thousand wrecks per year basically bring
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
in 20 to 22 23 million dollars per year
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:54:13.280 --> 04:54:14.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
uh

04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative i mean uh mr franz
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate said that it would be
 
04:54:21.280 --> 04:54:22.628 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate said that it would be
simply

04:54:22.628 --> 04:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
simply
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
profoundly unfair
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
for the general court to retroactively
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
overrule a puc decision
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
what do you think the long-term
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
consequences of that happening could be
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm not an attorney as mr crease is
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i have a high regard for his
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
legal capabilities but
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
in general just as someone who's been in
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
the regulatory world for a very long
 
04:54:48.550 --> 04:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
time now
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a very good idea to
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
keep going back and overturning
 
04:54:56.550 --> 04:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
puc decisions i think that sends
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainty to all the players that are
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
involved at the puc
 
04:55:01.680 --> 04:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
involved at the puc
and

04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
it may help someone at one point but it
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
may hurt them at another point and i
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
think certainty is fairly important to
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
markets and
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
actors that are that appear before the
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
puc there is a process at the puc
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and someone can ask for ask file a
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
motion for a hearing or clarification
 
04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they have the appeal rights to go to
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court if they
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
really think the puc got it wrong okay
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie fitz
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr france
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
back again
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
um good to see you
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
04:55:41.910 --> 04:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
what would be or what do you believe
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
might be the impact
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
of this plant
 
04:55:49.830 --> 04:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
closing its doors
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
would that money be recoverable should
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
they declare bankruptcy
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
and what would be the
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
effect on the rates of the people of new
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it would be a war it'd be
 
04:56:01.600 --> 04:56:02.788 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it would be a war it'd be
gone

04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
gone
 
04:56:05.190 --> 04:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
um do you have any inkling what that
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:56:06.320 --> 04:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
might be
uh

04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
i i i don't think if they don't run that
 
04:56:14.550 --> 04:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
the customers and ratepayers in new
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire will see that
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
56 million dollars with 156 million
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that have been over market from
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the power year till
 
04:56:23.840 --> 04:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the power year till
today

04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time if the plant closes
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
customers will also not be paying
 
04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
the wreck prices
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
also so
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
and class one wrecks
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the market today
 
04:56:40.320 --> 04:56:41.030 align:start position:0%
in the market today
are

04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
substantially less than what what the
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
customers of eversource are paying for
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
those class one
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
wrecks under the ppa the ppa price is
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know around 53 to 55 dollars per
 
04:56:54.878 --> 04:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know around 53 to 55 dollars per
rec

04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
rec
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh you can go out and purchase class one
 
04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
wrecks in the market
 
04:57:00.320 --> 04:57:01.510 align:start position:0%
wrecks in the market
they

04:57:01.510 --> 04:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since i looked but
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
they were trading around fifteen to
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars per class one record for
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rex a while back so
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
a savings from that perspective
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna file to put that
 
04:57:15.920 --> 04:57:17.190 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna file to put that
in

04:57:17.190 --> 04:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
simplistic terms for me
 
04:57:20.798 --> 04:57:21.830 align:start position:0%
simplistic terms for me
if

04:57:21.830 --> 04:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
this plant closes
 
04:57:26.070 --> 04:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
money's not returned because it can't be
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't not collectible
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
and the timing right now is bad because
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
of what the
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
situation is with power in general
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
and fuel
 
04:57:42.480 --> 04:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
and fuel
what

04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
do you estimate would be the actual
 
04:57:47.840 --> 04:57:49.110 align:start position:0%
do you estimate would be the actual
effect

04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:57:50.550 --> 04:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
on me
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
the customer am i gonna see
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
a three cent increase in my bill or a
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
two cent decrease in my bill
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's very simplistic but that
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
according to what things are now
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
there are assumptions built into that
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
but let's assume that
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
we'll follow your assumption and that
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
the plan closes the money that's already
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
paid doesn't come back that's some cost
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
some costs
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
are are costs that we really as
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
economists don't worry too much about
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're gone
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
on going forward uh
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
this plant
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
despite being the fourth largest in new
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and produces a fair amount of
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
output is small and as far as even new
 
04:58:35.590 --> 04:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire has
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
almost 4 000 megawatts of installed
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
generation the region has 31 000
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
megawatts of install generation on the
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
margin it would have a very very small
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
effect on the overall clearing price
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or in the region that's
 
04:58:51.280 --> 04:58:52.948 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or in the region that's
clear

04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
you'd replace the 400 000 wrecks
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
that are purchased by eversource with uh
 
04:59:02.550 --> 04:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits probably from
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
the market at a much lower price there'd
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
be savings there and this will have
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh and you won't be paying the price for
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
the ppa for energy and that energy price
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
is about 73 to 75 dollars per megawatt
 
04:59:18.550 --> 04:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
hour right now
 
04:59:18.560 --> 04:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
hour right now
um

04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
the eversource files with the puc on an
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
through its strain of costs what the
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
over market costs of the purchase
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
facility are in 2019 the over market
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
costs one could argue with it but the
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
over market costs were 41 million
 
04:59:35.600 --> 04:59:37.430 align:start position:0%
over market costs were 41 million
dollars

04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
if that's lower today because of higher
 
04:59:39.600 --> 04:59:40.550 align:start position:0%
if that's lower today because of higher
prices

04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
prices
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're still probably talking about
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
over market costs of anywhere from 25 to
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars that's that's about
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
four mils per kilowatt hour
 
04:59:53.350 --> 04:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
on a a on a bill and a reduction in
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
stranded costs four mils per kilowatt
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
hour times 650 you're talking about two
 
04:59:59.590 --> 04:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifty cents perhaps as much
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
as three dollars per month on a
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
residential bill back
 
05:00:06.070 --> 05:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
that that's return or is that spent
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
that would be money you would save on
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
your bill about three dollars a month
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
maybe it could be
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
two it could be 250 but it's in that
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
range about two bucks yep thank you two
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
to three two three is the plant's power
 
05:00:17.600 --> 05:00:21.830 align:start position:0%
to three two three is the plant's power
undervalued

05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
by whom
 
05:00:23.760 --> 05:00:24.948 align:start position:0%
by whom
uh

05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's a contractual price that
 
05:00:30.150 --> 05:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
people at the time thought was
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative of what future market
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
prices were and was fair in the uh going
 
05:00:38.550 --> 05:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
forward and met the public interest
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
it's easy in hindsight to say
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
how things turned out
 
05:00:42.718 --> 05:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
how things turned out
uh

05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
honestly things turned out a lot like
 
05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
what a puc colleague of mine testified
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
in that proceeding
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
he testified that this project would
 
05:00:52.638 --> 05:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
he testified that this project would
would

05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:00:53.520 --> 05:00:54.310 align:start position:0%
would
be

05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
way way way
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
over market
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
create a lot of
 
05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
additional costs for customers that
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
colleague is george mccluskey who just
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
retired he was also
 
05:01:06.878 --> 05:01:07.590 align:start position:0%
retired he was also
our

05:01:07.590 --> 05:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
lead expert in wholesale markets at iso
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
new england
 
05:01:11.440 --> 05:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
new england
um

05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think if you went to market today
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
and negotiated a ppa for this price for
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
this power
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
it would not be at
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
75 a megawatt hour um and it would not
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
be it
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion at 55
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
per wreck
 
05:01:33.190 --> 05:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
the capacity has been
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually a winner at times for customers
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
and even the energy during certain
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
periods of time it's it's it's
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly been a winner also this past
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
winter is a good example of that there
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
are many hours i'm sure as
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
the folks behind me could tell you that
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
they ran
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the money for
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
eversource customers when we had many
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
many many hours this winter of above
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 per megawatt-hour clearing
 
05:02:02.240 --> 05:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 per megawatt-hour clearing
prices

05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
prices
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
in iceland england spot market
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
that'll probably also be true next
 
05:02:07.360 --> 05:02:08.868 align:start position:0%
that'll probably also be true next
winter

05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
winter
 
05:02:08.878 --> 05:02:09.990 align:start position:0%
winter
however

05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
this plant runs at a 92 capacity factor
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that's a whole lot of hours where
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
the clearing price is in the 30s and 40s
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
and 50s and the market price of the
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
power under the ppa is in the 70s
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
representatives samsung has a question
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
mr france for
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
05:02:31.440 --> 05:02:32.470 align:start position:0%
for being here
um

05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:32.480 --> 05:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm still a little
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
fuzzy about the problem at hand
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard testimony from the people
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
from burgess who said
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
they will this will not increase rates
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
at all and they are not going to be
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
asking for any more money in the future
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
you just confirmed that
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
there is no request through this bill
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
for an increase in the rates
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
but you also said that
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't solve the problem
 
05:03:02.080 --> 05:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
that doesn't solve the problem
so

05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:05.190 --> 05:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
can you really flesh out a little bit
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
for me what is the problem actually
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the problem is that this
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
is a ppa that has a
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
market price for power for energy i'm
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
not talking about the wrecks i'm not
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
talking about capacity i'm talking about
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
just the energy the megawatt hours
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
delivered to eversource
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
that is at a price that
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
for many many many hours of the year
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
appears above what the nodal price in
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
northern new hampshire clears at
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
and that difference
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
creates and and goes toward the excess
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
of over the hundred million dollars of
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction factor and
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
under the ppa unless the ppa is to be
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
changed and agreed to by numerous
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
parties including eversource and burgess
 
05:03:50.240 --> 05:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
parties including eversource and burgess
that

05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
money needs to be returned under the ppa
 
05:03:54.638 --> 05:03:55.590 align:start position:0%
money needs to be returned under the ppa
following

05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the following power year
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
so that let's say that it's
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
an additional five million dollars over
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
over market the way it's calculated that
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
5 million gets returned over the next 12
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
months in the following power year which
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
reduces the
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
power price
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
of that ppa
 
05:04:13.840 --> 05:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
of that ppa
now

05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
if it's one or two million every year
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps they keep running
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and and they
 
05:04:21.840 --> 05:04:22.868 align:start position:0%
and and and they
they

05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
eat the lower price of energy instead of
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
selling at seventy five dollars make it
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour maybe they sell at 70 or
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
72 dollars per megawatt hour
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
if that number is
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
too large as it is based on senate bill
 
05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:39.750 align:start position:0%
too large as it is based on senate bill
577

05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
577
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's no way that they really can run
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
because they're just going to lose
 
05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of money and i seriously
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
doubt the investors would appreciate
 
05:04:48.718 --> 05:04:50.150 align:start position:0%
doubt the investors would appreciate
that

05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:50.160 --> 05:04:51.670 align:start position:0%
that
okay

05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:54.150 --> 05:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
i would like to move on because
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
five more people who would like to speak
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
and uh what i'm going to do right now is
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
open a public hearing on senate bill 321
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
and recess that hearing
 
05:05:11.590 --> 05:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
until we finish this hearing the
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
previous hearing on 271.
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
bring forward a
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
another public official
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i want to apologize to
 
05:05:28.470 --> 05:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
paul grenier for uh
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
not bringing him to the table
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
more promptly
 
05:05:32.560 --> 05:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
more promptly

but i would like to have him come talk
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%

05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:05:50.230 --> 05:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
so this is the mayor of berlin paul
 
05:05:50.240 --> 05:06:00.070 align:start position:0%
so this is the mayor of berlin paul
grenier

05:06:00.070 --> 05:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
name is paul grenier and i recently took
 
05:06:08.070 --> 05:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
my oath of office to serve as a seventh
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
term as berlin's mayor
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
i rise today in support of uh senate
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill 271 for a variety of reasons
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
the future economic survival of my city
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
depends on the continued operation of
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
burgess biopower
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps this sounds a bit dramatic but
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's how critically important burgess
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
biopower is to the city
 
05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
our economy in berlin is unlike that of
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
any other large
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
any other city or large town in our
 
05:06:36.080 --> 05:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
any other city or large town in our
state

05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:06:39.430 --> 05:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
every population center in new hampshire
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
has either an interstate or four-lane
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
connector highway
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
within 10 miles of their border
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
i-93 the closest to berlin is 50 miles
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
away and must navigate franconia notch
 
05:06:52.080 --> 05:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
away and must navigate franconia notch
parkway

05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
parkway
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
this really limits berlin's ability to
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
grow its economy and attract the young
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
people so vital to our area
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm here to tell you we've begun to
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
do just that
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
when i was first sworn in as mayor in
 
05:07:05.200 --> 05:07:07.110 align:start position:0%
when i was first sworn in as mayor in
2010

05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
2010
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
broome was hanging by a thread the
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
bureau of prisons facility in berlin
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
have not yet been built
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
the pulp mill has been closed for three
 
05:07:15.120 --> 05:07:16.150 align:start position:0%
the pulp mill has been closed for three
years

05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the gorham paper mill was in
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy and not operating without
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
good prospects at home our best and
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
brightest citizens
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
were forced to seek work elsewhere
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
leaving a community they loved in order
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
to raise their families
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
but then burgess biopower came along
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
burgess and berlin burgess was berlin's
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
first real economic development success
 
05:07:40.948 --> 05:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
story in 40 years
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
and at the time was enthusiastically
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
supported by the state
 
05:07:46.000 --> 05:07:46.830 align:start position:0%
supported by the state
then

05:07:46.830 --> 05:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
psnh local governments and businesses
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
many of the young people hired during
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
construction are still working in the
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
building trades or have found various
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
vocations they learned while at burgess
 
05:08:00.550 --> 05:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
and many have stayed in berlin as a
 
05:08:00.560 --> 05:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
and many have stayed in berlin as a
result

05:08:02.550 --> 05:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
result
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
at a time when berlin desperately needed
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
it burgess biopower provided economic
 
05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
stability good long-term employment and
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps most importantly a spark of hope
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
that the city could thrive once again we
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
no longer have the luxury of being able
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
to withstand another human exodus
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
if once again we have to rebuild our
 
05:08:22.958 --> 05:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
if once again we have to rebuild our
economy

05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
economy
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
property values are rising large
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
businesses like white mountain paper
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
company north country growers are
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
investing in our community
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
and brilliant has become an outdoor
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
recreation destination for thousands of
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
visitors each year
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
but none of this would be possible
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
without burgess as an economic anchor
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
the financial impact burgess has on the
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
city of berlin is significant
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
burgess accounts for nearly 12 percent
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
of our real estate taxes
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
for blowing water works the impact on a
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
percentage basis is even greater
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
burgess from fees from burgess total 25
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
percent of their revenue which covers
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
broad waterworks annual debt service
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
equally important is the fact that
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
burgess keeps our working forests
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
healthy and available for recreation
 
05:09:11.520 --> 05:09:12.868 align:start position:0%
healthy and available for recreation
activities

05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
by creating a market for low-grade wood
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
losing burgess would cause tax and water
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
rates to skyrocket community confidence
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
to plummet
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
and could very well place berlin in a
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
receivership the death spiral of any
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
community begins with realization
 
05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
that the future is bleak at best
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
in closing on behalf of my city the
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
communities that surround berlin and the
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
forest land owners in coast county in
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
i plead with you to recommend passage of
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
271 a unanimous vote from this committee
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
the continued revelance of our area is
 
05:09:50.550 --> 05:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
truly at stake
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and if you look in the packet
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't like giving testimony to
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
any committee in the legislature
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
without giving you some background
 
05:10:00.320 --> 05:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
without giving you some background
information

05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i gave you the dra breakdown of our
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
tax rate our tax rate is 36.54
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
so you take two million dollars out of
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue out of the city
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
i gave you the proposed uh waterworks
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
budget and you can see that in fact
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
burgess is 25
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the water works budget
 
05:10:29.360 --> 05:10:30.708 align:start position:0%
of the water works budget
and

05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
at the very end i kept my
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
testimony from senate bill 577 which
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
really digs into the weeds
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
of why we were here in the first place
 
05:10:42.798 --> 05:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
of why we were here in the first place
and

05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
i know there are a lot of smart people
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
in this room and i know there's a lot of
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
people here
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
who will try to work out a solution to
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
try to make this work
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
burgess is very very important to the
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
city it's important to me as mayor
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm very proud of my relationship with
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
the folks who run the power plant
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
no community should be so lucky as to
 
05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
have people of burgess's magnitude in
 
05:11:14.550 --> 05:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
their backyard they've been great
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%

drew klein president of the josiah
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
bartlett center we're in new hampshire's
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
free market think tank i'm just going to
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
stray from my notes here for the
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
interest of time and say that what we
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
really have here in the purchase power
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
agreement is a jobs program it is a jobs
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy it is not
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
a it is not an energy issue this isn't
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
about energy this is about jobs it's
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
about protecting the timber industry
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's been clear from the very
 
05:12:28.560 --> 05:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
that's been clear from the very
beginning

05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
05:12:32.070 --> 05:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
the wrong way to do that is to raise
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
electricity rates on new hampshire
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
ratepayers the the problem is you have a
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
couple of different issues here that
 
05:12:38.708 --> 05:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
you're trying to solve you're trying to
 
05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
solve a reduction in timber industry
 
05:12:40.400 --> 05:12:41.350 align:start position:0%
solve a reduction in timber industry
jobs

05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
05:12:41.360 --> 05:12:42.628 align:start position:0%
jobs
the

05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
disappearance of the market for pulpwood
 
05:12:48.150 --> 05:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
and your and um you know berlin's
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
economic issues those are the three
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
things you're really trying to solve
 
05:12:51.360 --> 05:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
things you're really trying to solve
with

05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
a biomass plant but the biomass plan is
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
not the right way to solve those
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
problems so you're forcing rate payers
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
to subsidize a biomass plant as a
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
through path to subsidizing timber
 
05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
industry jobs that's what this scheme is
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
05:13:07.920 --> 05:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
is doing
um

05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the bartlett center opposes all such
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
subsidies and also schemes no industry
 
05:13:15.430 --> 05:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
should get a subsidy from the state
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
subsidize an industry you don't do it by
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
raising the already the seventh highest
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
electricity prices we we are in the top
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
seven right now we're usually in the top
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
five so you're literally making grandma
 
05:13:31.830 --> 05:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're making low-income families you're
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
making um other folks pay higher
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
electricity rates so you heard estimated
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
money today that it's about two to three
 
05:13:37.920 --> 05:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
money today that it's about two to three
dollars

05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:13:39.040 --> 05:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
increased monthly cost that's that's
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
upwards of 360 dollars for a family a
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
year to subsidize timber industry jobs
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
right that's not the right way to do it
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you're going to subsidize timber
 
05:13:54.868 --> 05:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
industry jobs 30 seconds then
 
05:13:54.878 --> 05:13:55.750 align:start position:0%
industry jobs 30 seconds then
okay

05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:58.390 --> 05:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
36 okay sorry uh misspoke a little
 
05:13:58.400 --> 05:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
36 okay sorry uh misspoke a little
different

05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:13:59.360 --> 05:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
different
um

05:14:01.590 --> 05:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
we've already spent 158 million dollars
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
the plant costs 275 million dollars to
 
05:14:08.400 --> 05:14:09.270 align:start position:0%
the plant costs 275 million dollars to
build

05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
build
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
right we've almost bought the plant
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
by overpayment rate payers have
 
05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be subsidizing this if you
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to extend the 12-month period at
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
which they need to pay back the 58
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's a better option
 
05:14:24.240 --> 05:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's a better option
than

05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
um the language in the bill seems to
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that that puc has vague broad
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
powers to do whatever it wants you need
 
05:14:32.550 --> 05:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
to narrow it down give them a longer
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
time to pay this back that's the right
 
05:14:34.560 --> 05:14:36.390 align:start position:0%
time to pay this back that's the right
option

05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much any questions
 
05:14:38.480 --> 05:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much any questions
for

05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:14:41.110 --> 05:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
mr klein
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam and thank you
 
05:14:44.948 --> 05:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative uh oxford for the math
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
if you could just repeat your last
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
sentence because it was
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
i think exactly to the point but i it
 
05:14:59.430 --> 05:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
went by really too fast for me i'm sorry
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
i was flying so fast i'm not even sure
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
what my last sentence was
 
05:15:02.480 --> 05:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
what my last sentence was
um

05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
it was kind of your proposal of how we
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
would right right so if you're
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
like so so the issue is the cliff as
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
senator bradley said you got 58 million
 
05:15:14.708 --> 05:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
dollars to pay back in 12 months i'm not
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
sure why that can't be changed to extend
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
that payment period
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that it's not all falling in one year
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
another option would be uh you know
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
instead of forcing rate payers to pay
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
this the irs has had a checkbox for
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
years for the presidential campaign fund
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
you could put a check box on on rate on
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
bills to say
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
do you want to pay three dollars a month
 
05:15:38.550 --> 05:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
to subsidize this plan and let
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
ratepayers choose right that's better
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
than forcing them to do that
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
so anyway okay thank you thank you very
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
much all right all right let's move on
 
05:15:48.480 --> 05:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
much all right all right let's move on
next

05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
will be kristen koch from the business
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
ms coke i'm going to have to give you
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
but i know you have written testimony so
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
that will help yes no problem
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
i'm so good afternoon mr chair members
 
05:16:10.150 --> 05:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is kirsten koch
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm the director of public policy
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
for bia
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to express bia's concerns
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
regarding senate bill 271 while baa
 
05:16:20.470 --> 05:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
supports economic development in general
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
we do not believe that it should come at
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
such a significant cost for rate payers
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 271 potentially sets up rate
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
payers to face a large increase in the
 
05:16:30.000 --> 05:16:31.110 align:start position:0%
payers to face a large increase in the
future

05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:16:33.350 --> 05:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill artificially inflates energy
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
prices for the benefit of a single
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
business and establishes that unless
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
covered by federal covet 19 relief funds
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the costs would be fully recovered from
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
rate payers the core responsibility of
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire public utilities
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
commission is to protect the interest of
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
the rate payers but senate bill 271
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
attempts to override the puc's authority
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
in this instance
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
the bia respectfully requests the
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee to find senate bill 271
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you for
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
such a significant expense to rate
 
05:17:15.600 --> 05:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
such a significant expense to rate
payers

05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
payers
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
are you in agreement with the preceding
 
05:17:21.190 --> 05:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
speaker that we're talking
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
up 36
 
05:17:24.310 --> 05:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
a year
 
05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
increase a three two to three dollar
 
05:17:26.560 --> 05:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
increase a three two to three dollar
increase

05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
on a bill per month per rate payer
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i'm talking
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
about the additional 20 million dollars
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
per year that eversource ratepayers
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:17:38.080 --> 05:17:39.670 align:start position:0%
would be
facing

05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
facing
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
so all the ratepayers paying that amount
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
of money comes to
 
05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
a significant amount but it's not a
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
significant amount for the ratepayer
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
no debates just questions thank you
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me okay thank you very much
 
05:17:56.070 --> 05:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm a bit confused because i i
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
thought there would be no additional
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
charges to the ratepayers so i would
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
ask you if you could
 
05:18:06.160 --> 05:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
ask you if you could
um

05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:07.280 --> 05:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
um
give

05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
us as a committee
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
where your figures came from by tuesday
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
because i believe this will be on the
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
docket for tuesday
 
05:18:19.830 --> 05:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
are we going to exact this on tuesday
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh next tuesday the 19th so if if by the
 
05:18:26.550 --> 05:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
end of the week on monday maybe you
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
could uh forward how you calculated
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
your figures as an increase for the
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
attack the ratepayers because i don't
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
i've heard more testimony that there
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be no increase
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um there
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be an increase and this is about
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
when burgess sells energy at an above
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
market rate that's when the
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
ratepayers are forced to subsidize it
 
05:18:56.550 --> 05:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.560 --> 05:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
next up is jason stock and jason i know
 
05:19:06.550 --> 05:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
you have
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
a ton that you could say about this
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
subject but
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
please give us your
 
05:19:11.120 --> 05:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
please give us your
best

05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
best
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
we love paper mills
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
all right well yesterday i was at 2 37
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jason stock
 
05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive director of the new
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire timberland owners association
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot today about timber
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
forestry and i wanted to just kind of
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
put a couple things in context i'm
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
providing you a copy of our testimony we
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
provided to the senate on this bill
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
it has some has a couple economic
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
analysis in it you can pour over that at
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
your leisure but i wanted to just put a
 
05:20:04.150 --> 05:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
couple things like i said in context
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
in may 2020 there was a a forest
 
05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
economic analysis looking at the entire
 
05:20:10.000 --> 05:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
economic analysis looking at the entire
state

05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the total forest products industry is
 
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
about 2.5 billion dollars in economic
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
activity this is not an insignificant
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
little boutique industry
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're the second most forested state in
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
the nation and two-thirds of all that's
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
growing out there on our landscape is
 
05:20:30.948 --> 05:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
low-grade it's junk wood it can't be
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
turned into a a two by four it can't be
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
turned into veneer
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty to look at when you leaf
 
05:20:40.310 --> 05:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
peep et cetera but it's it is for all
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes and from a
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
landowner's perspective or a land
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
manager's perspective it's wood that's
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
consuming valuable air space in that
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
annually about 2500 timber sales occur
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
almost every town in the state even
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth occasionally has timber
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
harvest so this is a statewide issue and
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
annually we cut about 2.5 million tons
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
of wood all species all products
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
firewood saw logs and yes biomass
 
05:21:17.520 --> 05:21:18.390 align:start position:0%
firewood saw logs and yes biomass
and

05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
so when you hear 800 000 green tons put
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
that in context of 2.5 million all cut
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
across the state it's a big piece of the
 
05:21:28.000 --> 05:21:28.948 align:start position:0%
across the state it's a big piece of the
pie

05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
pie
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
it is a very big piece of the pie
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
when we lost the existing biomass power
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
plants that was about 1.3 million
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
tons so the forest products industry has
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
taken a pretty good shot the last couple
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
years in our low grade markets
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
folks are scrambling
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen contraction and logging in
 
05:21:49.680 --> 05:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
we've seen contraction and logging in
infrastructure

05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the impacts are even 30 seconds 30
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
seconds gotcha impacts are even
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
trickling down to solid wood sawmills
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
having difficulty managing their waste
 
05:22:04.150 --> 05:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
and having difficulty procuring saw logs
 
05:22:05.430 --> 05:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
05:22:05.440 --> 05:22:07.110 align:start position:0%
because of the
capacity

05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
just wrap up i'm going to use my last 25
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
and a half seconds here to wrap up and
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
just say yesterday in the renewable
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
energy renewable gas bill we had a
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
pretty good discussion
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
about looking forward and looking
 
05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
prospectively and looking at
 
05:22:22.558 --> 05:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
prospectively and looking at
opportunities

05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
05:22:24.080 --> 05:22:25.030 align:start position:0%
opportunities
forward

05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
um senator thomas and senator vote
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
signed on to a bill to house bill 1005
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
to look forward
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
looking at opportunities for low-grade
 
05:22:35.360 --> 05:22:36.868 align:start position:0%
looking at opportunities for low-grade
markets

05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
markets
 
05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
if we lose capacity if we lose
 
05:22:39.200 --> 05:22:40.948 align:start position:0%
if we lose capacity if we lose
infrastructure

05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
it gets very difficult to encourage
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
someone to come to the state and say hey
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
we're a state we support forest products
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
we support the industry
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
and if there is if there if the logging
 
05:22:55.990 --> 05:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and land management capacity is
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
a fraction of what it is today it gets
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do that so this is
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
this all kind of fits together we we
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
need to maintain that capacity and that
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
critical mass
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to ask jason any
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions at this point because we've
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
asked him
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds over the course of the last
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
couple of years but we appreciate your
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
testimony and thanks for this written uh
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
testimony too that's all right what a
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
great information for what is good thank
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay the last word on this
 
05:23:27.840 --> 05:23:28.708 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay the last word on this

05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
name wrong

shayla connolly of holderness thank you
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
did i get that right it's just sheila
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah gila oh it's a little gaelic trick
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
and sheila represents rmi which you're
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to tell us what that is right yes
 
05:23:55.680 --> 05:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
going to tell us what that is right yes
sir

05:23:57.270 --> 05:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
so sheila conley from resource
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
management inc rmi is my company with my
 
05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
partner charlie who's handing out
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
information for you and the last word of
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
the day is wood ash
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
so charlie is giving you samples of wood
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
ash this is what is generated as one of
 
05:24:13.520 --> 05:24:14.708 align:start position:0%
ash this is what is generated as one of
the

05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
other green products that comes from the
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
plant so it's not just green electricity
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's black wood ash this is black gold
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is a potassium fertilizer that is
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
used throughout new hampshire for farms
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
to grow crops
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
potash is scarce
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's even more scarce now due to the
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
horrific situation in ukraine and russia
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
that is one of the major sources of
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
potash in in the uh agricultural world
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
so um i just to to give you a little
 
05:24:47.990 --> 05:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
background i've been recycling wood ash
 
05:24:48.000 --> 05:24:48.830 align:start position:0%
background i've been recycling wood ash
since

05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
1988. i was around when these first
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
biomass plants were
 
05:24:55.590 --> 05:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
built and up and running
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i was there when burgess began and
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've been recycling a hundred percent
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
of their ash ever since
 
05:25:03.590 --> 05:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
our company is located in holderness new
 
05:25:03.600 --> 05:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
our company is located in holderness new
hampshire

05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
we have 30 employees
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we have an environmental commitment
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
as a small business to do the right
 
05:25:11.200 --> 05:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
as a small business to do the right
thing

05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
we work with farms several hundred farms
 
05:25:15.910 --> 05:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the northeast
 
05:25:15.920 --> 05:25:16.788 align:start position:0%
throughout the northeast
and

05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
the loss of this potash to those farmers
 
05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
would be tremendous
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
i just
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't even begin to explain how
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
difficult it is to be a farm these days
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the wood ash provides relief because
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's cost effective it's local and it's
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
really really good for growing their
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
crops i'll just point out that these
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
other sources of power you can't spread
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
seabrook's leftovers on farms you can't
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
spread the coal ash on farms but you can
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
spread this really beautiful wood ash on
 
05:25:50.240 --> 05:25:51.670 align:start position:0%
spread this really beautiful wood ash on
farms

05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
farms
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
so you know we've lost the biomass plant
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
in bethlehem we've lost the biomass
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
plant in alexandria we are
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the springfield plant will
 
05:26:03.910 --> 05:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
run more than not it has been running
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we're recycling their ash the
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
tamworth plant is up and running a
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
little bit we're hoping that they'll
 
05:26:11.590 --> 05:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
stay around um
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to close with i i agree with
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
all of the things talked about earlier
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the benefits of this but i
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
just i don't so much think of these as
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
power plants i think of a more as an
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
economic hub
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
with spokes that support the forest
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
products industry local truck mechanics
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
local restaurants
 
05:26:35.670 --> 05:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
gas stations trail users
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
and farmers
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't use the word subsidy i use
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
the word investment
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
and you did get the last word and uh we
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing us that uh
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
fine gift as well
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to close the
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill 271
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
you can put in about a four inch pot and
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's really good for cherry tomatoes
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay and i'll ask mr chairman i'll ask
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
for uh representative white to give us
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet total
 
05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
chairman can i inquire i think there was
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
reference made to to uh eversource
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
testifying are they not going to testify
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
they did not sign up to testify now okay
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
i thought they were going to clarify
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that came up
 
05:27:26.788 --> 05:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
i've looked through all the pink cards
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
up here and i don't see one from
 
05:27:28.000 --> 05:27:29.830 align:start position:0%
up here and i don't see one from
eversource

05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
05:27:29.840 --> 05:27:31.110 align:start position:0%
eversource
okay

05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:31.120 --> 05:27:33.190 align:start position:0%
okay
so

05:27:33.190 --> 05:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
we will now
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing that i started
 
05:27:37.920 --> 05:27:39.310 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing that i started
about

05:27:39.310 --> 05:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
25 minutes ago on senate bill 371 and
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
ask senator david waters the prime
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to present the bill
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
to us
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
so once again
 
05:27:53.270 --> 05:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
right before you start uh i'd like to
 
05:27:55.350 --> 05:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
get representative white to tell us
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
about the blue sheet on the last bill
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
all right uh blue sheet we've got online
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
we have 39 support
 
05:28:05.830 --> 05:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
10 opposed and then we have five support
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
and two posts
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's all yours
 
05:28:19.750 --> 05:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm playing ping-pong today
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm bouncing from here into here and
 
05:28:24.390 --> 05:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of the 10-year
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
highway plan down in transportation so
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm glad i made it up here i know you've
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
had a busy day so i'll try to be
 
05:28:32.548 --> 05:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
brief i'm senator david waters
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill
 
05:28:34.798 --> 05:28:36.070 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill
3

05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
3
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
21. and um
 
05:28:40.548 --> 05:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill tries to update
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
what we have done now for quite some
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
time first in 1979 and then again in
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
1998 in terms of net metering in new
 
05:28:48.958 --> 05:28:50.548 align:start position:0%
1998 in terms of net metering in new
hampshire

05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
and also the progress that we certainly
 
05:28:54.548 --> 05:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
made over the last year or so
 
05:28:54.558 --> 05:28:55.430 align:start position:0%
made over the last year or so
um

05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
and you know a lot of questions have
 
05:28:59.590 --> 05:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
risen over the years that we've been
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
endeavoring uh in to do this um
 
05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know how can we enable market-based
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives to that metering
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then specifically how do we avoid
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
a rate payer
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
across subsidies or cost shiftings and
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's of course been a great uh area of
 
05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
interest for this committee and for all
 
05:29:20.230 --> 05:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:29:22.390 --> 05:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so one of the
 
05:29:24.310 --> 05:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
ways to address that was try to enable
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
in-state distributed generation and
 
05:29:27.990 --> 05:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
storage of less than five
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
megawatts that produce power for sale
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
and resale to new hampshire customers
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
and how do we let that be accurately
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
credited and
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
so you get into credit because you're
 
05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
not increasing
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
cost shifting
 
05:29:43.030 --> 05:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill builds on what was passed
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
last year in senate bill 91 and part
 
05:29:45.280 --> 05:29:47.350 align:start position:0%
last year in senate bill 91 and part
four

05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know after that the
 
05:29:49.840 --> 05:29:50.788 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know after that the
house

05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to study uh mr chairman we had
 
05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
the committee last
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
summer on
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
the issue of cost shifting and and leap
 
05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
and uh that was i thought really you
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
know a terrific
 
05:30:03.990 --> 05:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
and compressed uh
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
study of of the issues and a great
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
report that you
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
um put put together and the question
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
kept coming up um okay
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
well what happens if someone removed
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
themselves from just from distribution
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh from iso
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
new england and uh if you're if you do
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
that would it not mean that you are not
 
05:30:26.320 --> 05:30:27.510 align:start position:0%
that would it not mean that you are not
cost

05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:30:27.520 --> 05:30:28.788 align:start position:0%
cost
shifting

05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
and um so the bill tries to clarify
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
that it's it is kind of a what if if we
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
did this to ensure
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they were out of that system
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
then not cost shifting
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know as i was working on this in
 
05:30:48.868 --> 05:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill and remembering
 
05:30:51.270 --> 05:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know the efforts we made in the leap
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee about wanting to be cautious
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
these issues are getting studied
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that if we brought anything forward
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
it ought to be a pilot program
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill does and i will
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
point to a few things in the first page
 
05:31:05.520 --> 05:31:06.310 align:start position:0%
point to a few things in the first page
here

05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
and really all follow us from that and
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
then i just as soon after that let um
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
mr bilo uh take it from there
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
so i took it on page one of the bill
 
05:31:20.548 --> 05:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
um here is where we get at it on line
 
05:31:20.558 --> 05:31:21.670 align:start position:0%
um here is where we get at it on line
six

05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:31:23.590 --> 05:31:23.600 align:start position:0%

05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
metering non-participation and net
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
energy metering may be achieved
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
by cancelling participation and such
 
05:31:33.270 --> 05:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
upon assuming limited production
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
b is not registered as a generator asset
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
or network resource within iso new
 
05:31:43.350 --> 05:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
england that's key
 
05:31:46.390 --> 05:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
c does not otherwise participate in any
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
ferc jurisdictional wholesale
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
electricity markets
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
except as an alternative technology
 
05:31:55.190 --> 05:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
regulation resource
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
to the extent
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
atrs are deemed by iso new england to
 
05:32:03.670 --> 05:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
function as retail or network oil
 
05:32:03.680 --> 05:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
function as retail or network oil
reducers

05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
reducers
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
for all other iso new england such
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
non-participation and ferc
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional interstate wholesale
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
markets may be achieved by retirement
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
from such markets
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
so there it is it takes the premise that
 
05:32:20.310 --> 05:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
was developed
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
um you know arising out of our
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience of that metering and was
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in the leap and says okay this
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
is this is a bill that would do that
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
help not shift costs and also enable the
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
communities that are interested in doing
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
this and the producers are interested
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
into it to be able to go ahead and make
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
their investments in their and their
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
now mr chairman i just i just said to
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
start you know i is we've had a lot of
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
conversations about this over the last
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
couple years haven't we and it's just
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's fascinating you know things are
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
changing and um
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to tell the leader i
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot there we don't know
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but i think that a pilot makes a lot
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
of sense and i don't know i do know my
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with you that you did
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
comment as well if it's really a pilot
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
why aren't there end dates and so on and
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you and i didn't really
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
think in those ways because we kind of
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
said was going to be one you know one
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
some people can get together with just
 
05:33:16.310 --> 05:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know utility and so on but i think
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
it would uh in the spirit of pilots
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
which i really respect from the leap
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
committee report if you thought that it
 
05:33:24.310 --> 05:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
would uh make sense to say okay let's
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
really make it a pilot put some dates
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
and some other kinds of guardrails
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
around it
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
i want to honor the kind of agreement we
 
05:33:33.030 --> 05:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
all came to out of that committee last
 
05:33:35.430 --> 05:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
summer so thank you mr chairman
 
05:33:37.110 --> 05:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing the
 
05:33:37.120 --> 05:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing the
bill

05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
do we want to ask the senator questions
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
or do we want to wait and ask
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
clifton below the man who has all the
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
i guess the sense of the committee is
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to uh move on to
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the honorable clifton bilo so i will see
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
you in an hour okay well thank you in an
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
hour mr chairman members of the
 
05:33:58.558 --> 05:34:02.470 align:start position:0%
hour mr chairman members of the
committee

05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
so cliff the floor is yours
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:34:07.120 --> 05:34:10.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
committee

05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh this bill what this bill is about is
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
creating a
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
trying to pilot the idea
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
of a update uh to the limited electrical
 
05:34:22.310 --> 05:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
producer statute
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
another form of customer and community
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
choice of um local
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh power generation and storage um it is
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
a market-based alternative
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
to net metering for under 5 megawatt
 
05:34:41.120 --> 05:34:42.390 align:start position:0%
to net metering for under 5 megawatt
generators

05:34:42.390 --> 05:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
generators
 
05:34:44.170 --> 05:34:44.180 align:start position:0%
it might particularly um
 
05:34:44.180 --> 05:34:45.350 align:start position:0%
it might particularly um
[Music]

05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
fill a niche
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
um for one to five megawatt generators
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
that don't qualify for the current
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
expansion program
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
it is intended or structured
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
05:35:00.948 --> 05:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
do this without
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
any cross subsidies
 
05:35:03.360 --> 05:35:04.628 align:start position:0%
any cross subsidies
and

05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
by sending price signals that are
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
are actual market based and reflect
 
05:35:13.990 --> 05:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
actual value uh produced as actually
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
measured and documented so let me just
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
walk you through some of the
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
details about the bill um it does
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
you may remember house bill 1635 which
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier this year and you sent
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
to interim study um that representative
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
mcgee sponsored that was sort of an
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to revamp the the existing
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
362 a 2a
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
instead of doing that
 
05:35:42.310 --> 05:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
and the bill is introduced in the senate
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
tried to update that language to reflect
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of the study committee's work but
 
05:35:49.030 --> 05:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
trying to modify that part of the
 
05:35:52.708 --> 05:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
existing uh
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
statute it creates a new 362 a 2b
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's only about pilots so it takes
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
sort of that language
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
that was in the bill is introduced and
 
05:36:05.830 --> 05:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
puts it all in the context of only a
 
05:36:05.840 --> 05:36:06.868 align:start position:0%
puts it all in the context of only a
pilot

05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so starting on the first page at 20
 
05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
lines 24 through 27
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
it authorizes the puc to approve
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
one or more proposed pilots uh pursuant
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
to an adjudicated proceeding so a pilot
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
would not be approved until it went
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicated proceeding they
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to adopt rules because
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
this would not be of general application
 
05:36:31.830 --> 05:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
it does give them the ability to waive
 
05:36:34.310 --> 05:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
some existing provisions of
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
a 2a which is a parallel section that
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
exists in law today that allows a
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
limited producer
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
to sell directly
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
to a limited number of customers
 
05:36:44.638 --> 05:36:45.830 align:start position:0%
to a limited number of customers
um

05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but with some complications that
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
are a little archaic which is why i
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
think it hasn't ever come into use
 
05:36:52.320 --> 05:36:53.590 align:start position:0%
think it hasn't ever come into use
um

05:36:53.590 --> 05:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
i i would mention that the section one
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
and two of the bills that uh modified
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
definitions in the chapter they're not
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
specifically pilot but they're
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh definitions to go ahead
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and change because right now
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
in theory a limited producer could be
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
operating at exactly five megawatts
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
could be participating in iso new
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
england markets in fact they'd be
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
required to at five megawatts uh but
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
could also argue that they could sell
 
05:37:23.190 --> 05:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
under the existing 2a uh part of the
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
chapter uh which which really should not
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
be the case so
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's a helpful thing and it
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
brings uh storage which didn't really
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
exist uh when this legislation this
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
chapter was originally enacted in into
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
the definition of a limited producer
 
05:37:37.760 --> 05:37:38.628 align:start position:0%
the definition of a limited producer
um

05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
turning to the second page of the bill
 
05:37:42.240 --> 05:37:42.690 align:start position:0%
turning to the second page of the bill
um

05:37:42.690 --> 05:37:42.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:42.700 --> 05:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:37:48.310 --> 05:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
it um
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
there's a really key part here
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh which is
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
um to address the fact that
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh for any generator or storage facility
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
to participate in a potential pilot
 
05:37:59.840 --> 05:38:00.708 align:start position:0%
to participate in a potential pilot
um

05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
they would need to be making a choice
 
05:38:06.390 --> 05:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
not to participate in um
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
group net metering for instance um and
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'll just take the city of lebanon has a
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
one megawatt landfill gas energy project
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
under development now it has proved
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection agreement with liberty
 
05:38:18.000 --> 05:38:19.190 align:start position:0%
interconnection agreement with liberty
utilities

05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
right now the intent would do that with
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
groupnet metering
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we would the numbers work for that
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
project we would get paid the full
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
default service energy rate for all of
 
05:38:30.310 --> 05:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
our output to the grid uh that would
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
create a large cost to liberty utilities
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
that they would charge to default
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
service rate payers we couldn't actually
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
use it to offset the load obligation of
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
whoever supplying
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh city facilities or other members of
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
the group um the group members would
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
just kind of get a subsidy off of of
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
something of a discount off of the
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
default service rate even if they were
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
on a competitive supplier
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
like hopefully in a year or so lebanon
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
community power um whereas the pilot
 
05:39:03.270 --> 05:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
would allow that gen that same generator
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
to sell directly
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
potentially to lebanon community power
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
to serve the load of customers in the
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
community or
 
05:39:11.350 --> 05:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
directly to what otherwise might be
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
group members retail customers that
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
would want to take the power and and use
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
it to help meet their um load
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh and and we have a bunch of very large
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
users for whom we could portion it out
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
and they they would always have load in
 
05:39:25.750 --> 05:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
excess so this would just offset part of
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that load so the real issue is uh for
 
05:39:31.670 --> 05:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
their you know for instance if you know
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a termination date and if you
 
05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
put one into it you know these projects
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
typically require
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh financing that goes for a period of
 
05:39:41.190 --> 05:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
time in the case of our landfill gas
 
05:39:41.200 --> 05:39:42.788 align:start position:0%
time in the case of our landfill gas
project

05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
the portion of it that's that's uh debt
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
finance it's over 20-year uh payback
 
05:39:48.240 --> 05:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
finance it's over 20-year uh payback
period

05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
um we know the numbers now work with
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
with group net metering uh so this would
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
allow if the pilot uh ends before
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2040 which is when current
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
net metering tariffs are grandfathered
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
to uh both by statute and by puc order
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you got into group net
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
metering now you would be able to count
 
05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
on that through
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
2040. so this simply would say that if
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
if the pilot terminates before that time
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh that you could go
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
and revert back to what you otherwise
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
would have been uh
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh qualified for
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know i did have a brief conversation
 
05:40:27.750 --> 05:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
with department of energy folks that
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that was maybe something of a
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh that they should maybe have
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
to go on to whatever is in effect at
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
that time the problem with that is i
 
05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll have a pilot if if you
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
said you have to go on to something that
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it's going to be
 
05:40:41.590 --> 05:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
when you can lock into something now
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
that you know what it is and you you
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
know your numbers work with it
 
05:40:45.120 --> 05:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
know your numbers work with it
um

05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
so that that's uh
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
something to think about um
 
05:40:54.310 --> 05:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
at line seven roman four uh says each
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility may
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
propose and participate in a pilot
 
05:41:00.548 --> 05:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't contemplate that there'd
 
05:41:03.030 --> 05:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
be more than one pilot per distribution
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
utility and
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
quite honestly i've only had
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with liberty utilities and
 
05:41:08.400 --> 05:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
conversations with liberty utilities and
they're

05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:41:11.670 --> 05:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
receptive to considering a proposal that
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantees that they would
 
05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually commit to doing a pilot uh but
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're at least willing to consider it
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the other utility so
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
i would just caution that um it it may
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
be that we only get one or two um pilots
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
out of this uh you know if if we're
 
05:41:31.510 --> 05:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
lucky um
 
05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
in part because it's sort of the devil
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know versus the one you don't and
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable with the way group
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
net mirroring works now and they know
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
how to operate that this introduces some
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
new concepts although i think ultimately
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
we would be better off introducing these
 
05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
concepts and mechanisms because they
 
05:41:49.040 --> 05:41:50.548 align:start position:0%
concepts and mechanisms because they
create

05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
a market dynamic in which prices price
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
signals become uh drivers of uh of
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
investment decisions and and choices
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
about how to operate your storage or
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
your generation facilities and and i
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
think those uh price signals as a driver
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
of um
 
05:42:12.628 --> 05:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
dispatch and such is is is uh is very
 
05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
valuable compared to sort of subsidized
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:25.020 --> 05:42:25.030 align:start position:0%

purchasers may be any non-residential

retail load within the same area at line

the mix
 
05:42:49.200 --> 05:42:50.230 align:start position:0%
the mix
so

05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
there were some concerns about
 
05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
residential ratepayer you know
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
protections in terms of they
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
got involved with something like this
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
this would residential retail customers
 
05:43:01.830 --> 05:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
would not be able to participate in the
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
pilot so
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about impacts on residential
 
05:43:08.470 --> 05:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
customers are sort of set aside so this
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
would only be uh suppliers buying this
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
with at interest rate within state
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%

line 19 um
 
05:43:26.470 --> 05:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know this parallels some of the
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
previous discussions that this would
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%

05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
load-serving entities
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
either competitive electricity suppliers
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
that are registered with the commission
 
05:43:39.600 --> 05:43:40.390 align:start position:0%

enable participation in these kinds of

05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
makes a requirement that such any
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
facility uh participating in this would
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
have to have revenue grade interval
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
meterings that can accurately measure
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
their hourly imports and exports to the
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
distribution grid again of course that
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
would still be by puc and electric
 
05:44:28.868 --> 05:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
utility approval of what that metering
 
05:44:28.878 --> 05:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
utility approval of what that metering
is

05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:44:35.190 --> 05:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
then it does provide at line 29 like is
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
the case now with with net metering
 
05:44:39.430 --> 05:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
regular net metering exports to the
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
distribution grid by a limited producer
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
would be accounted for as a reduction or
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
an offset to the load obligation of the
 
05:44:48.470 --> 05:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
load serving entity for the limited
 
05:44:50.470 --> 05:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
producer for load settlement in the iso
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
new england wholesale electricity market
 
05:44:55.830 --> 05:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
meaning just to take an example if
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
lebanon community power was getting 800
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
kw from the lebanon landfill gas to
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
energy project and they had a total load
 
05:45:04.230 --> 05:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh that they were selling to customers
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
of uh three megawatts uh at in a given
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
hour then what they would have to buy
 
05:45:12.150 --> 05:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
from iso new england is uh whatever i
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
said three three megawatts less 800 kw
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
they still have 2.2 megawatts to to
 
05:45:19.990 --> 05:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
purchase uh to meet their load following
 
05:45:20.000 --> 05:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
purchase uh to meet their load following

05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
this would just be
 
05:45:24.150 --> 05:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know an offset to what that would
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise be which is physically what
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
happens on the grid
 
05:45:30.708 --> 05:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
and there's a parallel provision that if
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
a net meter customer is a customer of a
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%

their experts to the grid are used as an

and it it really at lines uh two three
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
and four it says the credit shall be
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
made pursuant to one of two paragraphs
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%

subparagraph b
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
is essentially
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
sort of what happens in pennsylvania
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is to say
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
the transmission charges instead of
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%

05:46:45.190 --> 05:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
even though it's charged to the
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities based on their
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
share of coincident peak demand each

05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
this would allow

05:47:07.120 --> 05:47:08.628 align:start position:0%
pilot um
and

05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
instead what would happen is those
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
transmission costs would be charged by
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
the load serving entity to their retail
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
customers based on that group's actual
 
05:47:19.120 --> 05:47:20.470 align:start position:0%
customers based on that group's actual
coincident

05:47:20.470 --> 05:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
coincident
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
share of peak demand so it
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
this this is uh something that i said no
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
england tariffs
 
05:47:26.840 --> 05:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
england tariffs
allow

05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
allow
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
it is actually done by eversource in
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
their western mass service area for
 
05:47:36.070 --> 05:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
large cni customers their largest cni
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
customers who have demand meters
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
actually pay for transmission costs
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
based on their share of the monthly
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
coincident peak they just get they just
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
get a pass-through of that charge that
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
comes through this would replicate the
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
same thing except it would be the net
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
load at that hour of coincident peak net
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
of any limited producer
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they produce because then point of
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact that is not would not be counted um
 
05:48:04.080 --> 05:48:05.670 align:start position:0%
fact that is not would not be counted um
towards

05:48:05.670 --> 05:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
towards
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
the transmission
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
coincident peak because it functions as
 
05:48:11.270 --> 05:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
a load reducer relative to the
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
transmission system
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
that that's sort of the
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh i think the sort of ideal way to do
 
05:48:18.868 --> 05:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
it it may be technically more difficult
 
05:48:20.548 --> 05:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
and so it may not be
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
it may not
 
05:48:27.670 --> 05:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
be easy to do in a pilot um so item c is
 
05:48:29.190 --> 05:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
the other way to do it which is to
 
05:48:30.868 --> 05:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
figure out a monetary credit that's
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what would be uh charged
 
05:48:34.080 --> 05:48:34.948 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what would be uh charged
um

05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:38.070 --> 05:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
or what the say what the actual savings
 
05:48:40.708 --> 05:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
are from avoided transmission charges uh
 
05:48:43.510 --> 05:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
based on the actual exports to the grid
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
at that hour of uh of coincident peak
 
05:48:45.920 --> 05:48:46.868 align:start position:0%
at that hour of uh of coincident peak
demand

05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
demand
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
um for each month
 
05:48:48.480 --> 05:48:50.830 align:start position:0%
um for each month
um

05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh just moving on because i know
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.840 --> 05:48:58.708 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
roman 10 just says you know the
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
purchases of a
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
power from limited producers you still
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
play the delivery tariff and all the
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
other charges that apply
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
um except for the energy service charge
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
obviously because you wouldn't be in
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
default service
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
or um transmission charges if they're
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
just to pursuant to the previous
 
05:49:18.878 --> 05:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
just to pursuant to the previous
paragraph

05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:21.920 --> 05:49:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
roman

05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
roman
 
05:49:23.840 --> 05:49:25.350 align:start position:0%
roman

05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
11
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
deals with a very parallel situation to
 
05:49:30.548 --> 05:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
transmission charges which is
 
05:49:33.190 --> 05:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
capacity the forward capacity market
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
charges they get allocated
 
05:49:36.320 --> 05:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
charges they get allocated
to

05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:49:37.200 --> 05:49:38.310 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:40.868 --> 05:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
each load serving entity
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
based on the capacity tag that all the
 
05:49:45.510 --> 05:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
meters that of the customers that
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
they're serving at a given point in time
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
have been assigned and capacity tags are
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
assigned to individual customers based
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
on either their own individual share of
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
the annual system peak if they have
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
hourly interval metering
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
um in our large customer
 
05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
so for instance the city has two large
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh g1 customers water treatment
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment their capacity tag
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
is actually based on their measured uh
 
05:50:15.680 --> 05:50:16.708 align:start position:0%
is actually based on their measured uh
annual

05:50:16.708 --> 05:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
annual
 
05:50:16.718 --> 05:50:18.310 align:start position:0%
annual
uh

05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
load or
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
um in one case we brought it down to
 
05:50:23.030 --> 05:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
zero because we had some solar behind
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
the meter and curtailed uh load um we
 
05:50:28.390 --> 05:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
were able to reduce the capacity tag
 
05:50:29.830 --> 05:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
down to zero
 
05:50:33.190 --> 05:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
this would allow for the fact that um
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
um exports to the grid say our landfill
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
gas energy project was exporting a
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt at the annual hour of system
 
05:50:45.910 --> 05:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
peak then that would actually have the
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
effect of reducing uh the capacity
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
tag total capacity attacks that are
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
charged to liberty by that full one
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
megawatt and it would actually reduce
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
the amount of capacity that that isone
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
england has to plan for because it's not
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
showing up as apparent load on the
 
05:51:06.310 --> 05:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
transmission grid so this would just
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism again it would have
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be pursue reviewed and approved by
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
the puc in an adjudicated proceeding
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
so the burden of proof is always on uh
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
the proposer of of in this case of a
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
pilot the burden of proof would be on
 
05:51:22.080 --> 05:51:22.948 align:start position:0%
pilot the burden of proof would be on
them

05:51:22.948 --> 05:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
to show demonstrate to the puc that this
 
05:51:27.590 --> 05:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
was actually um
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh a feasible thing to do and a fair uh
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do um that that's for the
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
public good or for the for the
 
05:51:39.590 --> 05:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
common good
 
05:51:41.830 --> 05:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's basically it it you know just
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
takes these concepts of saying uh
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
these values some of which are embedded
 
05:51:49.510 --> 05:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
in in what the compensation
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
is for um
 
05:51:51.920 --> 05:51:52.708 align:start position:0%
is for um
uh

05:51:52.708 --> 05:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:51:55.830 --> 05:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
in group net metering you get the full
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
default service rate which includes the
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
capacity cost this is just another way
 
05:52:02.310 --> 05:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
to recognize
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
the value of that capacity
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
reduction and in a way that actually
 
05:52:10.470 --> 05:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
aligns with the value actually produced
 
05:52:12.230 --> 05:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
whereas with group net metering or net
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
metering it's just sort of um it's it's
 
05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
an extremely rough justice it's like
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay we're supposing that these projects
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
help reduce capacity
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
which they may or may not and
 
05:52:26.718 --> 05:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
which they may or may not and
uh

05:52:28.470 --> 05:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
you know or they do to varying degrees
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes some projects produce
 
05:52:33.360 --> 05:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes some projects produce
more

05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
reduced capacity
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
more and others much less
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
this would actually align the actual
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
value produced with the um
 
05:52:45.600 --> 05:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
value produced with the um
uh

05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
charges you know passed on to those
 
05:52:48.320 --> 05:52:52.548 align:start position:0%
charges you know passed on to those
customers

05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the final section section 4 is just
 
05:52:57.110 --> 05:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
something that it's not per se part of
 
05:52:59.830 --> 05:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
the pilot but it's an important concept
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
which is with storage projects
 
05:53:06.070 --> 05:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you have battery storage uh right now
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
if if you
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
had a battery storage project that could
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
help shave peak demand and you were
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
getting charging it from the grid uh you
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
would in effect um
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
be getting a charge for
 
05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
rps compliance
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
and then when you turn around um and uh
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
export to the grid the customers that
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
buy that power will also be charged for
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
the rps compliance so you'd actually
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a double rps compliance
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
for battery storage that gets charged
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
from the grid this would simply stay if
 
05:53:41.590 --> 05:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
they can document if they have revenue
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
grade metering
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
that quantifies what they purchase from
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
the grid then that could be used to
 
05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
adjust the rps charges
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
as provided by the commission
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
so you're not sort of double counting
 
05:53:57.600 --> 05:53:59.590 align:start position:0%
so you're not sort of double counting
there

05:53:59.590 --> 05:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:53:59.600 --> 05:54:00.708 align:start position:0%
there
the the

05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:54:02.948 --> 05:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
i think the one opportunity that exists
 
05:54:06.788 --> 05:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
where i think this could have a um
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
where we see an opportunity on a small
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
scale pilot that might just involve a
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
handful of generators uh maybe maybe
 
05:54:15.350 --> 05:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
three or four or something like that is
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
we have a couple sites that are really
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
well suited for dual access solar
 
05:54:18.798 --> 05:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
well suited for dual access solar
trackers

05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
trackers
 
05:54:23.350 --> 05:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um solar trackers are are different
 
05:54:23.360 --> 05:54:24.230 align:start position:0%
and um solar trackers are are different
than

05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
fixed-oriented ones the fixtorian ones
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
tend to have a parabola curve on a sunny
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
day the power goes up and and at the
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
middle of whatever or the orientation
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
they are power peaks and it immediately
 
05:54:38.070 --> 05:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
starts dropping a dual axis tracker
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
follows the sun from sunrise to sunset
 
05:54:42.868 --> 05:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
aiming at the sun adjusting typically
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
every 15 minutes or so to follow the sun
 
05:54:47.110 --> 05:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
both angle
 
05:54:50.470 --> 05:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
tilt and orientation so as soon as the
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
sun clears the horizon their production
 
05:54:54.470 --> 05:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
goes up and it continues across the day
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
relatively flat and then right as the
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
sun drops below whatever the western
 
05:55:01.350 --> 05:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
horizon is that's where the power drops
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
off so you have a production profile
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
that much closer matches load
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
and and yet under current net metering
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
all kilowatt hours are valued the same
 
05:55:14.470 --> 05:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have a site that's you know ideal for
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
trackers because it's got basically 0.1
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
percent shading on far distant eastern
 
05:55:22.830 --> 05:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
and western horizons one of them off in
 
05:55:27.270 --> 05:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
vermont at our airport and i kind of ran
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
the numbers because we had a proposal
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
for dual access trackers and fixed
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
orientation south facing system
 
05:55:33.840 --> 05:55:34.628 align:start position:0%
orientation south facing system
and

05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
the the dual access trackers in terms of
 
05:55:39.510 --> 05:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
we looked at the lmp the locational
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
marginal price of electricity the
 
05:55:44.788 --> 05:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
coincidence with transmission and the
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
coincidence with the annual
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
capacity charges the value of those
 
05:55:51.910 --> 05:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours were on the order of 20
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
more across the board as a as an entire
 
05:55:54.878 --> 05:55:55.750 align:start position:0%
more across the board as a as an entire
group

05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
than it was for doing the same system
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
just fixed orientation to optimize kwh
 
05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
per year
 
05:56:02.958 --> 05:56:03.830 align:start position:0%
per year
the

05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
but but because there's no
 
05:56:09.990 --> 05:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
way to capture those values
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
it didn't it didn't really quite pencil
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
out because there's a little bit more
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
capital cost for the trackers than there
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
is for the fixed orientation system but
 
05:56:20.470 --> 05:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
if we could capture those values and
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of pilot would allow us to do
 
05:56:23.280 --> 05:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
this kind of pilot would allow us to do
that

05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
we could potentially uh
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
do something like that that the numbers
 
05:56:31.350 --> 05:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
would pencil out and actually
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
it may become apparent that that's
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
actually more advantageous
 
05:56:36.470 --> 05:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
which when you think about it over the
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
long term would actually be
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
more advantageous for the system because
 
05:56:42.310 --> 05:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you if you like me you know keep
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
checking your phone and seeing what's
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
happening with electricity prices and
 
05:56:52.628 --> 05:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
and demand what you keep seeing is this
 
05:56:52.638 --> 05:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
and demand what you keep seeing is this
um

05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:56.470 --> 05:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh cats here is i think what i what i
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
just saw it called instead of the duck
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh formation which is the way that um
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
load um
 
05:57:07.510 --> 05:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh follows uh it goes oops up and down
 
05:57:09.750 --> 05:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
over the course here it is um this is
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
our load duration curve um for today and
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're at the middle near the
 
05:57:16.948 --> 05:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
bottom of that trough probably because a
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the pv in new england is starting
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
to produce because the sun's out
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
and we had a peak in the morning it was
 
05:57:26.070 --> 05:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
cloudy rainy and we're gonna have a peak
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
um in the evening
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and uh all the solar is going to be
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
going down just as loads going up later
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon dual axis tracker is
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
going to it
 
05:57:39.030 --> 05:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
more closely match the production to the
 
05:57:41.190 --> 05:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
load and then if you add storage to that
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
you can really push um your your ability
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
to capture these uh uh to shave these
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
peak demands and when we shave those
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
peak demands uh and and you know sort of
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
fill the troughs for instance with
 
05:57:55.830 --> 05:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
battery storage taking power when
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
there's a surplus then we start to get a
 
05:58:00.788 --> 05:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
system that makes more is more
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
economically efficient and technically
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
efficient so that
 
05:58:07.110 --> 05:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is what this bill is about
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
is is kind of a baby step at this point
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of a potential pilot we might
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
get one or two of these
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think they'd be on a small scale um
 
05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
they would be a step towards something
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
that i think could prove out to be more
 
05:58:27.190 --> 05:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
economically and technically efficient
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and sort of reduces
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
some of the tensions around
 
05:58:33.990 --> 05:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy questions
 
05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:58:42.390 --> 05:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
the most obvious question uh
 
05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that this bill sets up
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
a pilot
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
is what would be a good duration period
 
05:58:49.990 --> 05:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a pilot
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
and what would be a good
 
05:58:52.558 --> 05:58:53.590 align:start position:0%
and what would be a good
uh

05:58:53.590 --> 05:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:59.040 --> 05:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
i i i think it would be fine to cap
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if you are you thinking
 
05:59:08.948 --> 05:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
caps in terms of megawatts or projects i
 
05:59:10.868 --> 05:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
would say a half a dozen or maybe five
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
projects in a pilot you know five excuse
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
me five generation or storage projects
 
05:59:18.230 --> 05:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
05:59:22.150 --> 05:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
up to maybe you know five projects what
 
05:59:26.548 --> 05:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.110 --> 05:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
i mean i think you'd want to allow
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
five or ten megawatts potentially to
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
participate because you might
 
05:59:33.440 --> 05:59:34.708 align:start position:0%
participate because you might
it

05:59:34.708 --> 05:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
it might be far less than that but but
 
05:59:39.510 --> 05:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
just thinking of lebanon as an example
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know we got one megawatt with our
 
05:59:43.830 --> 05:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
landfill gas to energy project and
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh it wouldn't be coming online until
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
next spring so i'm hopeful that we could
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
get it into a pilot
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
but but um
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
you know they'd like to leave some room
 
05:59:56.470 --> 05:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
for some um
 
05:59:58.628 --> 05:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
a few significant scale other projects
 
05:59:58.638 --> 05:59:59.590 align:start position:0%
a few significant scale other projects
so

05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe two or three megawatts you know
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
maximum that could participate in a in a
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
given pilot with a given distribution
 
06:00:06.400 --> 06:00:07.670 align:start position:0%
given pilot with a given distribution
utility

06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
utility
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh would allow you know at least one or
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
um duration
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know that that's a tough one because
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know if we didn't have group net
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
metering to fall back on
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and because we're right at one
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
megawatt we don't actually
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know we fall
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
in in the existing group metering not
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
the one that was expanded next last year
 
06:00:33.120 --> 06:00:34.150 align:start position:0%
the one that was expanded next last year
um

06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
so any you know anybody who's a liberty
 
06:00:38.470 --> 06:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
test customer could be a member of our
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
group um
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.948 --> 06:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some appeal to to
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
want to stick with that just because
 
06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's a known
 
06:00:50.480 --> 06:00:50.490 align:start position:0%
i think this pilot would actually um
 
06:00:50.490 --> 06:00:51.910 align:start position:0%
i think this pilot would actually um
[Music]

06:00:51.910 --> 06:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
could actually produce somewhat better
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
value but it's a little more speculative
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
but the problem is this project that
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
we've already made work um
 
06:01:04.070 --> 06:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh financially
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
but if you were looking at a new project
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
say a project with you know a few dozen
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
dual access trackers
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
the developer would say well okay i can
 
06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
make the numbers work under this scheme
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'll qualify
 
06:01:20.470 --> 06:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know if they were over 1 megawatt
 
06:01:22.470 --> 06:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
for group net metering
 
06:01:22.480 --> 06:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
for group net metering
um

06:01:22.880 --> 06:01:22.890 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:22.890 --> 06:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they would probably need at least 10
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
years worth of certainty in in their
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the rng bill that we heard yesterday
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
was also a pilot and it had a duration
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
of 15 years 15 years
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
would that be reasonable i i think that
 
06:01:44.470 --> 06:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
gets into the reasonable realm because i
 
06:01:45.210 --> 06:01:45.220 align:start position:0%
think um
 
06:01:45.220 --> 06:01:46.470 align:start position:0%
think um
[Music]

06:01:46.470 --> 06:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
a solar project might uh
 
06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
pay back within that period or be
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
financiable within that period
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
um or until 2040 is another possibility
 
06:01:57.200 --> 06:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
um or until 2040 is another possibility
um

06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:59.040 --> 06:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
um
i

06:01:59.830 --> 06:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
i think the uncertainty is we've talked
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
with a few developers who are
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
potentially interested in this but but
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're also
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
they want to understand better you know
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
how the terms would work and how
 
06:02:16.240 --> 06:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
how the terms would work and how
um

06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know if they could really count on
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
it uh in terms of getting financing um
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's why i'm thinking you know
 
06:02:26.470 --> 06:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
15 years or until 2040 that that's about
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
the same time frame
 
06:02:28.160 --> 06:02:29.110 align:start position:0%
the same time frame
uh

06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
would um should be enough to get
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
projects financed
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
okay with some uncertainty as to what
 
06:02:39.510 --> 06:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
happens at the end of that period
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman to follow on your
 
06:02:43.440 --> 06:02:44.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman to follow on your
point

06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
um i i do understand you wanting to have
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
some certainty
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the pilot so people can understand
 
06:02:52.230 --> 06:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
how to cost it out my question was
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
around to follow on duration and size
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions you said 5 to 10 megawatts i'm
 
06:03:00.628 --> 06:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have any
 
06:03:03.510 --> 06:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.520 --> 06:03:04.788 align:start position:0%
 
of

06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
a break point where
 
06:03:09.270 --> 06:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
in other words uh the scale to which the
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
project would have to be at a minimum in
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
order to even be doing the pilot
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
you you said five to ten it would five
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
be reasonable or does it need to be
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
larger in order to do the proof of
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
concept that you're talking about for a
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
i think you'll hear um from another
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
person testifying with one solar
 
06:03:33.990 --> 06:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
developer who who works specifically in
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
the one to five megawatt range
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
06:03:38.958 --> 06:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
and and um
they

06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:03:39.840 --> 06:03:42.150 align:start position:0%
they
um

06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
looked at this we discussed this with
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
them and they thought that this this
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
might make some of the projects they've
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
thought about in new hampshire pencil
 
06:03:51.190 --> 06:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
out in a way that
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
um well they don't you know the group
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
net metering and that scale is difficult
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
to do at this point uh because there's
 
06:03:59.670 --> 06:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
limited so-called off-takers
 
06:03:59.680 --> 06:04:03.190 align:start position:0%
limited so-called off-takers
um

06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
you know a project like that they might
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
say you know we we we need to do a three
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
or four megawatt project to make it to
 
06:04:10.470 --> 06:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
make it work
 
06:04:10.480 --> 06:04:12.070 align:start position:0%
make it work
um

06:04:12.070 --> 06:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i know in vermont there have been
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
several because the utility was involved
 
06:04:18.070 --> 06:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
in there have been several large uh dual
 
06:04:19.750 --> 06:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
access tracker projects where green
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
mountain power is the off taker
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
because they could see the value of that
 
06:04:26.708 --> 06:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the production um
 
06:04:26.718 --> 06:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the production um
uh

06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
if the cap was at five megawatts then
 
06:04:32.558 --> 06:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
if the cap was at five megawatts then
and

06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
there was one project that did most of
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that then that at least would be a pilot
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
for one project if it
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
in our case i we have some sites that
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
could handle more than one megawatt um
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
for solar
 
06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
not just in lebanon but in in other
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
areas communities that are thinking
 
06:04:53.430 --> 06:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
about municipal aggregations uh where
 
06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
there might be an interest in this
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh there are sites that can handle more
 
06:04:58.390 --> 06:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
than one megawatt
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's funny in in other regions
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the country where the price
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
incentives have changed uh at least
 
06:05:07.590 --> 06:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
single access trackers have become much
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
more common in other parts of the world
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
because they have a better production
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
curve that extends longer through the
 
06:05:13.760 --> 06:05:14.930 align:start position:0%
curve that extends longer through the
day

06:05:14.930 --> 06:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:05:14.940 --> 06:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
day
[Music]

06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:05:20.070 --> 06:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to continue to see
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
pressure for
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the single orientation fixed
 
06:05:25.280 --> 06:05:26.708 align:start position:0%
the the single orientation fixed
orientation

06:05:26.708 --> 06:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
solar because that's in new england
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
generally what's incentivized maximize
 
06:05:33.190 --> 06:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
kwh all kwhs are treated as equal in
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
value i think this
 
06:05:35.520 --> 06:05:36.788 align:start position:0%
value i think this
uh

06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
i guess we could revisit it i mean if
 
06:05:40.470 --> 06:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
there was a cap put on at five megawatts
 
06:05:44.548 --> 06:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
per pilot one pilot per per utility uh
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
and after year two we said this is going
 
06:05:48.868 --> 06:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
great then you could come back and
 
06:05:48.878 --> 06:05:50.230 align:start position:0%
great then you could come back and
exchange

06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh change the pilot
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
my my main concern is to create an
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to at least demonstrate that
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
this can work and um that
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that any utility who
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
participates in it may have to do some
 
06:06:06.390 --> 06:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the accounting on a manual basis um
 
06:06:08.470 --> 06:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and you know what that'll have to be
 
06:06:10.948 --> 06:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
paid for somehow um although if it's
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
just one or two or three or four
 
06:06:14.390 --> 06:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
06:06:15.990 --> 06:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
and they don't add up
 
06:06:18.390 --> 06:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
to large numbers uh then i think that
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
might be manageable i mean that they've
 
06:06:21.430 --> 06:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
done a certain amount of that for their
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
battery pilot for instance with liberty
 
06:06:27.430 --> 06:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
or when they started off doing group net
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
metering credits they were doing some of
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
that on a manual basis um
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i'm just rambling sorry
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay so cliff
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
we could talk with you all day long
 
06:06:39.670 --> 06:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
about this
 
06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
but it is 304 yes
 
06:06:44.788 --> 06:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
and uh so i am going to
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on senate bill
 
06:06:47.040 --> 06:06:49.190 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on senate bill
448-fn

06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
448-fn
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
and recess that public hearing so we can
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
we can continue this hearing we have
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
four more people that we need to hear
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
from and the first of those will be
 
06:06:59.830 --> 06:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
griffin roberge from the
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i forgot you raised your
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
hand right representative sumpt just did
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you very much mr
 
06:07:11.040 --> 06:07:11.910 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you very much mr
chairman

06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:07:14.548 --> 06:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
it's actually just a brief clarification
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
if you agree with my clarification i'm
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a stickler on the technicalities
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
of of units of measure
 
06:07:23.110 --> 06:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
so in this case we're talking about
 
06:07:24.708 --> 06:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
battery storage
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
so when somebody sees something like
 
06:07:28.470 --> 06:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
five megawatts
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
what that means is that you can
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
discharge five megawatts in one hour
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
right i should really say five megawatt
 
06:07:38.310 --> 06:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
hours because you can also discharge one
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
megawatt over five hours so it's a
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
storage device it's not a you know
 
06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
perpetual production right so just so
 
06:07:46.868 --> 06:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
people understand when you see for
 
06:07:48.628 --> 06:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
batteries when they don't leave out the
 
06:07:50.628 --> 06:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
hours it's always normalized for one
 
06:07:53.270 --> 06:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
hour so you can only get five megawatts
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
for one hour out of that battery and
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
right right i think it's theoretically
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
possible that a battery storage could
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
have even a higher momentary rating
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
which might be its interconnection
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
rating yeah you know that said it could
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
discharge six megawatts but it couldn't
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
do that for a whole hour that would be
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
their rated maximum output though so i
 
06:08:15.110 --> 06:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify some people see
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
that and they think that's kind of okay
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate you doing that
 
06:08:23.190 --> 06:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay mr robarge department of energy
 
06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman members of the
 
06:08:41.190 --> 06:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
from the department of energy joining me
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
up here today is david wiesner from the
 
06:08:48.310 --> 06:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
department he is our legal counsel in
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on senator
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
waters senate bill 321
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
just as background and i'm sure it goes
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
over some ground that we touched on with
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1635.
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 from last year created
 
06:09:05.360 --> 06:09:06.230 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 from last year created
the

06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission to study limited electric
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
energy producers or lipa commission as
 
06:09:12.708 --> 06:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you've heard it
 
06:09:14.470 --> 06:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
the commission filed a report on
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
november 1 of last year that noted
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
significant complexities uncertainties
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
and potential risks
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the proposal to expand
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
lipa retail sales
 
06:09:28.948 --> 06:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
sales transactions and provide avoided
 
06:09:30.628 --> 06:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
transmission charge credits to
 
06:09:33.270 --> 06:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
participants in those transactions
 
06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
the report did warn of unintended
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
consequences and the potential of cost
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
shifting from one class of electricity
 
06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
customer to another
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
the report did recommend a few next
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
steps all of which essentially involve
 
06:09:47.670 --> 06:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
further study of the many complex issues
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are involved
 
06:09:50.628 --> 06:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
whether by
 
06:09:51.990 --> 06:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire general court the
 
06:09:52.000 --> 06:09:53.190 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire general court the
legislature

06:09:53.190 --> 06:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:09:54.788 --> 06:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
the department or through a limited
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
future pilot program with quote a
 
06:10:00.070 --> 06:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
defined sunset date
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 does permit the puc to
 
06:10:03.440 --> 06:10:04.708 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 does permit the puc to
approve

06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
approve
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
pilot programs for certain limited
 
06:10:06.878 --> 06:10:08.548 align:start position:0%
pilot programs for certain limited
electricity

06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
energy producers to engage in
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
intra-state retail
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
and wholesale
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
electricity sales transactions this bill
 
06:10:19.030 --> 06:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
does have a more limited approach
 
06:10:21.430 --> 06:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
compared to house bill 1635 which you
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
folks heard earlier
 
06:10:25.110 --> 06:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
but the committee later decided to
 
06:10:26.788 --> 06:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the bill in front of you today
 
06:10:29.910 --> 06:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
the department did want to phrase a few
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
technical concerns
 
06:10:33.350 --> 06:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
while it appears it was probably touched
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
on earlier
 
06:10:36.628 --> 06:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
while the thrust of the bill is to
 
06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
create a pilot program for these types
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
of transactions there is no defined
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
limits on size
 
06:10:42.240 --> 06:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
limits on size
scale

06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
scale
 
06:10:46.708 --> 06:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
time periods or end dates for any pilot
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
nor are there any specific provisions
 
06:10:50.788 --> 06:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
for study or reporting regardless of the
 
06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
results of the approved pilot programs
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
again referencing senate bill 424 that
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
came up some of the kind of concepts
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
outlined in that bill
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
and additionally on page two of the bill
 
06:11:04.868 --> 06:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
lines one
 
06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
to six
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
um that would allow any limited producer
 
06:11:11.350 --> 06:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
participating in an approved pilot that
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
ends before december 31 of 2040
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for the applicable net
 
06:11:18.390 --> 06:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
metering tariff
 
06:11:20.070 --> 06:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
to which it would have otherwise been
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
eligible at the start of the pilot
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
this was essentially grandfather limited
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
producer into a tariff that did not
 
06:11:29.910 --> 06:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
originally seek advantage of and had not
 
06:11:32.070 --> 06:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
relied upon in developing a project it
 
06:11:33.270 --> 06:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
may be more
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that producer to be
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
eligible only for the net marine tariff
 
06:11:39.990 --> 06:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
that is in effect at the time the pilot
 
06:11:40.000 --> 06:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
that is in effect at the time the pilot
ends

06:11:41.590 --> 06:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
ends
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony certainly
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but
 
06:11:48.150 --> 06:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
any complex questions i'm going to punt
 
06:11:52.708 --> 06:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
06:11:58.708 --> 06:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
since mr weissner is here
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
i do have a question for you
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:12:06.310 --> 06:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
i asked no iso new england has an open
 
06:12:08.948 --> 06:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
access transmission tariff
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
and they also require utilities to sign
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
a transmission owner's
 
06:12:16.628 --> 06:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
operators agreement
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
in order for these leap transactions as
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
described in this this bill to take
 
06:12:22.320 --> 06:12:23.590 align:start position:0%
described in this this bill to take
place

06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
would that require
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
iso new england and ferc
 
06:12:27.520 --> 06:12:30.708 align:start position:0%
iso new england and ferc
to

06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
change those existing tariffs and
 
06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
operating agreements
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
reason why they would want to do that
 
06:12:43.990 --> 06:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question mr
 
06:12:46.390 --> 06:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
chairman i think the commission last
 
06:12:49.110 --> 06:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
fall heard some testimony about that
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i think the premise of this bill is
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
that it's possible to structure these
 
06:12:56.548 --> 06:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
transactions as holy interest date so
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
they would not be using the for
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional transmission system and
 
06:13:03.510 --> 06:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
therefore presumably no
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
modifications to the isoterror for
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
procedures would be necessary
 
06:13:10.150 --> 06:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
so would that restrict these
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
transactions just to local distribution
 
06:13:13.520 --> 06:13:14.628 align:start position:0%
transactions just to local distribution
uh

06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:14.638 --> 06:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
uh
networks

06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
networks
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
i mean again that's an interesting
 
06:13:19.830 --> 06:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
question i'm not sure was fully resolved
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
and might be an issue in any pilot
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
adjudication before the puc
 
06:13:27.350 --> 06:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
it may depend on the specifics of the
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
case where the generator is located
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
where the customer would be located what
 
06:13:34.390 --> 06:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
facilities are involved
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's possible that every source or other
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
utilities would have more to contribute
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
to that analysis and i expect they would
 
06:13:44.708 --> 06:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh in the context of a puc adjudication
 
06:13:47.350 --> 06:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you any other questions
 
06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has one
 
06:13:50.948 --> 06:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
the issue that both you and cliff
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
brought up about the um what happens if
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
you want to revert back i i see both
 
06:14:01.910 --> 06:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
sides of your argument i mean him saying
 
06:14:04.230 --> 06:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
that people aren't going to agree to go
 
06:14:05.430 --> 06:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
back to something if they don't know
 
06:14:07.190 --> 06:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
what it is and you saying how can you go
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
back to something that um
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist anymore
 
06:14:12.400 --> 06:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist anymore
any

06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
solutions out there that you see
 
06:14:15.120 --> 06:14:17.510 align:start position:0%
solutions out there that you see
possible

06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess our perspective is we
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
typically think of grandfathering as
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
protecting a reliance interest so you
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
built a project on an assumption that
 
06:14:26.628 --> 06:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
you'd have the benefit of a certain net
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
metering tariff design for example uh
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
and under the puc order and under the
 
06:14:32.470 --> 06:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
statute prior to that
 
06:14:34.948 --> 06:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
you would be grandfathered through 2040.
 
06:14:36.628 --> 06:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
if i understand what's intended in this
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill it's preserving more of the
 
06:14:42.150 --> 06:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost value you made a choice
 
06:14:44.310 --> 06:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
to go with a lepa pilot rather than that
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
metering and when that pilot ends
 
06:14:50.230 --> 06:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's 5 10 15 years down the road
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
the thought is you would be able to
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
revert to the benefits that you forwent
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
when you decided to to sign up for the
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
pilot and that's that's not the normal
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
concept of grandfathering i i might
 
06:15:05.430 --> 06:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
offer um
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
and and it would in certain
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances require the utility to
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
preserve sort of an open net metering
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
tariff design for somebody who might
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
change their mind later
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
after the puc had revised net metering
 
06:15:19.830 --> 06:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
06:15:22.390 --> 06:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll also say that
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
to some extent grandfathering is to
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
protect the interest of a new developer
 
06:15:29.350 --> 06:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
and as i read this bill it's not limited
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
to new development an existing hydro for
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
example under five megawatts uh could
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
seek to take advantage of this and and
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
then as i say you're not really
 
06:15:40.150 --> 06:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
protecting the same reliance interest
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
because the plant was built in 1982 you
 
06:15:42.878 --> 06:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
because the plant was built in 1982 you
know

06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up
 
06:15:48.150 --> 06:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh on the the question of that which is
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
phrase about the transmission because
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
what this came up and another bill on
 
06:15:53.750 --> 06:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
the other day if it was inter interest
 
06:15:53.760 --> 06:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
the other day if it was inter interest
intrastate

06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
intrastate
 
06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
meaning it could be let's say eversource
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
for example they said that they would
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
have areas where you could have a
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
generator in one location and a customer
 
06:16:07.270 --> 06:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
on that one that connected with them on
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
this limited uh producer thing uh would
 
06:16:09.920 --> 06:16:10.948 align:start position:0%
this limited uh producer thing uh would
be

06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
far enough away in the state that they
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
would actually use the transmission
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
system to get the power there so does
 
06:16:18.390 --> 06:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
that then create go back to chairman
 
06:16:20.548 --> 06:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
voice moses question about does that
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
mean we have to look at any implications
 
06:16:25.990 --> 06:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the iso tariff
 
06:16:27.830 --> 06:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't want to pretend to be an
 
06:16:27.840 --> 06:16:29.190 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't want to pretend to be an
expert

06:16:29.190 --> 06:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
expert
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
in this hearing but i think there are
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
probably are situations where a
 
06:16:35.190 --> 06:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
generator in one location and a customer
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
and another
 
06:16:37.670 --> 06:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's hard to see how the power would
 
06:16:39.590 --> 06:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
flow to that customer without the use of
 
06:16:39.600 --> 06:16:40.390 align:start position:0%
flow to that customer without the use of
the

06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
ferc jurisdictional
 
06:16:43.830 --> 06:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
pool transmission facilities that will
 
06:16:45.750 --> 06:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
be subject to the iso
 
06:16:48.070 --> 06:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are other situations where it's
 
06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
probably perfectly reasonable to assume
 
06:16:52.868 --> 06:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
that there would be no use of
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know physical or financial no use of
 
06:16:55.280 --> 06:16:55.990 align:start position:0%
you know physical or financial no use of
the

06:16:55.990 --> 06:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:16:59.430 --> 06:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
wholesale bulk transmission system
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:04.868 --> 06:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
additional questions for these gentlemen
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
06:17:08.868 --> 06:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
i just want to get back to what you just
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
said because i'm trying to understand
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
this um
 
06:17:16.150 --> 06:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
um the transmission is first
 
06:17:22.070 --> 06:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but distribution as a local
 
06:17:22.080 --> 06:17:22.868 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but distribution as a local
uh

06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:25.750 --> 06:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
distribution utility
 
06:17:25.760 --> 06:17:26.788 align:start position:0%
distribution utility
but

06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for the transmission
 
06:17:31.350 --> 06:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
system in our state
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
i i thought that went across the state
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
lines that's when ferc is involved and
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise when it's in our state
 
06:17:41.910 --> 06:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
by default or by contract uh the
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
distribution tool is also in charge
 
06:17:47.030 --> 06:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
somehow the transmission system is there
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
where is the legal boundary there i i'm
 
06:17:52.470 --> 06:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
not sure it's entirely clear
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think the premise of the bill is that
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
um if both the generator and the
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
customer are within the state yes then
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
any use of facilities within the state
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
to deliver the power would be an
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
intra-state transaction
 
06:18:09.910 --> 06:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore not subject to iso new
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
england or ferc
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's been tested i'm
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
not sure that's well established but
 
06:18:16.948 --> 06:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
that is the premise and and as i say
 
06:18:18.470 --> 06:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
those are some of the details that i
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
would assume would be worked out uh in a
 
06:18:22.150 --> 06:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
particular proposal that would come
 
06:18:23.590 --> 06:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
before the puc
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:27.040 --> 06:18:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative lowkey has a question
 
06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
um might it be possible to add a
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
provision that essentially says that
 
06:18:35.680 --> 06:18:36.390 align:start position:0%
provision that essentially says that
uh

06:18:36.390 --> 06:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the tran the uh sender generator and the
 
06:18:43.190 --> 06:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
user are within the same node off of the
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh major transmission thing then it
 
06:18:46.948 --> 06:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
would be legit because that truly would
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:55.270 --> 06:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
i mean that might be overly limiting
 
06:18:56.830 --> 06:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
06:18:59.350 --> 06:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
think i don't want to speak for mr bilo
 
06:19:01.190 --> 06:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
but he would probably say that it might
 
06:19:03.750 --> 06:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
be over overly limiting
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
um again i'm not sure those
 
06:19:08.070 --> 06:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional lines are as clearly
 
06:19:10.390 --> 06:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
established as any of us might like
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
in an approach like that
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
might seem like a safe harbor but it it
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you both for your
 
06:19:27.910 --> 06:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
testimony here this afternoon thank you
 
06:19:29.590 --> 06:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
and now i'd like to call up donna
 
06:19:32.628 --> 06:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
gamache from eversource to testify on
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon ms gamache
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
great to see you again nice to see you
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
all again thank you very much for the
 
06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
record donna gamache with eversource
 
06:19:46.000 --> 06:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
record donna gamache with eversource
energy

06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
um and right out of the gate i just want
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
to say that i wish i had um attorney
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
wiesner here to punt the difficult
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
questions too
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize that our ferc experts as
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
much as i tried to get it on their
 
06:20:01.270 --> 06:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
calendar i just could not align it so
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have me today so without that ferc
 
06:20:06.310 --> 06:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
expertise as a result i'd like to keep
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
my testimony as high level as possible
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
and if you do have any questions that i
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
cannot respond to i promise to get back
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
to you with answers so with that i just
 
06:20:17.110 --> 06:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you to senator waters
 
06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
and also to um mr bilo for trying to
 
06:20:22.468 --> 06:20:22.478 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that we have raised
 
06:20:23.830 --> 06:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
while this bill was going through the
 
06:20:23.840 --> 06:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
while this bill was going through the
senate

06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
senate
 
06:20:27.990 --> 06:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that they tried to
 
06:20:30.468 --> 06:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
to do that was to turn this into a pilot
 
06:20:30.478 --> 06:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
to do that was to turn this into a pilot
and

06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest concerns that we have
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
is the issue of jurisdiction and as you
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
just heard from attorney wiesner
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
apparently in so many areas it's a gray
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
area so um this is very very complicated
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
and during the senate bill 91 uh
 
06:20:47.750 --> 06:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission meetings i think it was
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
pretty clear it was complicated we had
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
the same issues we raised them during
 
06:20:53.670 --> 06:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 nothing has changed for
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
us since then um to now
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
but we do appreciate all the work that's
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
gone into this to try to address our
 
06:20:59.920 --> 06:21:01.750 align:start position:0%
gone into this to try to address our
concerns

06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
but i also want to say that as a company
 
06:21:06.788 --> 06:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the idea of creating an
 
06:21:08.708 --> 06:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
additional stream of revenue to try to
 
06:21:08.718 --> 06:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
additional stream of revenue to try to
facilitate

06:21:10.230 --> 06:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
new clean energy
 
06:21:13.990 --> 06:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
development in the state
 
06:21:15.990 --> 06:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
and we know that in so many of these
 
06:21:16.000 --> 06:21:17.670 align:start position:0%
and we know that in so many of these
transactions

06:21:17.670 --> 06:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
06:21:19.750 --> 06:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
they they cannot they cannot get
 
06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
financing unless they've got
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
certainty and over the years you as a
 
06:21:26.548 --> 06:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
committee you know representative kelly
 
06:21:28.150 --> 06:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
pitts seen them all
 
06:21:30.310 --> 06:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
you guys have worked
 
06:21:31.910 --> 06:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to try to make sure that
 
06:21:33.670 --> 06:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
there was a way to ensure that these
 
06:21:35.670 --> 06:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
projects would get off the ground
 
06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
you were very committed you
 
06:21:39.990 --> 06:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
created the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:21:43.110 --> 06:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
net metering group net metering virtual
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
net metering and then just late last
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
year enhanced community aggregation so
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
that you know inherently that these
 
06:21:50.958 --> 06:21:52.628 align:start position:0%
that you know inherently that these
projects

06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
projects
 
06:21:54.628 --> 06:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
tend to need help so there are you
 
06:21:56.390 --> 06:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
you've stepped up to the plate and now
 
06:21:58.468 --> 06:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
there's another potential opportunity
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we just want to make sure that
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
before you take the next leap on this
 
06:22:04.788 --> 06:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
one like you had you had many years to
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
work out all the others that we take a
 
06:22:09.190 --> 06:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
breather and make sure that it works for
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
somebody like us
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this for the following
 
06:22:13.600 --> 06:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this for the following
reasons

06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
we believe that the state does not have
 
06:22:19.030 --> 06:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction over these types of
 
06:22:20.948 --> 06:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
transactions you've heard about it
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
people have talked about it before me
 
06:22:25.030 --> 06:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
i've chatted with our ferc experts
 
06:22:28.468 --> 06:22:28.478 align:start position:0%
ad nauseum over this and they feel very
 
06:22:28.478 --> 06:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
ad nauseum over this and they feel very
confident

06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
confident
 
06:22:29.760 --> 06:22:30.868 align:start position:0%
confident
that

06:22:30.868 --> 06:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
that while the intent is that these are
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
intrastate transactions only using the
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
distribution system
 
06:22:42.628 --> 06:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
eversource unlike the other utilities in
 
06:22:43.590 --> 06:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
we represent well over 70 percent of the
 
06:22:49.270 --> 06:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
state in our service territory and it's
 
06:22:51.510 --> 06:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
while we we will probably be able to
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
come up with um instances where a
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
project can come forward that only uses
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
our distribution
 
06:23:01.350 --> 06:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh system we would have to make sure
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
that it was on the same distribution
 
06:23:03.040 --> 06:23:04.230 align:start position:0%
that it was on the same distribution
feeder

06:23:04.230 --> 06:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
feeder
 
06:23:04.240 --> 06:23:05.110 align:start position:0%
feeder
and

06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
but we'd have to be able to monitor that
 
06:23:08.868 --> 06:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
because we are moving power around on a
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis as you know you've watched
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
us evolve as a company we're far more
 
06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
reliable we have far more automation and
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose is to move power as
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
quickly as necessary so it is very very
 
06:23:22.468 --> 06:23:22.478 align:start position:0%
difficult to monitor especially given
 
06:23:25.910 --> 06:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
our geographic area so um and you
 
06:23:28.150 --> 06:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative votes about the
 
06:23:28.160 --> 06:23:29.430 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative votes about the
um

06:23:29.430 --> 06:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
the transmission owners operators
 
06:23:34.468 --> 06:23:34.478 align:start position:0%
agreement and we fear that this unless
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
we can prove that it is specifically
 
06:23:38.548 --> 06:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
using just our distribution
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
network that it would violate that
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have i with iso new
 
06:23:42.638 --> 06:23:43.670 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have i with iso new
england

06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
england
 
06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
so now we do appreciate that the um that
 
06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of the sponsors is that it
 
06:23:53.830 --> 06:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
not violate that so we would you know
 
06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
we'd be open to working with this
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee on language that would find in
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
some ways if we can come up with
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
language that we could all agree with
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that would narrow this scope down as
 
06:24:03.990 --> 06:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
much as possible
 
06:24:04.000 --> 06:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
much as possible
um

06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
i mean one i i did want to raise there's
 
06:24:11.110 --> 06:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
a good reason why iso new england
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
manages the transmission system and the
 
06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
transmission system whether it is in
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
state and out of state so how we see it
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
is if if there's a project say in nashua
 
06:24:24.788 --> 06:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
within our service territory in nashua
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
selling to a customer or vice versa a
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
customer up in coast county it's pretty
 
06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
hard to imagine a time when it wasn't
 
06:24:32.548 --> 06:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
going to be using our transmission
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
system and with that iso new england has
 
06:24:35.360 --> 06:24:36.628 align:start position:0%
system and with that iso new england has
jurisdiction

06:24:36.628 --> 06:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
06:24:38.468 --> 06:24:38.478 align:start position:0%
and as i said there's a good reason for
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
that it's to ensure reliability iso has
 
06:24:43.350 --> 06:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
to know what's happening on the system
 
06:24:45.990 --> 06:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can manage it but also for
 
06:24:48.310 --> 06:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
charging for rate recovery and it's to
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that all who use our transmission
 
06:24:53.350 --> 06:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
system are paying their fair share of it
 
06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
so if we do get past all that and we
 
06:24:57.190 --> 06:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
were to be able to come up with some
 
06:24:58.868 --> 06:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
language that worked that gave us some
 
06:25:00.868 --> 06:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
more comfort we
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
we think that there are some questions
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
that probably it's the public utilities
 
06:25:06.628 --> 06:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
commission or the department of energy
 
06:25:09.270 --> 06:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
would have to answer and that is if you
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
can prove that there are in fact savings
 
06:25:14.708 --> 06:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
those savings would have to be bundled
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
and would they they would have to find a
 
06:25:18.468 --> 06:25:18.478 align:start position:0%
way to calculate that to bundle it and
 
06:25:21.110 --> 06:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get it back not those savings would
 
06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
naturally go back to ratepayers if this
 
06:25:26.070 --> 06:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
if if this were to happen but to find a
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
way to not only calculate it bundle it
 
06:25:29.910 --> 06:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
but not to give it back to ratepayers
 
06:25:32.310 --> 06:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
but instead to give it to the generator
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
and another question is if there are
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
really no savings is the intent of the
 
06:25:40.070 --> 06:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
language to create saving to create a
 
06:25:42.070 --> 06:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
credit to the generator where there
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
isn't savings already and thereby
 
06:25:45.040 --> 06:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
isn't savings already and thereby
uh

06:25:45.830 --> 06:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:48.948 --> 06:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
there would need to be a calculation
 
06:25:50.548 --> 06:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
something would need to be created to
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
create to raise rates in order to give a
 
06:25:56.548 --> 06:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
credit to those generators so anyway if
 
06:25:58.230 --> 06:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
you do decide to move forward with this
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill those are kind of our questions
 
06:26:01.270 --> 06:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
we'd love to be at the table with you to
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
find the solutions we agree with the
 
06:26:05.430 --> 06:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
previous speakers that there should be a
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
cap there should be a reporting
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
requirement and there should be a
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
duration limit um
 
06:26:13.670 --> 06:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and i think that would you know
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
much of the other stuff has been raised
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
before me so i i think i will end there
 
06:26:20.708 --> 06:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions for ms
 
06:26:20.718 --> 06:26:21.910 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions for ms
gamache

06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
gamache
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
06:26:25.350 --> 06:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:26:27.510 --> 06:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
question uh miss gamache
 
06:26:30.390 --> 06:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
um in the example you gave from nashua
 
06:26:33.270 --> 06:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
to coast i think
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i had since
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
you started out with discussing the
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
transmission and transmission costs and
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
applicability of those costs to these
 
06:26:42.240 --> 06:26:43.590 align:start position:0%
applicability of those costs to these
projects

06:26:43.590 --> 06:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
projects
 
06:26:45.910 --> 06:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that in our
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding states in new england that
 
06:26:49.670 --> 06:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
are doing more investing than we are in
 
06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
06:26:51.120 --> 06:26:52.230 align:start position:0%
these types of
projects

06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
projects
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the the point really is to have
 
06:26:57.430 --> 06:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
local generations serve local needs so
 
06:26:57.440 --> 06:26:58.310 align:start position:0%
local generations serve local needs so
that

06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:58.320 --> 06:27:00.310 align:start position:0%
that
transmission

06:27:00.310 --> 06:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
06:27:02.390 --> 06:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
transmission costs are avoided
 
06:27:03.990 --> 06:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've had reports in this
 
06:27:05.670 --> 06:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee that new hampshire is going to
 
06:27:07.670 --> 06:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
be picking up a higher share of
 
06:27:09.270 --> 06:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
transmission costs in the future because
 
06:27:11.350 --> 06:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's less investment here
 
06:27:14.948 --> 06:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
in these types of generation projects so
 
06:27:17.430 --> 06:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is i i don't know
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
how you come to the i understand the
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
concern of saying
 
06:27:23.830 --> 06:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
we may not
 
06:27:25.590 --> 06:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
know when transmission lines are
 
06:27:25.600 --> 06:27:26.948 align:start position:0%
know when transmission lines are
involved

06:27:26.948 --> 06:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:27:28.708 --> 06:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
but isn't there a way for us to
 
06:27:30.788 --> 06:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
determine that if if a pilot like this
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
comes online and it's you know it's
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
06:27:36.070 --> 06:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
finite proposal that they're going to
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
work with whatever utility is involved
 
06:27:41.110 --> 06:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um to come up with so wouldn't wouldn't
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
that be something that would be answered
 
06:27:43.910 --> 06:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:27:43.920 --> 06:27:45.910 align:start position:0%
in the
speccing

06:27:45.910 --> 06:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
speccing
 
06:27:47.590 --> 06:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
game i'll end with the word specking and
 
06:27:49.590 --> 06:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
you can go on from
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
well i think you raise uh very good
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your questions
 
06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
first i just want to start by saying
 
06:27:57.110 --> 06:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
again we would i think the way you would
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
truly be able to do this is to make sure
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
that it is in its honest system on a
 
06:28:03.110 --> 06:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
distribution feeder that we can prove is
 
06:28:04.948 --> 06:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
really just on the distribution system
 
06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
it is going to be hard to do but we
 
06:28:08.868 --> 06:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
would be committed to to working with
 
06:28:10.468 --> 06:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
the committee to find a way to see if we
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
06:28:13.030 --> 06:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would say with regard to the
 
06:28:15.670 --> 06:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
transmission costs um i i think that
 
06:28:17.750 --> 06:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
over the years we've heard this bantered
 
06:28:19.830 --> 06:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
about a bit and i think if you look at
 
06:28:21.750 --> 06:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
how it is actually playing out in the
 
06:28:21.760 --> 06:28:22.708 align:start position:0%
how it is actually playing out in the
region

06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
region
 
06:28:24.150 --> 06:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's playing out that way
 
06:28:25.910 --> 06:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
exactly and the reason is if you can
 
06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
look you can see the the transmission
 
06:28:29.590 --> 06:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
charges for each state they go up and
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
down and i'm not sure that you know if
 
06:28:32.788 --> 06:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
you look over the last four or five
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
years that they probably haven't wound
 
06:28:35.590 --> 06:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
their way back where they were
 
06:28:38.310 --> 06:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
originally in many cases but because the
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
costs for transmission are the costs for
 
06:28:43.750 --> 06:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
transmission and if every state in the
 
06:28:46.070 --> 06:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
new england region reduce their tried to
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
reduce their transmission costs who
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
would be left to pay the transmission
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
bills there's just going to be another
 
06:28:52.868 --> 06:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
way of allocating those costs so i just
 
06:28:54.628 --> 06:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that so i think it's a
 
06:28:57.190 --> 06:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
noble exercise and at some point i mean
 
06:28:58.868 --> 06:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
we should all try to do it but at some
 
06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
point the transmission costs are what
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
they are and we're going to have to
 
06:29:05.430 --> 06:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
cover those costs may i have a follow-up
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'd prefer you didn't
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of more people who need
 
06:29:10.868 --> 06:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
06:29:13.590 --> 06:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it's already almost 3 30.
 
06:29:15.510 --> 06:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh do you need a question representative
 
06:29:15.520 --> 06:29:17.670 align:start position:0%
uh do you need a question representative
samsic

06:29:17.670 --> 06:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
samsic
 
06:29:19.990 --> 06:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
06:29:20.000 --> 06:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
okay

06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative samsic
 
06:29:23.760 --> 06:29:24.868 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative samsic
um

06:29:24.868 --> 06:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:26.468 --> 06:29:26.478 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
we have heard so often and i think it's
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
well well deserved that eversource is
 
06:29:39.030 --> 06:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
one of the outstanding utilities in the
 
06:29:40.468 --> 06:29:40.478 align:start position:0%
country when it comes to energy
 
06:29:43.110 --> 06:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency issues
 
06:29:45.910 --> 06:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
battery storage and using energy
 
06:29:47.990 --> 06:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
when it's most needed
 
06:29:50.310 --> 06:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
is one of those techniques to
 
06:29:52.310 --> 06:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
even out the demand
 
06:29:54.788 --> 06:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
and provide a valuable energy when it's
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
most needed
 
06:29:58.310 --> 06:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that even energy
 
06:30:00.468 --> 06:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
efficiency is nothing different than a
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
load reducer
 
06:30:04.070 --> 06:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're moving around demand so some
 
06:30:05.750 --> 06:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
place you reduce your demand and moves
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
around and you guys manage the grid
 
06:30:11.190 --> 06:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
based on what the demand is so is this
 
06:30:12.390 --> 06:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes so so i think uh to i would be
 
06:30:18.150 --> 06:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
surprised if you don't have examples in
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
other states already where you've been
 
06:30:22.868 --> 06:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
working of how to manage battery storage
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
in a way that doesn't violate the
 
06:30:27.190 --> 06:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
transmission issues
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from what i know about
 
06:30:29.840 --> 06:30:31.030 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from what i know about
our

06:30:31.030 --> 06:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:30:34.390 --> 06:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
battery storage opportunities is where
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have we have one i
 
06:30:38.708 --> 06:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
if it's not online yet it's pretty close
 
06:30:40.230 --> 06:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
to being online
 
06:30:42.150 --> 06:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
and it's in the cape
 
06:30:44.468 --> 06:30:44.478 align:start position:0%
and it's intended to it's in a very
 
06:30:47.030 --> 06:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive ecological area and they have
 
06:30:50.868 --> 06:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
a need for another um distribution line
 
06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and so instead of constructing in a very
 
06:30:56.628 --> 06:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
ecologically sensitive area we have a
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
battery uh storage uh project out there
 
06:31:01.750 --> 06:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the hope is that we will show that
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know it does so much more than we
 
06:31:04.868 --> 06:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
had hoped
 
06:31:06.468 --> 06:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
and i think in some other areas of
 
06:31:07.910 --> 06:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts we're moving forward with
 
06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
i think representative oxenam knows very
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
well that we tried to have a battery
 
06:31:15.590 --> 06:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
storage project here in new hampshire as
 
06:31:18.150 --> 06:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
well so we're not opposed to testing
 
06:31:19.830 --> 06:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
those out as long as they work and we
 
06:31:21.270 --> 06:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
can work with our regulators to make
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
them um feasible for our customers we're
 
06:31:24.868 --> 06:31:24.878 align:start position:0%
always open to that
 
06:31:26.390 --> 06:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
so you're saying it's an alternative to
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
transmission lines is the battery in the
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
case of cable well it's that's a
 
06:31:31.910 --> 06:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
distribution line
 
06:31:34.868 --> 06:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
um but i we believe that you know as
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
this technology um advances we'll be
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
using more batteries
 
06:31:41.670 --> 06:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
instead of maybe an upgrade to a
 
06:31:43.350 --> 06:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
substation or an additional line here
 
06:31:45.670 --> 06:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
and there okay thank you you're welcome
 
06:31:47.910 --> 06:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ms gamache appreciate
 
06:31:52.150 --> 06:31:52.160 align:start position:0%

06:33:14.948 --> 06:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes it was a contrasting opinion i think
 
06:33:17.670 --> 06:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh for those that don't know who i am
 
06:33:20.708 --> 06:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
my name is pentialto
 
06:33:22.948 --> 06:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
i'm a consultant
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
i've been in the
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i live in pembroke new hampshire
 
06:33:29.190 --> 06:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at the issue of
 
06:33:29.200 --> 06:33:30.390 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at the issue of
integrating

06:33:30.390 --> 06:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
integrating
 
06:33:32.948 --> 06:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh distributed generation
 
06:33:34.708 --> 06:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
and active load
 
06:33:37.110 --> 06:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
into the grid
 
06:33:37.120 --> 06:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
into the grid
since

06:33:38.070 --> 06:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:33:40.310 --> 06:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
the early 70s
 
06:33:42.070 --> 06:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
when i realized
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
as an engineering person that i could
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
have a nice technical solution to a
 
06:33:48.390 --> 06:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
problem that was irrelevant because of
 
06:33:48.400 --> 06:33:50.948 align:start position:0%
problem that was irrelevant because of
policies

06:33:50.948 --> 06:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
policies
 
06:33:53.670 --> 06:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
based on that i began to focus on
 
06:33:56.390 --> 06:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
change in the electric industry
 
06:33:56.400 --> 06:33:57.350 align:start position:0%
change in the electric industry
and

06:33:57.350 --> 06:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:34:00.708 --> 06:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:02.548 --> 06:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
initiate a project that became the
 
06:34:04.948 --> 06:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
governor's commission on cogeneration in
 
06:34:08.628 --> 06:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in the mid 70s
 
06:34:08.638 --> 06:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in the mid 70s
that

06:34:09.510 --> 06:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
had an influence on the design of the
 
06:34:13.830 --> 06:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
purple rules which
 
06:34:13.840 --> 06:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
purple rules which
permitted

06:34:15.190 --> 06:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
06:34:17.910 --> 06:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities to sell power to
 
06:34:17.920 --> 06:34:21.270 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities to sell power to
utilities

06:34:21.270 --> 06:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.280 --> 06:34:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:34:24.390 --> 06:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:27.430 --> 06:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
and from there uh what became apparent
 
06:34:27.440 --> 06:34:28.628 align:start position:0%
and from there uh what became apparent
that

06:34:28.628 --> 06:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:34:30.548 --> 06:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
a restructuring of the industry was
 
06:34:33.270 --> 06:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
necessary so i was part of
 
06:34:33.280 --> 06:34:34.628 align:start position:0%
necessary so i was part of
many

06:34:34.628 --> 06:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
many
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh hearings on restructuring the
 
06:34:39.750 --> 06:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:42.628 --> 06:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
particularly since we view it as we've
 
06:34:44.548 --> 06:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
viewed it as a natural monopoly when it
 
06:34:44.558 --> 06:34:48.070 align:start position:0%
viewed it as a natural monopoly when it
wasn't

06:34:48.070 --> 06:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.708 --> 06:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
the paper that i submitted talks
 
06:34:52.628 --> 06:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
primarily this was written many years
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
ago as you can see i'm dyslexic so
 
06:34:56.468 --> 06:34:56.478 align:start position:0%
nobody can read what i write and this
 
06:34:58.868 --> 06:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
took about a month to write
 
06:35:00.628 --> 06:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
um it was written
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
looking at net metering
 
06:35:06.548 --> 06:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
and i think these are very relative
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:11.670 --> 06:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
06:35:14.070 --> 06:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
we can simplify this by basically having
 
06:35:16.868 --> 06:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
a transparent reversible price
 
06:35:19.510 --> 06:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the customer whether they buy or sell
 
06:35:21.590 --> 06:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
it is the same price
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
the issue with that of course is that
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's inefficient
 
06:35:29.030 --> 06:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:31.270 --> 06:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't represent cost the pricing
 
06:35:33.830 --> 06:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
structure we have doesn't represent cost
 
06:35:36.628 --> 06:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't represent value
 
06:35:42.070 --> 06:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:44.468 --> 06:35:44.478 align:start position:0%
that leads to
 
06:35:46.390 --> 06:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
across subsidies
 
06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
not just for the solar that may be
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
generating and i there was another term
 
06:35:52.390 --> 06:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
to the duck curve called cat sears which
 
06:35:53.830 --> 06:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
came from the
 
06:35:53.840 --> 06:35:54.628 align:start position:0%
came from the
um

06:35:54.628 --> 06:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:57.430 --> 06:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
the executive running uh gordon van gli
 
06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
running the iso
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at today's load curves
 
06:36:02.708 --> 06:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a morning spike and
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
an evening spike of about the same size
 
06:36:06.798 --> 06:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
an evening spike of about the same size
and

06:36:08.230 --> 06:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's been there for well beyond the
 
06:36:11.910 --> 06:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
times that solar has been around it's
 
06:36:15.030 --> 06:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
always there
 
06:36:17.590 --> 06:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the issue that comes from all of
 
06:36:19.190 --> 06:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
06:36:21.430 --> 06:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately we need to be able to see as
 
06:36:23.830 --> 06:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
customers what's going on in the system
 
06:36:26.548 --> 06:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
and then either contribute to that
 
06:36:28.468 --> 06:36:28.478 align:start position:0%
controlling costs or not
 
06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is if we do not control the
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
cost particularly of transmission and
 
06:36:33.040 --> 06:36:34.948 align:start position:0%
cost particularly of transmission and
distribution

06:36:34.948 --> 06:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
06:36:37.030 --> 06:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
with the advent of batteries more and
 
06:36:39.190 --> 06:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
more people will find that they can
 
06:36:39.200 --> 06:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
more people will find that they can
disconnect

06:36:41.990 --> 06:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
06:36:43.990 --> 06:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be a lost all of us it
 
06:36:45.990 --> 06:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be much better if their equipment
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
and services that they provide can be
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
integrated into the system
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
um i believe this piece of legislation
 
06:37:00.948 --> 06:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
moves us a step in that direction it
 
06:37:03.270 --> 06:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
looks at the issue of transmission
 
06:37:05.350 --> 06:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
as a potential
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh cost-saving area
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
i further look at going further than
 
06:37:14.468 --> 06:37:14.478 align:start position:0%
that into the distribution system itself
 
06:37:16.230 --> 06:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
to allow for variable pricing for
 
06:37:17.910 --> 06:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
distribution service
 
06:37:20.708 --> 06:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
both in location and in time
 
06:37:23.030 --> 06:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're at the far end of a system
 
06:37:24.548 --> 06:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
you would pay a little bit more for the
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
power you buy
 
06:37:28.390 --> 06:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and get a higher credit for if you sold
 
06:37:30.548 --> 06:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
some at that point than if you were at
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
the substation end of it
 
06:37:36.548 --> 06:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of wire that cost
 
06:37:36.558 --> 06:37:37.430 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of wire that cost
is

06:37:37.430 --> 06:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:37:39.750 --> 06:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to get the power to you
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
likewise if the wire is melting on an
 
06:37:44.070 --> 06:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
august afternoon the price should be a
 
06:37:45.430 --> 06:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
lot higher
 
06:37:47.350 --> 06:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
if there's no load on the wire the price
 
06:37:49.670 --> 06:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
should be zero with a hockey stick type
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
of price curve connecting them which is
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
what happens in
 
06:37:53.040 --> 06:37:54.070 align:start position:0%
what happens in
markets

06:37:54.070 --> 06:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
markets
 
06:37:57.830 --> 06:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
when you get a shortage of capacity
 
06:38:01.270 --> 06:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
we are not there
 
06:38:03.760 --> 06:38:04.708 align:start position:0%
we are not there
and

06:38:04.708 --> 06:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:07.510 --> 06:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
experiments like this one pilots looking
 
06:38:09.030 --> 06:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
at ways of
 
06:38:11.910 --> 06:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
are beginning toward that
 
06:38:14.390 --> 06:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
if we do not succeed
 
06:38:18.070 --> 06:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
we will destroy the utility industry
 
06:38:20.230 --> 06:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
it will go the way of railroads it will
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
go the way of wired telephone service
 
06:38:24.320 --> 06:38:25.590 align:start position:0%
go the way of wired telephone service
um

06:38:25.590 --> 06:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:27.910 --> 06:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
at any number of other activities that
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
we have if we can properly integrate
 
06:38:33.910 --> 06:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
distributed generation into the grid in
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
a way that
 
06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
still provides revenue recovery within
 
06:38:41.910 --> 06:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:41.920 --> 06:38:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
then

06:38:42.788 --> 06:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:38:45.750 --> 06:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
we would all benefit from that
 
06:38:47.910 --> 06:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
now the issue is that if a bunch of
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
generators begin to appear in
 
06:38:51.990 --> 06:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
distribution that does reduce the
 
06:38:54.150 --> 06:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
payments the revenue
 
06:38:55.830 --> 06:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
for distribution and transmission
 
06:38:55.840 --> 06:38:59.430 align:start position:0%
for distribution and transmission
service

06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:01.510 --> 06:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
is that absolutely guaranteed that that
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
will be recovered no
 
06:39:06.628 --> 06:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
the history of regulation has it that a
 
06:39:09.270 --> 06:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
utility or any regulated entity is not
 
06:39:12.070 --> 06:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
protected against competition
 
06:39:14.788 --> 06:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
or changes in the market
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
um or changes in the economy generally
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
they have a reasonable opportunity to
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
recover their investment
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
with a reasonable return on that
 
06:39:24.958 --> 06:39:26.548 align:start position:0%
with a reasonable return on that
investment

06:39:26.548 --> 06:39:26.558 align:start position:0%
investment
 
06:39:28.390 --> 06:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
but if they can't maintain a price that
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
is in the public interest
 
06:39:32.548 --> 06:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
they don't recover it
 
06:39:34.868 --> 06:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
they go broke somebody else buys the
 
06:39:36.868 --> 06:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
assets for a reduced price and continues
 
06:39:38.070 --> 06:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
running it
 
06:39:40.628 --> 06:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
cases like that can be found with market
 
06:39:42.708 --> 06:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
street railway in the 40s
 
06:39:45.430 --> 06:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
street railway was over invested
 
06:39:47.510 --> 06:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it went away and was bought by
 
06:39:51.510 --> 06:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go that route we have a
 
06:39:56.390 --> 06:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money invested in
 
06:39:58.948 --> 06:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
our systems can we come up with a way
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
that allows us to transition to a system
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
that provides efficiency in pricing for
 
06:40:05.120 --> 06:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
that provides efficiency in pricing for
all

06:40:08.070 --> 06:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.868 --> 06:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
mr bilo mentioned there that for this
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
one residentials probably would not be
 
06:40:13.360 --> 06:40:15.110 align:start position:0%
one residentials probably would not be
included

06:40:15.110 --> 06:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
included
 
06:40:17.430 --> 06:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
i can point out that for 15 years
 
06:40:19.670 --> 06:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
commonwealth edison has had a rate
 
06:40:22.230 --> 06:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
available to residential customers
 
06:40:24.230 --> 06:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
that it was hourly variable in one form
 
06:40:25.510 --> 06:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
or another
 
06:40:28.468 --> 06:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
the most recent rate is a real-time rate
 
06:40:31.270 --> 06:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
it changes every hour
 
06:40:33.670 --> 06:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
and they have to support that a
 
06:40:36.070 --> 06:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
five-minute rate which is available
 
06:40:37.670 --> 06:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
for control of the equipment that
 
06:40:39.830 --> 06:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
customers have
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
those that choose to can support by
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
reducing load
 
06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
turning on generation
 
06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
and other things like that
 
06:40:49.270 --> 06:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
their exposure
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
is as
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
mr bilo mentioned similar in that they
 
06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
have a capacity obligation for
 
06:40:55.040 --> 06:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
have a capacity obligation for
generation

06:40:56.390 --> 06:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
generation
 
06:40:58.230 --> 06:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me i hate to interrupt you but
 
06:41:00.868 --> 06:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
yes uh could you
 
06:41:03.030 --> 06:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
relate what you're discussing to this
 
06:41:05.830 --> 06:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill this particular bill is
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
a step in the way to get there
 
06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's a good one because it
 
06:41:13.350 --> 06:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
provides one more alternative
 
06:41:15.110 --> 06:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
as a way of getting from where we have
 
06:41:17.350 --> 06:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
been for 100 years and to where we need
 
06:41:20.230 --> 06:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be if this is going to survive
 
06:41:22.788 --> 06:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
okay excellent good any questions for
 
06:41:22.798 --> 06:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
okay excellent good any questions for
him

06:41:23.750 --> 06:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
him
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:28.708 --> 06:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:41:30.628 --> 06:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you i thank you for your testimony
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
and i call kelly buchanan to be the
 
06:41:51.990 --> 06:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:54.390 --> 06:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon folks or nearly
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
good evening um
 
06:41:58.150 --> 06:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
i will be brief today but i thank you
 
06:42:00.390 --> 06:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
for your time my name is kelly buchanan
 
06:42:00.400 --> 06:42:01.190 align:start position:0%
for your time my name is kelly buchanan
i

06:42:01.190 --> 06:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
am the director of legislative and
 
06:42:04.628 --> 06:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory affairs for clean energy new
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we are glad to support
 
06:42:09.510 --> 06:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 which explores an
 
06:42:11.590 --> 06:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
innovative policy through a limited
 
06:42:13.990 --> 06:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program basis and that would be
 
06:42:16.310 --> 06:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately vetted at the puc
 
06:42:19.430 --> 06:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i want to draw folks back to um some
 
06:42:21.430 --> 06:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
earlier remarks from eversource and
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
donna gamache that there are some
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
concerns and some disagreements
 
06:42:27.910 --> 06:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
regarding whether ferc comes into this
 
06:42:27.920 --> 06:42:29.110 align:start position:0%
regarding whether ferc comes into this
discussion

06:42:29.110 --> 06:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:42:31.350 --> 06:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that these questions
 
06:42:33.030 --> 06:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
really are most appropriately answered
 
06:42:35.190 --> 06:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission and
 
06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
that would be the venue in which we
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
would expect and
 
06:42:41.910 --> 06:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
be assured that any concerns regarding
 
06:42:43.990 --> 06:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
ferc jurisdiction on each of these pilot
 
06:42:46.948 --> 06:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
programs would be resolved and if there
 
06:42:48.628 --> 06:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
was an issue that those pilots would not
 
06:42:50.310 --> 06:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
move forward and would not be approved
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
and so i think senate bill 321 really
 
06:42:54.628 --> 06:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
places the appropriate guard rails in
 
06:42:54.638 --> 06:42:55.590 align:start position:0%
places the appropriate guard rails in
place

06:42:55.590 --> 06:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:42:58.948 --> 06:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
and would help us expand the marketplace
 
06:43:02.230 --> 06:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
for distributed energy resources locally
 
06:43:03.830 --> 06:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
produced energy
 
06:43:05.510 --> 06:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
in that one to five megawatt category
 
06:43:09.990 --> 06:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
i will end with that i will also mention
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
that borrego is very interested in
 
06:43:15.110 --> 06:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
expanding their business into new
 
06:43:16.708 --> 06:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire they're already quite active
 
06:43:18.150 --> 06:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and maine they
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being able to be here
 
06:43:20.320 --> 06:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being able to be here
today

06:43:21.510 --> 06:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
but they are very excited about the
 
06:43:25.350 --> 06:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
value of avoided transmission and
 
06:43:29.190 --> 06:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
capacity costs to be recognized in new
 
06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire so with that thank you very
 
06:43:32.468 --> 06:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
much and i'd be glad to take with any of
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
06:43:35.750 --> 06:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you miss buchanan we appreciate
 
06:43:39.270 --> 06:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
that any questions from ms buchanan
 
06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
06:43:41.440 --> 06:43:42.390 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
chairman

06:43:42.390 --> 06:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:43:44.070 --> 06:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes that was the question i had in
 
06:43:46.390 --> 06:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up as well as whether the as a
 
06:43:48.468 --> 06:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
pilot that these uh issues could be
 
06:43:49.830 --> 06:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
addressed through the public utilities
 
06:43:52.310 --> 06:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
commission and i wonder since you have
 
06:43:52.320 --> 06:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
commission and i wonder since you have
participated

06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
participated
 
06:43:56.070 --> 06:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
in public utilities commission
 
06:43:56.080 --> 06:43:57.590 align:start position:0%
in public utilities commission
dockets

06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
dockets
 
06:43:59.510 --> 06:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh whether you think even beyond the
 
06:44:01.110 --> 06:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
transmission question there were several
 
06:44:02.788 --> 06:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised at the time
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
that eversource was up testifying
 
06:44:07.590 --> 06:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
that whether those would be the types of
 
06:44:10.548 --> 06:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
things that would be addressed in a puc
 
06:44:10.558 --> 06:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
things that would be addressed in a puc
proceeding

06:44:12.230 --> 06:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
06:44:14.468 --> 06:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
for a pilot sure i think
 
06:44:16.788 --> 06:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
um there was some earlier mention from
 
06:44:19.910 --> 06:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
the department of energy that a duration
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
a cap and a study and reporting
 
06:44:23.910 --> 06:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
requirement would be useful in this bill
 
06:44:25.430 --> 06:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
language and i think that is something
 
06:44:27.270 --> 06:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
that we certainly agree with
 
06:44:28.628 --> 06:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
and that would be fine to implement
 
06:44:31.030 --> 06:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
anything else though beyond the
 
06:44:33.910 --> 06:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
parameters of the pilot program i think
 
06:44:35.510 --> 06:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
really could be decided at the public
 
06:44:37.190 --> 06:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
utilities commission with the
 
06:44:37.200 --> 06:44:38.548 align:start position:0%
utilities commission with the
appropriate

06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved i know uh miss
 
06:44:41.990 --> 06:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
kamash mentioned
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the ferc expertise i'm sure that they
 
06:44:45.510 --> 06:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be accurately represented at the
 
06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:49.280 --> 06:44:50.868 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for ms
 
06:44:54.468 --> 06:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
buchanan i would like to thank you for
 
06:44:56.468 --> 06:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and i would
 
06:44:58.468 --> 06:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
like to ask representative white for the
 
06:45:13.670 --> 06:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:17.430 --> 06:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right so we have one in support uh
 
06:45:19.350 --> 06:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
on the sheet and then we have 74 online
 
06:45:21.990 --> 06:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
in support and no opposing
 
06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you with that we'll close the
 
06:45:25.830 --> 06:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
06:45:28.708 --> 06:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 321 and resume the already
 
06:45:32.468 --> 06:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
open public hearing on senate bill 448
 
06:45:34.708 --> 06:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
and i'll ask the prime sponsor senator
 
06:45:37.430 --> 06:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
david waters to introduce this bill to
 
06:45:38.548 --> 06:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:45:40.628 --> 06:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
and i will alert everyone to the fact
 
06:45:43.270 --> 06:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there is only one pink card before
 
06:45:45.510 --> 06:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
me with regard to this bill
 
06:45:47.510 --> 06:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if anybody else wants to testify you
 
06:45:50.868 --> 06:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
need to submit a pink card
 
06:45:52.868 --> 06:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
and senator waters is yours i don't know
 
06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
what it is about senate bills but they
 
06:45:56.548 --> 06:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
seem to take longer than house bills we
 
06:45:58.310 --> 06:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
always get through our public hearings
 
06:45:59.910 --> 06:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
on time but
 
06:46:01.510 --> 06:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
senate bills i don't know we just don't
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
seem to be able to make it
 
06:46:04.788 --> 06:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman senator david
 
06:46:06.390 --> 06:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
water district 4 and i just say maybe
 
06:46:07.590 --> 06:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's just because the senators don't
 
06:46:08.788 --> 06:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing
 
06:46:11.910 --> 06:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:13.350 --> 06:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
you have to clean up our messes all
 
06:46:13.360 --> 06:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
you have to clean up our messes all
right

06:46:14.390 --> 06:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:46:16.390 --> 06:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
um well thank you thank you mr chairman
 
06:46:17.910 --> 06:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
i am senator david waters district 4
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill 448 ready ready
 
06:46:23.270 --> 06:46:23.280 align:start position:0%

06:46:25.030 --> 06:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:46:27.750 --> 06:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the bill does two things uh the first
 
06:46:30.628 --> 06:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
part of the bill is a kind of a clean up
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
on our existing policy established by a
 
06:46:35.670 --> 06:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
series of executive orders about the um
 
06:46:35.680 --> 06:46:37.110 align:start position:0%
series of executive orders about the um
state

06:46:37.110 --> 06:46:37.120 align:start position:0%

committee
 
06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see here this executive
 
06:46:44.070 --> 06:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
order began in 2004
 
06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
have continued been renewed for
 
06:46:48.788 --> 06:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
four times and they have certain goals
 
06:46:51.110 --> 06:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
so what has changed here is just to
 
06:46:52.788 --> 06:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
clean up do some cleanup on reporting
 
06:46:52.798 --> 06:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
clean up do some cleanup on reporting

06:46:53.910 --> 06:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
06:46:56.070 --> 06:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh line 13 you'll see
 
06:46:59.110 --> 06:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
and then line 18 on the first page um
 
06:46:59.120 --> 06:47:00.070 align:start position:0%
and then line 18 on the first page um
about

06:47:00.070 --> 06:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:47:02.230 --> 06:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
when this report should be done and uh
 
06:47:03.270 --> 06:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
to whom
 
06:47:04.868 --> 06:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
they should
 
06:47:06.390 --> 06:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh should go
 
06:47:06.400 --> 06:47:07.830 align:start position:0%
uh should go
um

06:47:07.830 --> 06:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:09.750 --> 06:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that continue the
 
06:47:12.230 --> 06:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
language at the top of page 2 is the
 
06:47:15.430 --> 06:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
governing language for
 
06:47:18.708 --> 06:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
the economic benefits of what the state
 
06:47:20.390 --> 06:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
energy committee
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
has done
 
06:47:24.708 --> 06:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
and this is in the this is language from
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
the executive orders so there's nothing
 
06:47:28.230 --> 06:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
really new
 
06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh there and um just to note uh that
 
06:47:34.150 --> 06:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
this program has saved over 50 million
 
06:47:35.670 --> 06:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
dollars for the state of new hampshire
 
06:47:38.070 --> 06:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we've achieved for
 
06:47:41.190 --> 06:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and transitioning
 
06:47:43.270 --> 06:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh through energy conservation
 
06:47:45.030 --> 06:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh strategic electrification and you
 
06:47:46.708 --> 06:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
know all the kinds of things that we see
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
for administrative services in the
 
06:47:51.190 --> 06:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
um capital budget every year to try to
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
you know refit our buildings and so on
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
so it's been a a good
 
06:47:56.628 --> 06:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh savings effort
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the bill is an
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to extend
 
06:48:02.310 --> 06:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
the capacity to save the state money
 
06:48:02.320 --> 06:48:03.510 align:start position:0%
the capacity to save the state money
through

06:48:03.510 --> 06:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
looking at and planning for the
 
06:48:08.150 --> 06:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
transition of the state vehicle fleet to
 
06:48:08.160 --> 06:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
transition of the state vehicle fleet to
electric

06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
electric
 
06:48:09.520 --> 06:48:10.628 align:start position:0%
electric
vehicles

06:48:10.628 --> 06:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
06:48:10.638 --> 06:48:11.990 align:start position:0%
vehicles
and

06:48:11.990 --> 06:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:48:14.788 --> 06:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
what you'll see starting on page two on
 
06:48:16.868 --> 06:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
06:48:19.110 --> 06:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
are some definitions of light
 
06:48:21.110 --> 06:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
duty trucks and passenger vehicles and
 
06:48:23.110 --> 06:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
then a little bit later on you'll see a
 
06:48:24.468 --> 06:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
06:48:28.390 --> 06:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
heavy duty trucks as as well
 
06:48:32.390 --> 06:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and starting at the bottom of page two
 
06:48:32.400 --> 06:48:33.190 align:start position:0%
and starting at the bottom of page two
it

06:48:33.190 --> 06:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:48:35.910 --> 06:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
says that as the state is purchasing
 
06:48:37.510 --> 06:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
releasing vehicles
 
06:48:37.520 --> 06:48:39.030 align:start position:0%
releasing vehicles
let's

06:48:39.030 --> 06:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
let's
 
06:48:40.788 --> 06:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
get the lowest emission vehicles
 
06:48:43.590 --> 06:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
available and then important words get
 
06:48:45.990 --> 06:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
repeated again and again on the bill to
 
06:48:49.190 --> 06:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
extend feasible feasible practicable and
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
cost effective based on total cost of
 
06:48:53.910 --> 06:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
ownership exclusive of the cost of
 
06:48:56.070 --> 06:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
energy vehicle supply equipment using
 
06:48:58.310 --> 06:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
projected actual ownership time and
 
06:49:01.670 --> 06:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
miles driven per year
 
06:49:04.230 --> 06:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
so the heart of it is there it says
 
06:49:06.708 --> 06:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are there we can help
 
06:49:09.030 --> 06:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
meet energy consumption reduction goals
 
06:49:11.190 --> 06:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
by transitioning to them as it's
 
06:49:13.030 --> 06:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
practical and feasible and
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
cost-effective for various classes of
 
06:49:14.638 --> 06:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
cost-effective for various classes of
vehicles

06:49:15.670 --> 06:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
06:49:17.270 --> 06:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
um because you know certainly there are
 
06:49:18.948 --> 06:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
some classes of vehicles this you know
 
06:49:21.350 --> 06:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
right now might the cost of the the cost
 
06:49:22.788 --> 06:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
in there or the kind of vehicle that's
 
06:49:24.788 --> 06:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
being used isn't isn't there and
 
06:49:26.390 --> 06:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
considering a lot of our heavy duty
 
06:49:28.548 --> 06:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles have 20 30-year life spans it's
 
06:49:31.510 --> 06:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
gonna be a long a long period of
 
06:49:31.520 --> 06:49:33.270 align:start position:0%
gonna be a long a long period of
transition

06:49:33.270 --> 06:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
transition
 
06:49:35.110 --> 06:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
part of the timeliness of the bill is
 
06:49:38.390 --> 06:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
that for the last couple of years now
 
06:49:41.110 --> 06:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state fleet index which is produced
 
06:49:42.868 --> 06:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
each year through administrative
 
06:49:44.948 --> 06:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
services and the fleet manager which
 
06:49:47.430 --> 06:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
lists the vehicles that may be purchased
 
06:49:48.708 --> 06:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
06:49:51.670 --> 06:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
and lists them in rank order of the best
 
06:49:53.670 --> 06:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
bang for the buck and for the last you
 
06:49:56.070 --> 06:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
know last year the top two vehicles were
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
and um so it's clearly right now the
 
06:50:02.548 --> 06:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
total cost of ownership and um you know
 
06:50:04.468 --> 06:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
including operations savings on fuel
 
06:50:07.270 --> 06:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
saving guns maintenance and so on that
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've overcome the differential there
 
06:50:10.788 --> 06:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
may be because some of these vehicles
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
are a little more um expensive
 
06:50:15.270 --> 06:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
now um
 
06:50:15.280 --> 06:50:16.070 align:start position:0%
now um
so

06:50:16.070 --> 06:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:18.230 --> 06:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
the other part of uh this you'll see it
 
06:50:20.868 --> 06:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
can continue going into the
 
06:50:22.948 --> 06:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
into page
 
06:50:25.430 --> 06:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
three uh is the planning
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
function of this
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh and a large part of the reason for
 
06:50:31.510 --> 06:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is that under the state energy
 
06:50:33.190 --> 06:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee right now
 
06:50:35.270 --> 06:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
there is not the capacity to bring all
 
06:50:37.110 --> 06:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
the agencies together that are
 
06:50:39.110 --> 06:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing or leasing vehicles and say
 
06:50:40.948 --> 06:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
let's plan together
 
06:50:42.868 --> 06:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
not just so that we can rationalize
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
where we're going in a vehicle fleet but
 
06:50:46.708 --> 06:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
we've got to be able to plan rationally
 
06:50:49.270 --> 06:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
for the charging infrastructure that we
 
06:50:51.510 --> 06:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
are going going to need and so that's
 
06:50:52.948 --> 06:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
the reason for
 
06:50:55.750 --> 06:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
um asking agencies to make plans about
 
06:50:57.270 --> 06:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know what what do you what do you
 
06:50:58.628 --> 06:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
foresee for when you're going to want to
 
06:51:00.070 --> 06:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
purchase what kind of vehicles how many
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
are going out of service how many are
 
06:51:03.990 --> 06:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know getting certain age or what are
 
06:51:06.390 --> 06:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
the what type are they and then if you
 
06:51:08.468 --> 06:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
were to transition those to
 
06:51:10.150 --> 06:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
electric if those you know practical
 
06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
feasible etc and what kind of charging
 
06:51:12.320 --> 06:51:13.670 align:start position:0%
feasible etc and what kind of charging
infrastructure

06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
06:51:16.468 --> 06:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
are you going uh going to need and um
 
06:51:18.390 --> 06:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
that that those plans would then feed in
 
06:51:20.070 --> 06:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
as they do now for state vehicle
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
purchases into the um
 
06:51:24.150 --> 06:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
into the capital budget where we
 
06:51:25.910 --> 06:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
determine such things
 
06:51:27.750 --> 06:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
um then
 
06:51:29.670 --> 06:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is the charging
 
06:51:32.070 --> 06:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure
 
06:51:33.350 --> 06:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:51:35.350 --> 06:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
so we need to provide charging
 
06:51:37.750 --> 06:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for our state agencies so
 
06:51:39.030 --> 06:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
if they get these vehicles we've got a
 
06:51:40.788 --> 06:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
little bit now
 
06:51:43.030 --> 06:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
and so let me address that when we had
 
06:51:44.390 --> 06:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
the volkswagen
 
06:51:46.230 --> 06:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
fund settlement
 
06:51:48.310 --> 06:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
the governor determined that the maximum
 
06:51:50.708 --> 06:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
amount possible that we could spend
 
06:51:52.230 --> 06:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
legally under that settlement that could
 
06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
go to electric vehicle infrastructure
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
would go to that point and i think that
 
06:51:59.270 --> 06:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
was a wise forward-looking decision i
 
06:52:01.350 --> 06:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
applaud the governor for that and so
 
06:52:04.230 --> 06:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
there is funding there for state agency
 
06:52:06.628 --> 06:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
06:52:09.990 --> 06:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have received an infrastructure bill
 
06:52:12.230 --> 06:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
an additional 17 million dollars which
 
06:52:14.310 --> 06:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
is the state of new hampshire's
 
06:52:16.868 --> 06:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
part of the bucket for
 
06:52:19.750 --> 06:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging infrastructure
 
06:52:19.760 --> 06:52:20.468 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging infrastructure
in

06:52:20.468 --> 06:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:52:21.910 --> 06:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
another committee i have a bill that's
 
06:52:23.750 --> 06:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
setting up a fund for our receiving that
 
06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
fund and uh
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
as using the governor's criteria directs
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
how that money's going to go and a big
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
portion of that is going to go to state
 
06:52:33.750 --> 06:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
agencies so they can get this
 
06:52:33.760 --> 06:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
agencies so they can get this
infrastructure

06:52:35.510 --> 06:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
06:52:38.070 --> 06:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
built in addition to that there is also
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure built 2.5 to 5 billion
 
06:52:43.190 --> 06:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollar grant program that in the state
 
06:52:44.468 --> 06:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire will be able to apply
 
06:52:44.478 --> 06:52:45.590 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire will be able to apply
to

06:52:45.590 --> 06:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:52:48.070 --> 06:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
in a large a big part of that is also
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
for electric vehicle
 
06:52:50.160 --> 06:52:51.590 align:start position:0%
for electric vehicle
infrastructure

06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
06:52:53.030 --> 06:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
not just along our state vehicle
 
06:52:57.030 --> 06:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
corridors but also for state agency use
 
06:52:59.430 --> 06:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
so it's important to note that the bill
 
06:52:59.440 --> 06:53:00.230 align:start position:0%
so it's important to note that the bill
then

06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:53:01.990 --> 06:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
says the planning is not that we're
 
06:53:04.708 --> 06:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
going to try to you know bust the budget
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be having to pay
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
for all this infrastructure but that
 
06:53:09.750 --> 06:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
we've got funding there's a flow of
 
06:53:11.910 --> 06:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
funding coming in so that if we
 
06:53:13.270 --> 06:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
rationally plan
 
06:53:14.628 --> 06:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
um we can
 
06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
we can do do this um the amount of money
 
06:53:19.750 --> 06:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we potentially can save per vehicle
 
06:53:22.230 --> 06:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
um i've seen estimates of some like ten
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a typical light
 
06:53:26.390 --> 06:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
duty vehicle you're gonna save
 
06:53:28.230 --> 06:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
um moving forward i think for the heavy
 
06:53:30.628 --> 06:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
duty vehicles when we get to that point
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
the subs these savings are going to be
 
06:53:34.310 --> 06:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
much much more
 
06:53:36.548 --> 06:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh substantial
 
06:53:39.190 --> 06:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
but again practical reasonable
 
06:53:39.200 --> 06:53:40.468 align:start position:0%
but again practical reasonable
um

06:53:40.468 --> 06:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:42.708 --> 06:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
feasible for vehicle class
 
06:53:45.990 --> 06:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and cost effective um with it
 
06:53:48.468 --> 06:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
so the last part of the bill
 
06:53:48.478 --> 06:53:50.070 align:start position:0%
so the last part of the bill
um

06:53:50.070 --> 06:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
says okay uh
 
06:53:53.030 --> 06:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:53:54.150 --> 06:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to receive your plans
 
06:53:55.910 --> 06:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to be reviewed
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to see what is good to go
 
06:53:58.548 --> 06:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
what is operational and we're going to
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
get reports
 
06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
about how this is how this is going and
 
06:54:04.468 --> 06:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
of course through the capital
 
06:54:06.868 --> 06:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
budget program that's another chance for
 
06:54:09.030 --> 06:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature to scrutinize how this
 
06:54:10.230 --> 06:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
is being done
 
06:54:12.150 --> 06:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'll say one final word on the physical
 
06:54:12.160 --> 06:54:13.350 align:start position:0%
i'll say one final word on the physical
note

06:54:13.350 --> 06:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
note
 
06:54:13.360 --> 06:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
note
um

06:54:14.390 --> 06:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:14.400 --> 06:54:15.270 align:start position:0%
um
that

06:54:15.270 --> 06:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:54:16.628 --> 06:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
you know part of the issue of the fiscal
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
note uh it did not and you know it says
 
06:54:21.030 --> 06:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're going to spend some we're
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to be you know charging costs
 
06:54:24.868 --> 06:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
especially if you're doing dc fast
 
06:54:28.390 --> 06:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
chargers those are very expensive
 
06:54:30.310 --> 06:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
and they have to you know be used for
 
06:54:32.390 --> 06:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
fast charging and also for heavy
 
06:54:34.788 --> 06:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
duty vehicles i could see some vehicles
 
06:54:36.070 --> 06:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
where you've got to get them back right
 
06:54:38.150 --> 06:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
back on the road after 15 20 minutes a
 
06:54:40.230 --> 06:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
half an hour to get the charge back fast
 
06:54:42.310 --> 06:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
charger is good heavy duty vehicle
 
06:54:43.190 --> 06:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
because they're drawing so much
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
electricity fast charge is good a lot of
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
light duty vehicles though are going to
 
06:54:47.760 --> 06:54:48.548 align:start position:0%
light duty vehicles though are going to
be

06:54:48.548 --> 06:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:54:51.830 --> 06:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
um level two charging and those
 
06:54:53.990 --> 06:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know 600 dollars to fourteen hundred
 
06:54:55.430 --> 06:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
dollars to put in
 
06:54:58.310 --> 06:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
um uh charging for that and um that's
 
06:55:01.110 --> 06:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
what we have already a little bit up to
 
06:55:02.948 --> 06:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
go to the state office park or over here
 
06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
to green street where those were
 
06:55:07.270 --> 06:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh put in by the des and um those are
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
much much less expensive so um
 
06:55:12.548 --> 06:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
you know i suppose it's gonna say
 
06:55:14.230 --> 06:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's some unknowns out there that the
 
06:55:16.310 --> 06:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
this you know the the ground is shifting
 
06:55:18.628 --> 06:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
here we know that the major auto
 
06:55:20.310 --> 06:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the united states have
 
06:55:21.910 --> 06:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
said that they're gonna phase out any
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
production of conventionally fueled
 
06:55:26.230 --> 06:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles by 2030 2035.
 
06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
the european nations have passed laws
 
06:55:30.788 --> 06:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
saying that's the case massachusetts is
 
06:55:32.948 --> 06:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
contemplating laws saying by 2035 you
 
06:55:34.468 --> 06:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
can't buy
 
06:55:34.478 --> 06:55:35.350 align:start position:0%
can't buy
a

06:55:35.350 --> 06:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
conventionally fueled vehicle um so we
 
06:55:39.910 --> 06:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
know that all the new models that are
 
06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
coming out and the costs will come down
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
because of that there'll be many more we
 
06:55:44.628 --> 06:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
know in the heavy duty vehicles sue
 
06:55:46.310 --> 06:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
cummings the largest manufacturers of
 
06:55:46.320 --> 06:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
cummings the largest manufacturers of
diesel

06:55:47.190 --> 06:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
diesel
 
06:55:48.788 --> 06:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
engine in the united states has said
 
06:55:51.430 --> 06:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're going all-electric um peterbilt
 
06:55:54.390 --> 06:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
mack lyon the other the other big ones
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh are saying they're heading this
 
06:55:58.150 --> 06:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
direction too so i suspect we see a lot
 
06:56:00.150 --> 06:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
of good usable uh vehicles of various
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
classes the price will be coming down so
 
06:56:04.310 --> 06:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
um let's do some rational planning thank
 
06:56:06.628 --> 06:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
06:56:07.990 --> 06:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
06:56:09.350 --> 06:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think we have quite a few questions
 
06:56:11.190 --> 06:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
for you about this bill we'll start with
 
06:56:14.070 --> 06:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative callie pitts
 
06:56:16.830 --> 06:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator waters
 
06:56:16.840 --> 06:56:18.548 align:start position:0%
thank you senator waters
um

06:56:18.548 --> 06:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:21.190 --> 06:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the fleet is
 
06:56:22.628 --> 06:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
now being
 
06:56:25.110 --> 06:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
replaced with electric vehicles where
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible and that that was the order
 
06:56:27.840 --> 06:56:28.948 align:start position:0%
possible and that that was the order
i

06:56:28.948 --> 06:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:56:28.958 --> 06:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
i
i

06:56:29.750 --> 06:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:56:33.830 --> 06:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
looked at the fiscal note of 96
 
06:56:37.190 --> 06:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
what is it 96 000 to 447
 
06:56:41.030 --> 06:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
37 000 to replace the stations
 
06:56:41.040 --> 06:56:41.910 align:start position:0%
37 000 to replace the stations
uh

06:56:41.910 --> 06:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:56:44.708 --> 06:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
have we thought at all in conjunction
 
06:56:47.110 --> 06:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
with all the departments have we thought
 
06:56:47.120 --> 06:56:48.390 align:start position:0%
with all the departments have we thought
about

06:56:48.390 --> 06:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
producing our own electricity on sites
 
06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
where these are going to be
 
06:56:58.310 --> 06:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
charged so i would imagine
 
06:57:00.390 --> 06:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
check me if i'm wrong
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know much about the vehicles
 
06:57:04.150 --> 06:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
except when i see them i want them to
 
06:57:04.160 --> 06:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
except when i see them i want them to
operate

06:57:05.270 --> 06:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
operate
 
06:57:05.280 --> 06:57:06.708 align:start position:0%
operate
um

06:57:06.708 --> 06:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:09.270 --> 06:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
places where they're going to be charged
 
06:57:11.350 --> 06:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
will be
 
06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
stationed so they wouldn't be just
 
06:57:13.360 --> 06:57:14.628 align:start position:0%
stationed so they wouldn't be just
one

06:57:14.628 --> 06:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:57:17.430 --> 06:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
you'd be charging dot station across
 
06:57:19.670 --> 06:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
from my house has several trucks and
 
06:57:22.628 --> 06:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
other utility vehicles anything about
 
06:57:24.548 --> 06:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
putting in perhaps solar powered
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
charging stations and batteries in there
 
06:57:29.190 --> 06:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
so that we do the whole enchilada all at
 
06:57:31.750 --> 06:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
once instead of doing it piecemeal
 
06:57:32.788 --> 06:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
well thanks
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
for the several questions there and i'll
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
try to get through them
 
06:57:39.350 --> 06:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes some electric vehicles are being
 
06:57:41.110 --> 06:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
bought by the state
 
06:57:43.110 --> 06:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's no program to do that
 
06:57:45.190 --> 06:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no plan there's no
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan to do it
 
06:57:49.590 --> 06:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill is here
 
06:57:51.270 --> 06:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
i wrote it you know i worked with
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
administrative services fleet manager
 
06:57:54.948 --> 06:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years on on these
 
06:57:56.948 --> 06:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
issues and this will be very
 
06:57:59.350 --> 06:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful to them
 
06:58:02.150 --> 06:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
to get various agencies to come together
 
06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and do this rationally and also
 
06:58:04.000 --> 06:58:05.590 align:start position:0%
and do this rationally and also
purchasing

06:58:05.590 --> 06:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
06:58:07.830 --> 06:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
cooperatively so that they can get
 
06:58:10.590 --> 06:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
better deals let us note as well that
 
06:58:13.430 --> 06:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities can buy
 
06:58:15.190 --> 06:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
their vehicles
 
06:58:17.990 --> 06:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the state fleet price
 
06:58:20.230 --> 06:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that you know we have an opportunity
 
06:58:22.150 --> 06:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
there to help our local municipalities
 
06:58:24.628 --> 06:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
and i just as an aside we'll say that
 
06:58:25.830 --> 06:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
some of the funding we're getting from
 
06:58:27.590 --> 06:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure fund is going to help
 
06:58:29.190 --> 06:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
is going to provide municipalities with
 
06:58:29.200 --> 06:58:30.230 align:start position:0%
is going to provide municipalities with
charging

06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
charging
 
06:58:32.468 --> 06:58:32.478 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure and that funding we
 
06:58:33.830 --> 06:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
have and the
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
247 another committee is going to you
 
06:58:39.830 --> 06:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
know authorizes uh that
 
06:58:42.150 --> 06:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
um now the second thing you mentioned
 
06:58:43.830 --> 06:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
that ninety six thousand dollar figure i
 
06:58:45.350 --> 06:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
tried to mention well you know there's
 
06:58:46.948 --> 06:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
two things about that they just went to
 
06:58:49.030 --> 06:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
the fast charge model we're gonna need
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
some fast charging dc fast charging
 
06:58:53.190 --> 06:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
they're pretty expensive stations to to
 
06:58:55.030 --> 06:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
put in but we're going to need a lot
 
06:58:57.110 --> 06:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
more that are the the cheaper ones to
 
06:58:58.150 --> 06:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
put in
 
06:59:00.230 --> 06:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
but the point is that we're not going to
 
06:59:02.708 --> 06:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
spend money we don't have we have money
 
06:59:04.868 --> 06:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
coming in for charging infrastructure if
 
06:59:07.350 --> 06:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
we plan for it we can rationally decide
 
06:59:08.548 --> 06:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
where it should go how it's going to be
 
06:59:08.558 --> 06:59:09.750 align:start position:0%
where it should go how it's going to be
used

06:59:09.750 --> 06:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
used
 
06:59:11.110 --> 06:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
now in terms of generation of
 
06:59:12.628 --> 06:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
electricity i don't know we're hearing
 
06:59:14.150 --> 06:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
about these bills all the time community
 
06:59:15.510 --> 06:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
solar is this and that and the other
 
06:59:16.948 --> 06:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
thing and uh
 
06:59:19.110 --> 06:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
i mean beats me you know i i think we
 
06:59:20.788 --> 06:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
get we have some pretty good big
 
06:59:22.548 --> 06:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
generators uh in the state like
 
06:59:24.070 --> 06:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
eversource and so on that produce
 
06:59:26.230 --> 06:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
electricity and uh
 
06:59:29.270 --> 06:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
one side about though is that what these
 
06:59:32.310 --> 06:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
what we're moving towards is vehicle to
 
06:59:34.788 --> 06:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
grid technology
 
06:59:36.548 --> 06:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
so that if you have a large fleet and i
 
06:59:37.830 --> 06:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned merchants fleet there
 
06:59:38.788 --> 06:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
merchants fleet i don't know if they're
 
06:59:40.310 --> 06:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
the largest fleet company in the country
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
but they're based here in new hampshire
 
06:59:44.150 --> 06:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're going all electric okay so you
 
06:59:46.150 --> 06:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
know fleet managers see this is really a
 
06:59:48.310 --> 06:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
way to go and another part of if you do
 
06:59:50.708 --> 06:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle to grid technology you can
 
06:59:52.310 --> 06:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
charge them up
 
06:59:55.270 --> 06:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
when the electricity is cheap i saw last
 
06:59:57.190 --> 06:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
week sometime that the we're in a
 
06:59:58.868 --> 06:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
negative cost of electricity during the
 
07:00:00.468 --> 07:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
day because so much was being produced
 
07:00:00.478 --> 07:00:01.270 align:start position:0%
day because so much was being produced
right

07:00:01.270 --> 07:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:00:02.868 --> 07:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
charge them up then
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
and then we hit those peaks we just
 
07:00:06.310 --> 07:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
heard about the cat's ears and the ducks
 
07:00:07.750 --> 07:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff
 
07:00:09.750 --> 07:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
right um then at that point you can sell
 
07:00:12.150 --> 07:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
it back into the grid you can monetize
 
07:00:14.150 --> 07:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
your battery storage capacity that's why
 
07:00:16.628 --> 07:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
merchants fleet and that's why
 
07:00:18.788 --> 07:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know we have another bill
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
another committee about electric school
 
07:00:21.990 --> 07:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
bus pilot program that has a provision
 
07:00:23.430 --> 07:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
there that you could do the vehicle to
 
07:00:23.440 --> 07:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
there that you could do the vehicle to
grid

07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
grid
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
07:00:27.510 --> 07:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're just getting started this bill
 
07:00:30.390 --> 07:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
says a lot is happening let's plan let's
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
do it cost effectively
 
07:00:34.390 --> 07:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
and this will help the state move
 
07:00:34.400 --> 07:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
and this will help the state move
forward

07:00:36.150 --> 07:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
07:00:38.628 --> 07:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative berezni has a question
 
07:00:40.468 --> 07:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you senator
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
waters for taking my question you
 
07:00:44.390 --> 07:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the costs will come down
 
07:00:45.590 --> 07:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
over time
 
07:00:45.600 --> 07:00:46.390 align:start position:0%
over time
uh

07:00:46.390 --> 07:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:00:48.468 --> 07:00:48.478 align:start position:0%
what's the downside of being late to the
 
07:00:50.230 --> 07:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
game on this and waiting until there's
 
07:00:53.750 --> 07:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
more private charging stations thank you
 
07:00:55.030 --> 07:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question i mean
 
07:00:56.948 --> 07:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
we're building out charging stations but
 
07:00:58.548 --> 07:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
you know state fleeters we've got a
 
07:01:00.310 --> 07:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
state fleet voter provide for charging
 
07:01:02.548 --> 07:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
right i mean we fuel the state fleet now
 
07:01:05.350 --> 07:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
um so that that's why and the thing is
 
07:01:05.360 --> 07:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
um so that that's why and the thing is
um

07:01:07.830 --> 07:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:09.510 --> 07:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know the their cost they're cost
 
07:01:11.430 --> 07:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
effective now i mean right now they're
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
the top two vehicles on the list
 
07:01:16.628 --> 07:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
um so i don't you know we can get going
 
07:01:17.670 --> 07:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
07:01:19.430 --> 07:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the what they call the learning you
 
07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
know the more units produced the more
 
07:01:22.708 --> 07:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
the cost comes down
 
07:01:24.628 --> 07:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
we're just about to hit the point with
 
07:01:25.990 --> 07:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
some vehicles where there's no cost
 
07:01:27.510 --> 07:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
differential between the electric and
 
07:01:28.868 --> 07:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
the conventionally
 
07:01:30.390 --> 07:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
fueled and i think we're going to see
 
07:01:30.400 --> 07:01:31.190 align:start position:0%
fueled and i think we're going to see
that

07:01:31.190 --> 07:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:34.070 --> 07:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
a lot more um so i i don't really see a
 
07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
reason why there'd be an advantage to us
 
07:01:36.000 --> 07:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
reason why there'd be an advantage to us
uh

07:01:37.190 --> 07:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:01:40.868 --> 07:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:42.868 --> 07:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative harrington and thank you
 
07:01:44.390 --> 07:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you senator for taking
 
07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
my question senator i inadvertently
 
07:01:48.948 --> 07:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
turned off your microphone
 
07:01:51.670 --> 07:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh on the bottom of page
 
07:01:54.628 --> 07:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
two as you rightly pointed out on
 
07:01:56.708 --> 07:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
line 34 talks about to the extent
 
07:01:58.390 --> 07:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
feasible practical and cost effect
 
07:02:00.070 --> 07:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
effective based on total cost of
 
07:02:00.080 --> 07:02:01.190 align:start position:0%
effective based on total cost of
ownership

07:02:01.190 --> 07:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
07:02:01.200 --> 07:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
ownership
and

07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:02:04.310 --> 07:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
then we get over to page three
 
07:02:06.788 --> 07:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
and you kind of do the same thing but we
 
07:02:08.708 --> 07:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
leave out that cost effective part on
 
07:02:10.868 --> 07:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
line eight with the ability the vehicles
 
07:02:13.030 --> 07:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
to perform the intended function
 
07:02:13.040 --> 07:02:13.910 align:start position:0%
to perform the intended function
and

07:02:13.910 --> 07:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:02:15.830 --> 07:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have that cost effective based
 
07:02:18.390 --> 07:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
on total total ownership there
 
07:02:20.948 --> 07:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
and then on line 18 again we have to the
 
07:02:23.590 --> 07:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
extent feasible but cost effective gets
 
07:02:24.948 --> 07:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
left out
 
07:02:28.628 --> 07:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.310 --> 07:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
where was this next one here
 
07:02:33.990 --> 07:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the line 32 to the extent feasible
 
07:02:36.230 --> 07:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
and again cost effective is left out any
 
07:02:37.830 --> 07:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
reason why it was left out in those
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
three places and it was put in the other
 
07:02:39.360 --> 07:02:40.468 align:start position:0%
three places and it was put in the other
one

07:02:40.468 --> 07:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:02:43.750 --> 07:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to be almost like the same line
 
07:02:46.150 --> 07:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
to the extent feasible is used in
 
07:02:49.430 --> 07:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:49.440 --> 07:02:50.468 align:start position:0%
 
well

07:02:50.468 --> 07:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you want a belt and
 
07:02:54.070 --> 07:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
suspenders did why not
 
07:02:55.510 --> 07:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to state spending yeah
 
07:02:57.190 --> 07:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean no i mean really i i mean
 
07:02:59.350 --> 07:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
the cost effective to me i think this is
 
07:03:01.670 --> 07:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
a non-starter if we can't demonstrate
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's cost effective okay you know i mean
 
07:03:05.910 --> 07:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i like to save the state money it's
 
07:03:07.590 --> 07:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money right it's not my money
 
07:03:10.150 --> 07:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's taxpayer money and so um i think in
 
07:03:12.150 --> 07:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
some places i didn't do that because
 
07:03:14.948 --> 07:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
like on line 32 it says such plans the
 
07:03:16.230 --> 07:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
cost of electric vehicle supply
 
07:03:18.070 --> 07:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
committed and so on and so forth but i i
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
think in detail counter than cost
 
07:03:22.788 --> 07:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
analysis so um but i think the more we
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
put in cost effective please please add
 
07:03:26.310 --> 07:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
it if you think that would help thank
 
07:03:30.310 --> 07:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:33.190 --> 07:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
who's next representative lewicki
 
07:03:34.948 --> 07:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
um one would
 
07:03:38.310 --> 07:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
expect that state vehicles are going to
 
07:03:39.910 --> 07:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
be used primarily during the day and
 
07:03:41.590 --> 07:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
they aren't going to be able to you know
 
07:03:43.350 --> 07:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
do we really want our state employees oh
 
07:03:45.750 --> 07:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'd take a however long break while my
 
07:03:47.670 --> 07:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charges
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
so most of them are probably going to
 
07:03:51.270 --> 07:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
get charged at the end of the day
 
07:03:52.948 --> 07:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
and that would then
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh as in the previous bill
 
07:03:57.670 --> 07:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
we have the issue of uh increasing load
 
07:03:59.830 --> 07:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
on the grid so they would probably want
 
07:04:02.070 --> 07:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
to put them on timers would we not
 
07:04:03.190 --> 07:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
so that they're getting charged in the
 
07:04:04.628 --> 07:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
middle of the night
 
07:04:07.510 --> 07:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question and um a
 
07:04:10.628 --> 07:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
couple answers to it uh i say yes and no
 
07:04:13.990 --> 07:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
um in that you know these vehicle range
 
07:04:17.430 --> 07:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
250 300 miles 350 miles
 
07:04:19.190 --> 07:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
um so you could kind of figure out it's
 
07:04:20.548 --> 07:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
like you know it's like your cell phone
 
07:04:21.830 --> 07:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
you don't wait until it gets all the way
 
07:04:23.430 --> 07:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
to the bottom every time
 
07:04:25.110 --> 07:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
right if you've come in off you're
 
07:04:26.708 --> 07:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
running your route you throw a little
 
07:04:28.708 --> 07:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
charge into it right so i think there'll
 
07:04:29.990 --> 07:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
be some of that
 
07:04:32.070 --> 07:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
but i bring this out too because they'll
 
07:04:33.990 --> 07:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a computer that does it but they
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
will be able to track for every vehicle
 
07:04:38.310 --> 07:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
that might be plugged in everywhere at
 
07:04:40.708 --> 07:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
that moment what the cost of electricity
 
07:04:43.430 --> 07:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
is and you can actually automate it so
 
07:04:45.670 --> 07:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
that it pulls it in only when it's using
 
07:04:48.070 --> 07:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
less expensive electricity
 
07:04:50.468 --> 07:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
um and then the advantage is that if you
 
07:04:51.750 --> 07:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know let's say you're leaving it
 
07:04:51.760 --> 07:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
you know let's say you're leaving it
overnight

07:04:53.270 --> 07:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
07:04:54.868 --> 07:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
the vehicle comes in at four or five
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock we're hitting peak demand
 
07:04:59.110 --> 07:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
do the vehicle to grid pull some power
 
07:05:00.230 --> 07:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
07:05:02.468 --> 07:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
we get to 4 a.m in the morning
 
07:05:02.478 --> 07:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
we get to 4 a.m in the morning
um

07:05:03.910 --> 07:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:05.990 --> 07:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
power's cheap again charge it up so it's
 
07:05:07.750 --> 07:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
good to go in the morning you can
 
07:05:09.270 --> 07:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
already i mean i i can already do that
 
07:05:11.910 --> 07:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
with my car you can do that so um this
 
07:05:13.430 --> 07:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
is what we're you know
 
07:05:15.670 --> 07:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is management of of it once you
 
07:05:17.190 --> 07:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
have it and i think there will be ways
 
07:05:17.200 --> 07:05:17.910 align:start position:0%
have it and i think there will be ways
to

07:05:17.910 --> 07:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:05:20.390 --> 07:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
to monetize the batteries themselves and
 
07:05:22.708 --> 07:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
to take care of you know figuring out
 
07:05:24.070 --> 07:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
the charging schedule for a given
 
07:05:24.080 --> 07:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
the charging schedule for a given
vehicle

07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
07:05:27.750 --> 07:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
07:05:30.390 --> 07:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
07:05:34.548 --> 07:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
07:05:36.070 --> 07:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
right up front i want to say i think
 
07:05:37.510 --> 07:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is a great bill and a great
 
07:05:39.350 --> 07:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
initiative and i think the state should
 
07:05:41.030 --> 07:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
lead the way on this
 
07:05:43.190 --> 07:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
but i also agree that it needs to be
 
07:05:46.070 --> 07:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
feasible and economically viable to do
 
07:05:46.080 --> 07:05:46.868 align:start position:0%
feasible and economically viable to do
it

07:05:46.868 --> 07:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:05:49.750 --> 07:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i i'll likewise assume that that
 
07:05:53.190 --> 07:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
will be a test that will be used
 
07:05:54.948 --> 07:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
i want to point out one thing however
 
07:05:57.270 --> 07:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how that folds into
 
07:05:59.670 --> 07:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
this issue but
 
07:06:01.750 --> 07:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
what about the cost of the actual
 
07:06:04.708 --> 07:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
electricity involved here because the
 
07:06:06.548 --> 07:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
union of concerned scientists recently
 
07:06:08.788 --> 07:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
reported that these charging stations
 
07:06:10.230 --> 07:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
they can vary in price per kilowatt hour
 
07:06:15.750 --> 07:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically some places are charging
 
07:06:19.190 --> 07:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
like three dollars per kilowatt hour
 
07:06:21.270 --> 07:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
which is a ridiculous price it's like
 
07:06:22.468 --> 07:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
paying 30
 
07:06:24.868 --> 07:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
a gallon for gasoline
 
07:06:27.270 --> 07:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
so the price that's negotiated for the
 
07:06:29.350 --> 07:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
state when they charge these vehicles
 
07:06:31.110 --> 07:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
that will be very critical
 
07:06:33.590 --> 07:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh then you can't get the prices when
 
07:06:36.150 --> 07:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
you go to a charging station off i-93 or
 
07:06:37.830 --> 07:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
07:06:39.670 --> 07:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and um in
 
07:06:41.190 --> 07:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
indeed you're right you know when i
 
07:06:42.868 --> 07:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
charge up at home i figure i'm paying
 
07:06:44.310 --> 07:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of about a dollar ten a
 
07:06:46.948 --> 07:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
gallon i do tonight if i charge up over
 
07:06:49.270 --> 07:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
here in green street at the des facility
 
07:06:51.430 --> 07:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
um depends on time of day you know i get
 
07:06:53.190 --> 07:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
up here i might go over there and park a
 
07:06:55.110 --> 07:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
photo while throwing some charge into it
 
07:06:56.548 --> 07:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
and i might
 
07:06:58.948 --> 07:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
if i get about 50 miles
 
07:07:02.708 --> 07:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
um out of it and i might be paying 2.70
 
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
still a whole lot less than a gallon of
 
07:07:06.628 --> 07:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
gas right now i might i might add
 
07:07:09.590 --> 07:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
to your question particularly though
 
07:07:13.350 --> 07:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
these are going to be state chargers
 
07:07:13.360 --> 07:07:14.310 align:start position:0%
these are going to be state chargers
right

07:07:14.310 --> 07:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:07:16.948 --> 07:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
so the state will be able to negotiate
 
07:07:19.350 --> 07:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
its cost of electricity
 
07:07:21.590 --> 07:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the with the utilities and use the
 
07:07:24.310 --> 07:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
mechanisms i've already described to
 
07:07:29.590 --> 07:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:32.070 --> 07:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you senator do the
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
plans covered by this bill
 
07:07:37.750 --> 07:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
include the building
 
07:07:41.270 --> 07:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for charging stations
 
07:07:43.510 --> 07:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
for example in d.o.t garages you're
 
07:07:44.708 --> 07:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
going to need
 
07:07:47.110 --> 07:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
substantial fire suppression equipment
 
07:07:49.830 --> 07:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
because of the potential for
 
07:07:51.270 --> 07:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
battery fires
 
07:07:54.150 --> 07:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
which could do serious damage to
 
07:07:56.548 --> 07:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
both the building and any vehicles
 
07:07:58.708 --> 07:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
stored within the building so
 
07:08:01.590 --> 07:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:04.548 --> 07:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
take into account those additional costs
 
07:08:08.150 --> 07:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and um
 
07:08:09.270 --> 07:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know if we have
 
07:08:11.110 --> 07:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
somebody here from
 
07:08:12.788 --> 07:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
becky i don't know maybe you can answer
 
07:08:14.708 --> 07:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
some of these things but um you know if
 
07:08:16.948 --> 07:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
you think about it mr chairman um we
 
07:08:18.310 --> 07:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of vehicles that are pretty
 
07:08:19.990 --> 07:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
flammable right now they have a big
 
07:08:22.070 --> 07:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
diesel tank or a big gas tank
 
07:08:24.390 --> 07:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
all right and um the potential there for
 
07:08:28.708 --> 07:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:28.718 --> 07:08:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:08:30.150 --> 07:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:08:32.788 --> 07:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
i think the whole point of the planning
 
07:08:35.750 --> 07:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that these considerations would be
 
07:08:37.670 --> 07:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
there as you're trying to figure out the
 
07:08:37.680 --> 07:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
there as you're trying to figure out the
feasibility

07:08:39.350 --> 07:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
07:08:40.708 --> 07:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
and the cost
 
07:08:40.718 --> 07:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
and the cost
um

07:08:41.750 --> 07:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:43.190 --> 07:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:08:44.788 --> 07:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
the last thing i say about that too is
 
07:08:46.548 --> 07:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
that you know i bet we all saw the
 
07:08:48.468 --> 07:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
picture of that tesla that burst into
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
flames after the crash that was uh that
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
was really something you know i don't
 
07:08:54.948 --> 07:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
know town is a merrimack or somewhere
 
07:08:58.310 --> 07:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
manchester um you know and uh wow you
 
07:09:01.030 --> 07:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
know and if a car burst in the flame wow
 
07:09:01.040 --> 07:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
know and if a car burst in the flame wow
um

07:09:01.990 --> 07:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:05.030 --> 07:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the battery technology is moving rapidly
 
07:09:07.510 --> 07:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
towards um replacing
 
07:09:11.110 --> 07:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
the lithium ion and the nickel
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
system um and uh coming to a battery
 
07:09:16.868 --> 07:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
that won't won't do that in terms of the
 
07:09:18.468 --> 07:09:18.478 align:start position:0%
large storage units i think they've
 
07:09:20.708 --> 07:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
already pretty much gotten to one that
 
07:09:22.788 --> 07:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
does that but they're moving towards um
 
07:09:25.190 --> 07:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
sulfur and graphene batteries uh they're
 
07:09:26.788 --> 07:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
moving towards iron
 
07:09:29.990 --> 07:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
batteries solid-state batteries so um
 
07:09:31.910 --> 07:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'd that's obviously miss
 
07:09:33.430 --> 07:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
chairman a very important issue with the
 
07:09:35.430 --> 07:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
safety around it but i think the
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
industry is moving towards
 
07:09:37.360 --> 07:09:38.150 align:start position:0%
industry is moving towards
um

07:09:38.150 --> 07:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:40.868 --> 07:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
batteries uh that that are addressing
 
07:09:42.070 --> 07:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
any concerns because there have been
 
07:09:43.190 --> 07:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
some huh
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah excellent thank you
 
07:09:46.788 --> 07:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has another
 
07:09:46.798 --> 07:09:47.910 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has another
question

07:09:47.910 --> 07:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:09:50.230 --> 07:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
may sound foolish but it's a question
 
07:09:52.708 --> 07:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
that i'm just wondering about
 
07:09:52.718 --> 07:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
that i'm just wondering about
um

07:09:55.030 --> 07:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:57.270 --> 07:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
i would think we have over a thousand
 
07:09:59.670 --> 07:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the state fleet
 
07:10:01.190 --> 07:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
add some zeros
 
07:10:03.270 --> 07:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
add some zeros okay
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
so my question is basically it and it's
 
07:10:08.310 --> 07:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
a maybe a foolish question does the
 
07:10:09.910 --> 07:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
state pay
 
07:10:15.270 --> 07:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:16.708 --> 07:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
07:10:20.708 --> 07:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
i i i mean i i i guess so i mean why
 
07:10:22.468 --> 07:10:22.478 align:start position:0%
everybody okay the reason i'm i'll tell
 
07:10:24.868 --> 07:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
you the reason i'm wondering is i don't
 
07:10:24.878 --> 07:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
you the reason i'm wondering is i don't
know

07:10:25.670 --> 07:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:10:25.680 --> 07:10:26.628 align:start position:0%
know
but

07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:10:29.270 --> 07:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to eventually in the state
 
07:10:32.310 --> 07:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
have a revenue problem for our roads
 
07:10:35.270 --> 07:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
because of not being collecting state
 
07:10:37.190 --> 07:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
gas taxes so
 
07:10:39.350 --> 07:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if the state pays
 
07:10:42.230 --> 07:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
it and what kind of a impact that would
 
07:10:44.548 --> 07:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
be and that again may sound foolish but
 
07:10:46.150 --> 07:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's just something i've always wondered
 
07:10:46.160 --> 07:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
it's just something i've always wondered
about

07:10:47.670 --> 07:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:10:48.948 --> 07:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
well thank you i should know the answer
 
07:10:50.788 --> 07:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
that i want senate transportation hey
 
07:10:53.510 --> 07:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
but i i my mind is just blank um
 
07:10:55.350 --> 07:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
but you you if you're worried about the
 
07:10:57.510 --> 07:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
the increase in fuel efficiency and what
 
07:10:59.270 --> 07:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are going to do to our
 
07:11:01.270 --> 07:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
revenues join everybody else in the
 
07:11:02.628 --> 07:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
country that's wondering and have a
 
07:11:04.628 --> 07:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
little conversation with representative
 
07:11:04.638 --> 07:11:06.948 align:start position:0%
little conversation with representative
major

07:11:06.948 --> 07:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
major
 
07:11:13.990 --> 07:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:15.670 --> 07:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay we have one other person who would
 
07:11:17.670 --> 07:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
like to testify on this bill so i think
 
07:11:19.510 --> 07:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to
 
07:11:21.990 --> 07:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
invite kelly buchanan to come up
 
07:11:23.990 --> 07:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i ask him one question
 
07:11:25.910 --> 07:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative lang has a question
 
07:11:27.910 --> 07:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
i realize you were even here yeah i i
 
07:11:29.190 --> 07:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
came back i've been listening to my
 
07:11:31.990 --> 07:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
office to the testimony and i came in i
 
07:11:34.230 --> 07:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
so my question is along the lines of
 
07:11:35.750 --> 07:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts is that i'm
 
07:11:37.350 --> 07:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about the number of vehicles
 
07:11:39.910 --> 07:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
we have what it might impact might be on
 
07:11:41.190 --> 07:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
on the roads and the fact that we're
 
07:11:42.868 --> 07:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
going to be reducing our revenues for
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state gas tax but
 
07:11:47.030 --> 07:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
my other question i had was around if
 
07:11:48.628 --> 07:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you said out of zero
 
07:11:50.230 --> 07:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
when she said a thousand so yeah i'm
 
07:11:51.750 --> 07:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
assuming you're talking about ten ten
 
07:11:51.760 --> 07:11:52.948 align:start position:0%
assuming you're talking about ten ten
thousand

07:11:52.948 --> 07:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
07:11:55.110 --> 07:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
i can find out i'm just sorry about that
 
07:11:57.430 --> 07:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is about the grid itself and
 
07:11:59.430 --> 07:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
the implication of adding all of this
 
07:12:02.230 --> 07:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
new consumption on top of existing
 
07:12:05.110 --> 07:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
consumption um and how that plays out
 
07:12:06.708 --> 07:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
especially as it relates to the rate
 
07:12:08.830 --> 07:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
payers if we have to upgrade
 
07:12:11.670 --> 07:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
distribution um in the area due to the
 
07:12:13.430 --> 07:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
increased load necessary for the number
 
07:12:14.788 --> 07:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
of vehicles
 
07:12:16.150 --> 07:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question i'm really glad
 
07:12:17.830 --> 07:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
you brought that up um
 
07:12:19.990 --> 07:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
we know that there is going to be an
 
07:12:22.868 --> 07:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
enormous transition underway in america
 
07:12:24.468 --> 07:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
because of electric vehicles
 
07:12:26.788 --> 07:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
because of electrification of uh home
 
07:12:26.798 --> 07:12:28.948 align:start position:0%
because of electrification of uh home
heating

07:12:28.948 --> 07:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
heating
 
07:12:28.958 --> 07:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
heating
and

07:12:29.990 --> 07:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:12:31.830 --> 07:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
so that you know
 
07:12:35.670 --> 07:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue about generating capacity
 
07:12:38.708 --> 07:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
and distribution this is why there is
 
07:12:40.230 --> 07:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
such enormous
 
07:12:43.110 --> 07:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
impetus behind offshore wind
 
07:12:43.120 --> 07:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
impetus behind offshore wind
because

07:12:44.310 --> 07:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:12:46.868 --> 07:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
there's a plan now 30 gigawatts of
 
07:12:49.750 --> 07:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
offshore wind power by 2030 we're on
 
07:12:52.310 --> 07:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
track for that the gulf of maine task
 
07:12:54.230 --> 07:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
force which i sit on the governor asks
 
07:12:55.350 --> 07:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know call for the establishment the
 
07:12:57.510 --> 07:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
gulf of maine task force for off for
 
07:12:58.868 --> 07:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
07:13:01.350 --> 07:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
um we're meeting again in may
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it looks like leasing and auctions
 
07:13:05.830 --> 07:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
will be in 2024 and it was steel in the
 
07:13:07.670 --> 07:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
water a few years after that they're
 
07:13:09.670 --> 07:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
being built up and down the east coast
 
07:13:11.910 --> 07:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the initial project in the gulf of maine
 
07:13:14.390 --> 07:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be three to five gigawatts
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
07:13:18.230 --> 07:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
what four seabrooks
 
07:13:20.788 --> 07:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh and they anticipate 25 to 30
 
07:13:22.868 --> 07:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
gigawatts in the gulf of maine alone
 
07:13:25.110 --> 07:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's the saudi arabia wind
 
07:13:26.310 --> 07:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
we are going to be generating a lot of
 
07:13:28.788 --> 07:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
power we've got to on short we've got to
 
07:13:30.868 --> 07:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
build distribution if eversource we're
 
07:13:32.788 --> 07:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
here they will tell you that they are
 
07:13:34.708 --> 07:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
concerned and you know looking forward
 
07:13:36.788 --> 07:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
to a lot of costs to modernize the grid
 
07:13:39.110 --> 07:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's why an infrastructure bill
 
07:13:40.788 --> 07:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
and other bills in congress there's a
 
07:13:42.390 --> 07:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
lot of money being put into grid
 
07:13:42.400 --> 07:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
lot of money being put into grid
modernization

07:13:43.750 --> 07:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
07:13:46.390 --> 07:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
because you know we know this is
 
07:13:48.628 --> 07:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
something we're going to do
 
07:13:50.070 --> 07:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
i will say though a lot of people
 
07:13:52.150 --> 07:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and back to
 
07:13:53.510 --> 07:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts earlier
 
07:13:54.868 --> 07:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
question about well can we generate our
 
07:13:56.708 --> 07:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
own electricity at these sites and so on
 
07:13:58.628 --> 07:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
and so forth if you've got solar and
 
07:14:00.628 --> 07:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
you've got an inverter you can charge
 
07:14:03.190 --> 07:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
off your own your own your own solar and
 
07:14:04.468 --> 07:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of people electric
 
07:14:06.150 --> 07:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles are who are also going to be
 
07:14:07.990 --> 07:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
having heat pumps and inverters and so
 
07:14:09.670 --> 07:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
on and so forth will be doing those
 
07:14:12.948 --> 07:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
things complicated questions uh and and
 
07:14:14.948 --> 07:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
issues but i think this is why you're
 
07:14:17.190 --> 07:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
seeing so much conversation around new
 
07:14:19.830 --> 07:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
sources of renewable energy generation
 
07:14:23.510 --> 07:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:23.520 --> 07:14:24.628 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

07:14:24.628 --> 07:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:14:26.948 --> 07:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so again i guess i'm
 
07:14:26.958 --> 07:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so again i guess i'm
i

07:14:27.670 --> 07:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:14:29.590 --> 07:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
think i got the answer of not really but
 
07:14:32.868 --> 07:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not positive um yeah the the
 
07:14:34.788 --> 07:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure isn't actually the
 
07:14:36.628 --> 07:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
electrical grid infrastructure is
 
07:14:38.310 --> 07:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
nowhere in here we're talking about
 
07:14:41.030 --> 07:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
increasing capacity for electric or
 
07:14:42.788 --> 07:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
consumption of electricity but there's
 
07:14:45.270 --> 07:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
no crazy perceived
 
07:14:47.670 --> 07:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
cost in this build to what any in grid
 
07:14:49.350 --> 07:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
improvements might be necessary in order
 
07:14:50.390 --> 07:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve
 
07:14:51.430 --> 07:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
this goal
 
07:14:52.948 --> 07:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
we have no idea what that really looks
 
07:14:55.510 --> 07:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
like um thanks for your question um so
 
07:14:57.430 --> 07:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know part of it is uh you know
 
07:14:59.110 --> 07:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
eversource if they do the make ready
 
07:15:00.948 --> 07:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
work and bring in the power lines and
 
07:15:02.628 --> 07:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
then charging station itself has a
 
07:15:04.390 --> 07:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
certain cost and it's you know that's
 
07:15:06.150 --> 07:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
what gets paid for about other
 
07:15:08.150 --> 07:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
volkswagen fence or whatever
 
07:15:08.160 --> 07:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
volkswagen fence or whatever
um

07:15:09.110 --> 07:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:09.120 --> 07:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:15:09.910 --> 07:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:15:12.150 --> 07:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's what the utilities are doing in
 
07:15:15.270 --> 07:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
various states is the make ready work um
 
07:15:17.830 --> 07:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the scale of this
 
07:15:20.548 --> 07:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's a kind of a we have 1.6 million
 
07:15:21.910 --> 07:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
registered vehicles in the state of new
 
07:15:21.920 --> 07:15:22.868 align:start position:0%
registered vehicles in the state of new
hampshire

07:15:22.868 --> 07:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:15:24.230 --> 07:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
so then you know if we have a few
 
07:15:26.390 --> 07:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
thousand in a state fleet in and of
 
07:15:27.910 --> 07:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
itself and you know a lot of these
 
07:15:30.390 --> 07:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
garages already have heavy
 
07:15:33.110 --> 07:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
um duty electrical wiring come into them
 
07:15:35.190 --> 07:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
because they need that for for other
 
07:15:37.270 --> 07:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
purposes so um
 
07:15:39.270 --> 07:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think this in and of itself
 
07:15:41.350 --> 07:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
those questions are
 
07:15:44.150 --> 07:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
are relatively relatively minor because
 
07:15:46.708 --> 07:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of the grid enhancements
 
07:15:48.230 --> 07:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we're doing
 
07:15:49.670 --> 07:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
all over the state for all kinds of
 
07:15:49.680 --> 07:15:54.390 align:start position:0%
all over the state for all kinds of
reasons

07:15:54.390 --> 07:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:56.468 --> 07:15:56.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator and now kelly
 
07:15:59.110 --> 07:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
buchanan can tell us how she feels about
 
07:16:08.390 --> 07:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:11.030 --> 07:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair members of
 
07:16:12.868 --> 07:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record kelly
 
07:16:15.590 --> 07:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
buchanan with clean energy new hampshire
 
07:16:18.948 --> 07:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
um i will start with some questions that
 
07:16:20.310 --> 07:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
we've already heard today i know there
 
07:16:23.350 --> 07:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
was some concern about evs and role
 
07:16:26.230 --> 07:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
tolls or alternative to world tolls
 
07:16:27.750 --> 07:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator waters alluded to this but
 
07:16:29.750 --> 07:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative major does have a bill
 
07:16:31.830 --> 07:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
which is house bill 1040 that is
 
07:16:33.430 --> 07:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a study commission to
 
07:16:35.350 --> 07:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
examine exactly how we could address
 
07:16:37.030 --> 07:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
that and we at clean energy new
 
07:16:39.190 --> 07:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire do think it's a fairness issue
 
07:16:41.350 --> 07:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
that evs should contribute to the use of
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
the roads in some way
 
07:16:44.948 --> 07:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
the metric in the goal is to simply to
 
07:16:47.110 --> 07:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
get to a solution so that will help us
 
07:16:50.070 --> 07:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
find that and we expect that there will
 
07:16:51.990 --> 07:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
be some sort of proposal out of that if
 
07:16:53.590 --> 07:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
it passes so
 
07:16:55.670 --> 07:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's item number one item number two
 
07:16:57.910 --> 07:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
relates to grid modernization um and
 
07:16:59.590 --> 07:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of the preparation that the
 
07:17:01.750 --> 07:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
utilities have already gone underway at
 
07:17:03.270 --> 07:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission we've
 
07:17:04.708 --> 07:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
been involved in
 
07:17:07.270 --> 07:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
three separate dockets looking at ev
 
07:17:09.990 --> 07:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
rates in terms of rates that they
 
07:17:12.150 --> 07:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
receive when they purchase electricity
 
07:17:14.628 --> 07:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
and ev make ready work
 
07:17:15.750 --> 07:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
we received an order in one of those
 
07:17:18.788 --> 07:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
dockets we're still waiting on the
 
07:17:20.868 --> 07:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
docket that pertains to unitil as well
 
07:17:22.868 --> 07:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
as to eversource but the work is
 
07:17:24.708 --> 07:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
underway and i will mention that a lot
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
of those grid modernization
 
07:17:29.190 --> 07:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
improvements that would benefit our
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
capacity and our ability to serve an eb
 
07:17:33.990 --> 07:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
market would also benefit most rate
 
07:17:35.590 --> 07:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
payers because those investments
 
07:17:35.600 --> 07:17:36.868 align:start position:0%
payers because those investments
directly

07:17:36.868 --> 07:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
directly
 
07:17:36.878 --> 07:17:38.628 align:start position:0%
directly
reduce

07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
07:17:40.788 --> 07:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
inconveniences or
 
07:17:44.070 --> 07:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
threats to life or comfort from outages
 
07:17:44.080 --> 07:17:44.868 align:start position:0%
threats to life or comfort from outages
and

07:17:44.868 --> 07:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:17:46.468 --> 07:17:46.478 align:start position:0%
those sorts of events so grid
 
07:17:48.230 --> 07:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
modernization is multi-faceted and can
 
07:17:51.670 --> 07:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
be beneficial across an array of issues
 
07:17:53.670 --> 07:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
i will say that this bill in particular
 
07:17:55.350 --> 07:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 448
 
07:17:56.948 --> 07:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
is certainly one that we support and i
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
think it's really a cost saving
 
07:17:59.990 --> 07:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the state that one must
 
07:18:02.070 --> 07:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
recognize i'll throw out some numbers
 
07:18:04.070 --> 07:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
here and say that the eb cost of
 
07:18:06.310 --> 07:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
operation is about one dollar and
 
07:18:08.150 --> 07:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
seventy cents per gallon of gas
 
07:18:11.030 --> 07:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent ah when compared to a regular
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle which is about four dollars and
 
07:18:14.628 --> 07:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
twelve cents and those numbers were
 
07:18:16.948 --> 07:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
pulled from the department of
 
07:18:19.670 --> 07:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
energy at the federal level
 
07:18:21.510 --> 07:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we do not want to miss out on an
 
07:18:23.190 --> 07:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
important opportunity to save taxpayer
 
07:18:25.990 --> 07:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
money for the state and we can also
 
07:18:27.750 --> 07:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from this federal funding that
 
07:18:30.310 --> 07:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
is coming down to us to support the ev
 
07:18:31.990 --> 07:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure necessary for
 
07:18:33.270 --> 07:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
those vehicles
 
07:18:34.788 --> 07:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh so with that i know senator waters
 
07:18:36.150 --> 07:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
really did an excellent job this
 
07:18:37.590 --> 07:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon of covering the nitty gritty
 
07:18:39.830 --> 07:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
details of the bill so i will conclude
 
07:18:41.110 --> 07:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
and be happy to take any of your
 
07:18:41.120 --> 07:18:42.468 align:start position:0%
and be happy to take any of your
questions

07:18:42.468 --> 07:18:42.478 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:18:43.590 --> 07:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:18:48.230 --> 07:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:49.670 --> 07:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
07:18:51.670 --> 07:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
we thank you so you can get home and get
 
07:18:53.590 --> 07:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
your dinner
 
07:18:55.670 --> 07:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right no other pink cards were
 
07:18:58.788 --> 07:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
submitted so i assume nobody else wants
 
07:19:01.430 --> 07:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill
 
07:19:01.440 --> 07:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill
so

07:19:02.230 --> 07:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:19:04.230 --> 07:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing on
 
07:19:07.190 --> 07:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 448
 
07:19:09.510 --> 07:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we will take a
 
07:19:12.468 --> 07:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
five minute bio break and then we will
 
07:19:13.990 --> 07:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
commence to
 
07:19:14.000 --> 07:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
commence to
exec

07:19:15.910 --> 07:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
exec
 
07:19:15.920 --> 07:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
exec
six

07:19:17.030 --> 07:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
six
 
07:19:19.430 --> 07:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
i believe bills uh blue sheet on this
 
07:19:19.440 --> 07:19:20.948 align:start position:0%
i believe bills uh blue sheet on this
bill

07:19:20.948 --> 07:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:19:24.388 --> 07:19:24.398 align:start position:0%
representative white uh 44 in support
 
07:19:29.430 --> 07:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:31.910 --> 07:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:03.990 --> 07:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
it was like crispy
 
07:20:06.000 --> 07:21:00.628 align:start position:0%
it was like crispy
yeah

07:21:00.628 --> 07:21:00.638 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i would like to
 
07:36:01.510 --> 07:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
second that motion
 
07:36:03.430 --> 07:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
 
07:36:03.440 --> 07:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
pass

07:36:05.990 --> 07:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:08.708 --> 07:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 256 establishing a committee
 
07:36:10.150 --> 07:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
to study the feasibility of the
 
07:36:11.910 --> 07:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
replacing the site evaluation committee
 
07:36:13.270 --> 07:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
07:36:15.830 --> 07:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
long-term solution
 
07:36:18.868 --> 07:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
the short-term solution was
 
07:36:20.230 --> 07:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
07:36:20.240 --> 07:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
senate bill
429

07:36:23.030 --> 07:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
429
 
07:36:29.110 --> 07:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:31.590 --> 07:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
no this is the long term
 
07:36:33.430 --> 07:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the short-term solution
 
07:36:36.468 --> 07:36:36.478 align:start position:0%
was the bill we heard earlier today or
 
07:36:39.030 --> 07:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
was it earlier today
 
07:36:40.948 --> 07:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
yesterday yeah
 
07:36:43.270 --> 07:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
so this is the long-term solution which
 
07:36:47.750 --> 07:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:50.948 --> 07:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not to replace this
 
07:36:50.958 --> 07:36:51.750 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not to replace this
the

07:36:51.750 --> 07:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:36:53.350 --> 07:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee with a new
 
07:36:56.150 --> 07:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
structure i sent everybody yesterday
 
07:36:58.468 --> 07:36:58.478 align:start position:0%
an article by written by tom goetz that
 
07:36:59.830 --> 07:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
was published in the new hampshire
 
07:37:02.310 --> 07:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
business review that described his
 
07:37:05.030 --> 07:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
vision of what
 
07:37:07.110 --> 07:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
a revamped site evaluation committee
 
07:37:08.708 --> 07:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
might look like i hope everybody had a
 
07:37:11.590 --> 07:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
chance to take a peek at it
 
07:37:13.990 --> 07:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would probably be the
 
07:37:15.990 --> 07:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
the direction that the study committee
 
07:37:17.990 --> 07:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
would move in
 
07:37:19.830 --> 07:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's no guarantee
 
07:37:21.430 --> 07:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
that they would move that way but it
 
07:37:24.310 --> 07:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
would it would be a a road map for them
 
07:37:28.070 --> 07:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
to begin their deliberations
 
07:37:30.868 --> 07:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments
 
07:37:35.670 --> 07:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:38.388 --> 07:37:38.398 align:start position:0%
tom goetz is a
 
07:37:41.430 --> 07:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
20-year veteran of the
 
07:37:43.350 --> 07:37:43.360 align:start position:0%

attorney

07:37:52.628 --> 07:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
07:37:54.948 --> 07:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
and very knowledgeable about the state
 
07:37:54.958 --> 07:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
and very knowledgeable about the state
of

07:37:55.910 --> 07:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:37:58.788 --> 07:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh energy in new hampshire
 
07:38:00.788 --> 07:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
yeah he's represented projects so he's
 
07:38:02.468 --> 07:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
actually been on both sides been on the
 
07:38:03.590 --> 07:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
side evaluation committee and
 
07:38:05.030 --> 07:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
represented clients that were trying to
 
07:38:06.788 --> 07:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
get approval so
 
07:38:09.270 --> 07:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
he has a really vast uh
 
07:38:12.150 --> 07:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:14.708 --> 07:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
any additional comments about
 
07:38:17.590 --> 07:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
is representative callie pitts
 
07:38:19.830 --> 07:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
again the same comment i made was about
 
07:38:23.350 --> 07:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
the date of october 15th when the house
 
07:38:26.310 --> 07:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
can't officially we can't meet
 
07:38:29.350 --> 07:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
july and august house members can't meet
 
07:38:31.990 --> 07:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that's not giving very much time
 
07:38:34.468 --> 07:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
considering this has to go you know
 
07:38:36.150 --> 07:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the governor and get signed that's
 
07:38:36.160 --> 07:38:37.590 align:start position:0%
to the governor and get signed that's
all

07:38:37.590 --> 07:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
07:38:39.670 --> 07:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
it is a concern but
 
07:38:42.230 --> 07:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh since this is the second year of a
 
07:38:42.240 --> 07:38:43.190 align:start position:0%
uh since this is the second year of a
session

07:38:43.190 --> 07:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
07:38:44.788 --> 07:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
there's not much else you can do you
 
07:38:46.868 --> 07:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
can't create a study committee that
 
07:38:51.030 --> 07:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:53.030 --> 07:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
a commission can go longer but a study
 
07:38:55.270 --> 07:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee cannot
 
07:38:58.868 --> 07:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:00.868 --> 07:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'd ask the clerk to call
 
07:39:02.388 --> 07:39:02.398 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of ought to
 
07:39:05.990 --> 07:39:06.000 align:start position:0%

twenty to one is there any objection to
 
07:40:22.830 --> 07:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:26.070 --> 07:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
calendar right we'll put it on consent
 
07:40:27.830 --> 07:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
and let you take the heat if you pull it
 
07:40:27.840 --> 07:40:31.830 align:start position:0%
and let you take the heat if you pull it
off

07:40:31.830 --> 07:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:36.830 --> 07:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let's close the public hearing
 
07:40:42.468 --> 07:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 256.
 
07:40:44.708 --> 07:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:40:47.990 --> 07:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
we already did 440.
 
07:40:52.150 --> 07:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:54.468 --> 07:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
so next up would be
 
07:40:59.590 --> 07:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:59.600 --> 07:41:00.868 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:41:00.868 --> 07:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:41:03.990 --> 07:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
here i have an amendment
 
07:41:05.910 --> 07:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
did i pass that did you pass that out
 
07:41:08.070 --> 07:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
already i did
 
07:41:10.708 --> 07:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxenom has passed
 
07:41:12.548 --> 07:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
out an amendment
 
07:41:14.868 --> 07:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:41:16.868 --> 07:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make sure everybody has had
 
07:41:30.230 --> 07:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:33.190 --> 07:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
is this an amendment from
 
07:41:35.590 --> 07:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams no no this
 
07:41:38.070 --> 07:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
is from representative oxenom it's uh
 
07:41:41.830 --> 07:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
2022 1359h
 
07:41:43.510 --> 07:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we discussed at
 
07:41:45.190 --> 07:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
07:41:47.510 --> 07:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
which was the inconsistency between the
 
07:41:49.430 --> 07:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
changes where we're adding in the state
 
07:41:51.510 --> 07:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we already have a
 
07:41:54.468 --> 07:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
county as a
 
07:41:56.948 --> 07:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
viable political subdivision for this
 
07:41:58.868 --> 07:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
but we have this one sentence in here
 
07:42:00.788 --> 07:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
that says a municipal host shall be
 
07:42:03.670 --> 07:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
located in the same municipality as all
 
07:42:05.750 --> 07:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
group members which cannot possibly
 
07:42:07.270 --> 07:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
happen if it's the county and cannot
 
07:42:09.510 --> 07:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
possibly happen if it's the state
 
07:42:12.388 --> 07:42:12.398 align:start position:0%
and i passed out a map that shows the
 
07:42:15.030 --> 07:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
kind of harm or obstacle
 
07:42:17.110 --> 07:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
that this place is for many small towns
 
07:42:17.120 --> 07:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
that this place is for many small towns
where

07:42:17.990 --> 07:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
07:42:19.590 --> 07:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have one place where we could put a
 
07:42:20.788 --> 07:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
solar array
 
07:42:22.150 --> 07:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
but it's in
 
07:42:25.270 --> 07:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
in cornish and all of the group members
 
07:42:25.280 --> 07:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
in cornish and all of the group members
90

07:42:26.150 --> 07:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
90
 
07:42:26.160 --> 07:42:27.190 align:start position:0%
90
more

07:42:27.190 --> 07:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:42:29.670 --> 07:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
are in plainfield so that
 
07:42:31.910 --> 07:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
by removing this one single sentence we
 
07:42:34.708 --> 07:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
would make the statute consistent and we
 
07:42:36.708 --> 07:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
would make it able to apply to more than
 
07:42:39.030 --> 07:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
just one or two jurisdictions in the
 
07:42:39.040 --> 07:42:41.430 align:start position:0%
just one or two jurisdictions in the
state

07:42:41.430 --> 07:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:44.070 --> 07:42:44.080 align:start position:0%

07:42:54.388 --> 07:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
07:42:57.590 --> 07:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:00.310 --> 07:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to make a motion for uh
 
07:43:03.270 --> 07:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
07:43:06.468 --> 07:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
i recognize representative lewicki
 
07:43:07.830 --> 07:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
i second
 
07:43:10.230 --> 07:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
 
07:43:13.350 --> 07:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
judge senate bill 259 to be
 
07:43:15.750 --> 07:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
worthy of interim study
 
07:43:21.750 --> 07:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:24.708 --> 07:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
07:43:27.590 --> 07:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you chairman mr mr chairman
 
07:43:27.600 --> 07:43:28.708 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you chairman mr mr chairman
um

07:43:28.708 --> 07:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:30.708 --> 07:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
so on the main
 
07:43:34.070 --> 07:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill here we had language about the
 
07:43:36.788 --> 07:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
state housing authorities and quasi
 
07:43:39.110 --> 07:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
public entities as well as peace
 
07:43:40.708 --> 07:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
development authority
 
07:43:40.718 --> 07:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
development authority
uh

07:43:41.990 --> 07:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:43:43.670 --> 07:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
what causes
 
07:43:46.708 --> 07:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
i think a need for for uh interim study
 
07:43:49.510 --> 07:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
is because this this potentially greatly
 
07:43:49.520 --> 07:43:50.788 align:start position:0%
is because this this potentially greatly
expands

07:43:50.788 --> 07:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
expands
 
07:43:53.190 --> 07:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity for net metering we
 
07:43:56.388 --> 07:43:56.398 align:start position:0%
don't know how much how big in
 
07:43:58.708 --> 07:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
and because quasi-public entities are
 
07:43:58.718 --> 07:44:00.230 align:start position:0%
and because quasi-public entities are
considered

07:44:00.230 --> 07:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
considered
 
07:44:02.948 --> 07:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
this needs to be flushed out
 
07:44:09.910 --> 07:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:13.910 --> 07:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:15.910 --> 07:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'll ask the clerk
 
07:44:18.468 --> 07:44:18.478 align:start position:0%

energy
 
07:48:05.670 --> 07:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
07:48:08.548 --> 07:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
this is the exact text that they
 
07:48:11.030 --> 07:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh requested that we submit
 
07:48:13.430 --> 07:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i did was i added
 
07:48:16.628 --> 07:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
the sentence that starts on line 12
 
07:48:19.430 --> 07:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
and ends on line 13. the costs
 
07:48:21.910 --> 07:48:21.920 align:start position:0%

pursuant to this paragraph shall be
 
07:48:26.788 --> 07:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
recoverable so the original bill
 
07:48:27.910 --> 07:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
sought to
 
07:48:31.030 --> 07:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
change the payment period from yearly to
 
07:48:31.040 --> 07:48:32.310 align:start position:0%
change the payment period from yearly to
quarterly

07:48:32.310 --> 07:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
07:48:34.628 --> 07:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
for net metering credits
 
07:48:34.638 --> 07:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
for net metering credits
and

07:48:35.750 --> 07:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:48:37.430 --> 07:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
the department of energy identified a
 
07:48:38.948 --> 07:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
couple of technical issues with the
 
07:48:40.388 --> 07:48:40.398 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
07:48:42.468 --> 07:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
including the section of statute that it
 
07:48:46.868 --> 07:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
amended and so they suggested that
 
07:48:53.830 --> 07:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:55.750 --> 07:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
to structure this bill and so they asked
 
07:48:58.070 --> 07:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
us to amend it
 
07:48:59.430 --> 07:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
to structure it
 
07:49:01.590 --> 07:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
according to what they request what they
 
07:49:01.600 --> 07:49:03.750 align:start position:0%
according to what they request what they
needed

07:49:03.750 --> 07:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
needed
 
07:49:05.670 --> 07:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
07:49:10.468 --> 07:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:13.430 --> 07:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
my dinner yet i would i'm confused about
 
07:49:18.310 --> 07:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:20.788 --> 07:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
again looking at the at the
 
07:49:23.910 --> 07:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill and trying to look at this
 
07:49:25.190 --> 07:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
are still
 
07:49:28.150 --> 07:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
is the system of reimbursement still
 
07:49:31.110 --> 07:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
going to change to quarterly
 
07:49:32.868 --> 07:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
yes if it
 
07:49:32.878 --> 07:49:36.708 align:start position:0%
yes if it
exceeds

07:49:36.708 --> 07:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:39.270 --> 07:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars
 
07:49:41.590 --> 07:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
now at the end of the march billing
 
07:49:41.600 --> 07:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
now at the end of the march billing
period

07:49:43.030 --> 07:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
period
 
07:49:45.510 --> 07:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i again i guess i don't understand
 
07:49:47.430 --> 07:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the march billing
 
07:49:49.990 --> 07:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
period or on a quarterly basis an amount
 
07:49:53.270 --> 07:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
equal to the amount accrued
 
07:49:55.750 --> 07:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
and a balance so in essence you're
 
07:49:58.548 --> 07:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
07:50:01.030 --> 07:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
to a quarterly reimbursement
 
07:50:03.990 --> 07:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct may i ask
 
07:50:06.230 --> 07:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
why the amendment
 
07:50:09.190 --> 07:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
put in the dollar amounts which i don't
 
07:50:12.708 --> 07:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
see in this bill
 
07:50:14.948 --> 07:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
those were requested by senator waters
 
07:50:18.708 --> 07:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:21.110 --> 07:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
do we have any commentary from anybody
 
07:50:23.110 --> 07:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
else on these i mean i i guess did
 
07:50:25.110 --> 07:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
somebody throw a
 
07:50:27.350 --> 07:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
a dart at a dart but i don't understand
 
07:50:29.670 --> 07:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not customary to call on other
 
07:50:31.590 --> 07:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
people to speak during an exec session
 
07:50:33.270 --> 07:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
but i will ask
 
07:50:35.270 --> 07:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
griffin robarge from the department of
 
07:50:37.510 --> 07:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
energy if he could clear up any
 
07:50:43.590 --> 07:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:43.600 --> 07:50:44.548 align:start position:0%
 
thank

07:50:44.548 --> 07:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:50:44.558 --> 07:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
thank
sorry

07:50:45.510 --> 07:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:50:46.868 --> 07:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman votes members of the
 
07:50:49.110 --> 07:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee um i apologize i'd like to
 
07:50:50.948 --> 07:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
impose upon the committee i don't have a
 
07:50:52.468 --> 07:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment i just want to be
 
07:50:53.430 --> 07:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
sure i'm
 
07:50:54.788 --> 07:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
looking at what everybody's looking at
 
07:50:58.150 --> 07:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:09.510 --> 07:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:11.510 --> 07:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the bill and it doesn't
 
07:51:14.388 --> 07:51:14.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:17.910 --> 07:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:17.920 --> 07:51:20.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:51:20.948 --> 07:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:23.430 --> 07:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
sorry so uh chairman both members of the
 
07:51:25.510 --> 07:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee for your
 
07:51:28.628 --> 07:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh recollection uh the department noted
 
07:51:30.708 --> 07:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh a technical concern with the bill
 
07:51:32.150 --> 07:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing because the
 
07:51:34.468 --> 07:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
way the bill came over
 
07:51:37.110 --> 07:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the house from the senate
 
07:51:38.150 --> 07:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:51:41.110 --> 07:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
it amended a section of statute
 
07:51:43.590 --> 07:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
that would only apply to customer
 
07:51:46.230 --> 07:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
generators who are grandfathered into
 
07:51:47.750 --> 07:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
the net metering tariff that was
 
07:51:50.548 --> 07:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
outlined in june of 2017. it would only
 
07:51:52.388 --> 07:51:52.398 align:start position:0%
capture those customer generators who in
 
07:51:55.350 --> 07:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
existence pre that order as i think the
 
07:51:56.628 --> 07:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
committee might recall there was some
 
07:51:58.788 --> 07:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
testimony here about wanting it to apply
 
07:52:01.750 --> 07:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
to more modern customer generators those
 
07:52:07.270 --> 07:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
post this uh post 2017 order um in
 
07:52:08.948 --> 07:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
working with legal counsel in the
 
07:52:11.190 --> 07:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
department this language
 
07:52:13.990 --> 07:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
references that june 2017 order you see
 
07:52:15.910 --> 07:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
on line seven of the amendment order
 
07:52:15.920 --> 07:52:20.070 align:start position:0%
on line seven of the amendment order
26029

07:52:20.070 --> 07:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:21.910 --> 07:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so this would apply this would
 
07:52:21.920 --> 07:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
and so this would apply this would
codify

07:52:23.510 --> 07:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
codify
 
07:52:26.788 --> 07:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
elements of the puc order into statute
 
07:52:28.868 --> 07:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
now questions about where the numbers
 
07:52:30.070 --> 07:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
come from
 
07:52:33.670 --> 07:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
as part of the pucs order it was agreed
 
07:52:35.830 --> 07:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
upon that amongst all parties in the pc
 
07:52:37.110 --> 07:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
agreed that
 
07:52:37.120 --> 07:52:38.468 align:start position:0%
agreed that
utilities

07:52:38.468 --> 07:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
07:52:40.628 --> 07:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
would offer customer generators on a
 
07:52:42.388 --> 07:52:42.398 align:start position:0%
yearly basis
 
07:52:44.948 --> 07:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
a payout of any excess credit that they
 
07:52:47.030 --> 07:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
had if that amount is in excess of a
 
07:52:49.670 --> 07:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so that's where that 100
 
07:52:53.670 --> 07:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh amount comes from 25
 
07:52:54.788 --> 07:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
keeping with
 
07:52:57.110 --> 07:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
the logic of the pc order if it's 100
 
07:52:59.030 --> 07:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
per year and we're shifting to a
 
07:53:00.868 --> 07:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis
 
07:53:03.750 --> 07:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
25 every every three months so that is
 
07:53:06.788 --> 07:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
um where the language comes from we had
 
07:53:06.798 --> 07:53:07.830 align:start position:0%
um where the language comes from we had
only

07:53:07.830 --> 07:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
only
 
07:53:11.750 --> 07:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
issued the language from line 6 to 12
 
07:53:13.910 --> 07:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
to senator gray
 
07:53:17.190 --> 07:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
the phrase on lines 12 to 13 that read
 
07:53:18.948 --> 07:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
the cost reasonably occurred by utility
 
07:53:20.150 --> 07:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
pursuance's paragraph shall be
 
07:53:22.388 --> 07:53:22.398 align:start position:0%
recoverable was likely the result of
 
07:53:24.468 --> 07:53:24.478 align:start position:0%
working with utilities
 
07:53:26.830 --> 07:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
so any type of
 
07:53:30.150 --> 07:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
um billing software updates that they
 
07:53:32.468 --> 07:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
need to make in order to allow these
 
07:53:34.628 --> 07:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
payments to occur on a more on a more
 
07:53:37.030 --> 07:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
frequent basis or on a quarterly basis
 
07:53:41.990 --> 07:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:43.510 --> 07:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
07:53:47.110 --> 07:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:53.910 --> 07:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:55.430 --> 07:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i would just note that the
 
07:53:55.440 --> 07:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
and i would just note that the
department

07:53:57.350 --> 07:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
07:53:57.360 --> 07:53:58.230 align:start position:0%
department
again

07:53:58.230 --> 07:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
07:54:00.468 --> 07:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
remains neutral so
 
07:54:01.910 --> 07:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
of course
 
07:54:01.920 --> 07:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
of course
so

07:54:03.030 --> 07:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:54:04.708 --> 07:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
07:54:09.510 --> 07:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:12.150 --> 07:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion
 
07:54:14.628 --> 07:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
or does uh representative thomas need to
 
07:54:16.948 --> 07:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
make a comment
 
07:54:19.270 --> 07:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
oh there's a handout
 
07:54:19.280 --> 07:54:20.548 align:start position:0%
oh there's a handout
representative

07:54:20.548 --> 07:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:54:22.868 --> 07:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
you said you passed yes i did but i
 
07:54:25.350 --> 07:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually remembered the questions
 
07:54:27.030 --> 07:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
i asked your indulgence
 
07:54:27.040 --> 07:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
i asked your indulgence
um

07:54:27.990 --> 07:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:54:29.830 --> 07:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
you had a rather torturous turn of
 
07:54:31.430 --> 07:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
phrase there where you said it only
 
07:54:34.230 --> 07:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
captured the grandfathered price first
 
07:54:36.388 --> 07:54:36.398 align:start position:0%
for the one that was prior to the order
 
07:54:39.910 --> 07:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
in 2017. so could could you say that in
 
07:54:42.948 --> 07:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
in a in a direct way we often talk about
 
07:54:46.230 --> 07:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
net metering 1.0 and 2.0 yes are both of
 
07:54:49.430 --> 07:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
those covered by this change yes that
 
07:54:51.430 --> 07:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it that's
 
07:54:53.430 --> 07:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
what they added i just wanted to be
 
07:54:53.440 --> 07:54:54.388 align:start position:0%
what they added i just wanted to be
certain

07:54:54.388 --> 07:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
certain
 
07:54:56.150 --> 07:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
we just re there was a specific
 
07:54:57.830 --> 07:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
reference obviously to the puc order i
 
07:55:00.070 --> 07:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
think has been mentioned uh in the past
 
07:55:02.310 --> 07:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of you'll find a lot of
 
07:55:04.468 --> 07:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
net metering statute is outdated it's
 
07:55:06.150 --> 07:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
been superseded by puc order this
 
07:55:09.510 --> 07:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly referees references
 
07:55:13.430 --> 07:55:13.440 align:start position:0%

give us a short
 
08:00:44.468 --> 08:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
explanation of why i i understand why i
 
08:00:47.110 --> 08:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
think it should be an interim study but
 
08:00:52.388 --> 08:00:52.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:54.388 --> 08:00:54.398 align:start position:0%
is there a particular provision that
 
08:00:58.150 --> 08:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:59.670 --> 08:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
or something you're going to force me to
 
08:01:01.670 --> 08:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
dig out that yeah oh i'm i'm jerry bill
 
08:01:03.750 --> 08:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
aren't you i am
 
08:01:06.310 --> 08:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
08:01:07.830 --> 08:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the main things on this is
 
08:01:09.590 --> 08:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
the change from the
 
08:01:11.350 --> 08:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
commission to the department changes the
 
08:01:13.750 --> 08:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
methodology for awarding the awards and
 
08:01:15.590 --> 08:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
the commission you have in the judiciary
 
08:01:16.948 --> 08:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
process where everyone gets a chance to
 
08:01:18.548 --> 08:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
go forward present their case and so
 
08:01:20.548 --> 08:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
forth we're not exactly sure how it's
 
08:01:21.830 --> 08:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to work in the department yet so
 
08:01:23.590 --> 08:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's still being worked on so that's why
 
08:01:25.270 --> 08:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
we wanted to find out more about it
 
08:01:26.868 --> 08:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
before we made that change because it's
 
08:01:30.230 --> 08:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
a rather substantial change in process
 
08:01:33.750 --> 08:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um my if i might i've had a
 
08:01:35.510 --> 08:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
particular concern about this
 
08:01:37.270 --> 08:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
accumulated in excess of a million
 
08:01:39.350 --> 08:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollars we have no idea what the funding
 
08:01:41.430 --> 08:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
source is what's what's the normal
 
08:01:43.910 --> 08:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
amount how quickly it moves through so i
 
08:01:46.548 --> 08:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
i think interim study is is a very good
 
08:01:49.030 --> 08:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
beginning to to really look at
 
08:01:50.948 --> 08:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
other issues in this bill
 
08:01:54.230 --> 08:01:54.240 align:start position:0%

08:03:20.240 --> 08:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
committee report on interim study
yeah

08:03:21.510 --> 08:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
08:03:23.830 --> 08:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
you still have to have a report
 
08:03:27.510 --> 08:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
you still have to have a report yes
 
08:03:29.350 --> 08:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
very short one do
 
08:03:32.070 --> 08:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
i i might my question to the chair was
 
08:03:33.750 --> 08:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
did the members of the committee realize
 
08:03:36.230 --> 08:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
that interim study in the second session
 
08:03:39.030 --> 08:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
is a slow death
 
08:03:41.190 --> 08:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes we all realize that i believe
 
08:03:43.190 --> 08:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're only i explained it the other
 
08:03:45.190 --> 08:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
day there are only two outcomes for
 
08:03:47.510 --> 08:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
interim study in the second session the
 
08:03:50.868 --> 08:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
second year of a session one is
 
08:03:53.350 --> 08:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation or the
 
08:03:55.590 --> 08:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
other is not recommend for future
 
08:03:58.230 --> 08:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation those are the two choices so
 
08:03:59.830 --> 08:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
we will have a meeting on this in the
 
08:04:01.830 --> 08:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
fall and we'll choose one of those two
 
08:04:01.840 --> 08:04:02.868 align:start position:0%
fall and we'll choose one of those two
choices

08:04:02.868 --> 08:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
choices
 
08:04:05.510 --> 08:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
for it and any other bills we send into
 
08:04:07.590 --> 08:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
08:04:08.948 --> 08:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
all right so let's
 
08:04:12.628 --> 08:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
close the exact session on 264 and open
 
08:04:16.388 --> 08:04:16.398 align:start position:0%
an exact session on senate bill 268 and
 
08:04:22.230 --> 08:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:23.510 --> 08:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
08:04:25.430 --> 08:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
i move that we adopt
 
08:04:29.750 --> 08:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment 14 12 h2sb to 68 and i can
 
08:04:33.350 --> 08:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:34.868 --> 08:04:34.878 align:start position:0%
so the amount the
 
08:04:38.150 --> 08:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt amendment
 
08:04:38.160 --> 08:04:41.910 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt amendment
2022-1

08:04:41.910 --> 08:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:43.590 --> 08:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
and copies of that amendment are
 
08:04:46.948 --> 08:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
circulating around the table as we speak
 
08:04:49.590 --> 08:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i recognize representative lewicki
 
08:04:51.750 --> 08:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
while that is happening
 
08:04:53.190 --> 08:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh i second
 
08:04:54.948 --> 08:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
08:04:54.958 --> 08:04:56.310 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
adopt

08:04:56.310 --> 08:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
08:04:58.548 --> 08:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
amendment 20 0
 
08:05:00.350 --> 08:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
20 22
 
08:05:02.548 --> 08:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
1412 h
 
08:05:05.750 --> 08:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i recognize representative brezhney
 
08:05:08.708 --> 08:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative harrington uh yeah
 
08:05:10.310 --> 08:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think there might be a
 
08:05:12.070 --> 08:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
technical issue with this that we i
 
08:05:13.350 --> 08:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably should have caught in the
 
08:05:15.670 --> 08:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and i just noticed it now but
 
08:05:18.070 --> 08:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
in line 12 it says
 
08:05:19.670 --> 08:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about notwithstanding the
 
08:05:21.270 --> 08:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
provisions no state funds shall be
 
08:05:23.030 --> 08:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated expended for planning
 
08:05:24.868 --> 08:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
construction operation management of
 
08:05:27.430 --> 08:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
offshore wind or tidal resources the
 
08:05:29.670 --> 08:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
problem is the word planning we have the
 
08:05:31.510 --> 08:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
offshore wind commission which is
 
08:05:34.230 --> 08:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
actively involved in planning with that
 
08:05:38.150 --> 08:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's ongoing uh we're a member of this
 
08:05:40.788 --> 08:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know bone task force and so forth
 
08:05:42.708 --> 08:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
so i mean just by virtue of the fact
 
08:05:44.388 --> 08:05:44.398 align:start position:0%
that we have state employees attending
 
08:05:46.230 --> 08:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
these meetings i think that's money
 
08:05:48.230 --> 08:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
being spent on planning now i gave a
 
08:05:49.990 --> 08:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
copy to griffin he's gonna run it back
 
08:05:51.830 --> 08:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
to their council but maybe we could just
 
08:05:54.388 --> 08:05:54.398 align:start position:0%
put this on hold until next week
 
08:05:55.670 --> 08:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
i might hate to bring this up at the
 
08:05:56.788 --> 08:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
last minute but i don't know how to get
 
08:05:58.948 --> 08:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
around that otherwise
 
08:06:01.110 --> 08:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for pointing that
 
08:06:02.548 --> 08:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
out i'm going to let representative
 
08:06:04.788 --> 08:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
berezni speak to the amendment
 
08:06:06.310 --> 08:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh even though you've brought up a
 
08:06:08.548 --> 08:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
potential issue with it so
 
08:06:11.190 --> 08:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative brezhney is recognized
 
08:06:12.788 --> 08:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
okay i'll just point out that this
 
08:06:15.910 --> 08:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh this begins july 1st 2023 i
 
08:06:18.548 --> 08:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
don't know if that helps but um the the
 
08:06:20.948 --> 08:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
reason for the amendment is uh during
 
08:06:22.948 --> 08:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
the hearing yesterday
 
08:06:24.628 --> 08:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative pleasure brought up
 
08:06:24.638 --> 08:06:25.590 align:start position:0%
uh representative pleasure brought up
the

08:06:25.590 --> 08:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:06:28.310 --> 08:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
title power generation so that was added
 
08:06:30.948 --> 08:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
to this um bill and then
 
08:06:32.388 --> 08:06:32.398 align:start position:0%
the second thing that's added is a
 
08:06:34.230 --> 08:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition on using state funds for
 
08:06:34.240 --> 08:06:35.110 align:start position:0%
prohibition on using state funds for
wind

08:06:35.110 --> 08:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
wind
 
08:06:37.590 --> 08:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
and tidal power and
 
08:06:39.510 --> 08:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
the idea for that came from
 
08:06:42.548 --> 08:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
hp 1432 which was a prohibition on using
 
08:06:44.788 --> 08:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
state funds for the rail project which
 
08:06:47.830 --> 08:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
passed the house by a decent majority
 
08:06:49.270 --> 08:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is just to add
 
08:06:51.750 --> 08:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
guard rail this is an enabling bill
 
08:06:54.948 --> 08:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
and it should have some some kind of uh
 
08:06:57.590 --> 08:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
messaging of how far
 
08:07:02.150 --> 08:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking to go so that's that's it
 
08:07:04.070 --> 08:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
so representative brezhny where was the
 
08:07:07.430 --> 08:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
reference to july 1st of 2023 i think
 
08:07:11.110 --> 08:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:13.830 --> 08:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the first page ah okay yeah beginning
 
08:07:15.910 --> 08:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
on july 1st all right
 
08:07:15.920 --> 08:07:16.868 align:start position:0%
on july 1st all right
good

08:07:16.868 --> 08:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
good
 
08:07:18.388 --> 08:07:18.398 align:start position:0%
further discussion of this amendment
 
08:07:22.070 --> 08:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:26.070 --> 08:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i just i don't understand how either
 
08:07:28.150 --> 08:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
we have a department of wind right an
 
08:07:30.070 --> 08:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
office of wind um
 
08:07:32.548 --> 08:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
which is planning and
 
08:07:34.628 --> 08:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
there will be money expended if we are
 
08:07:36.070 --> 08:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to participate whether we're going
 
08:07:38.388 --> 08:07:38.398 align:start position:0%
to participate or not may still be
 
08:07:41.030 --> 08:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
objectively unknown but it seems like
 
08:07:43.830 --> 08:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of planning ongoing
 
08:07:46.708 --> 08:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
with which the state is participating in
 
08:07:49.750 --> 08:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
and to have a statutory cutoff date in
 
08:07:51.670 --> 08:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
here whereby those resources would no
 
08:07:53.590 --> 08:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
longer be able to participate seems to
 
08:07:53.600 --> 08:07:54.948 align:start position:0%
longer be able to participate seems to
be

08:07:54.948 --> 08:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
be
 
08:07:56.948 --> 08:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
counterproductive really to what we've
 
08:07:58.388 --> 08:07:58.398 align:start position:0%
been working on
 
08:08:01.110 --> 08:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
um so i just i don't
 
08:08:03.270 --> 08:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think having a three-page amendment
 
08:08:05.190 --> 08:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
come in at the last second to change a
 
08:08:08.310 --> 08:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill that was for something
 
08:08:08.320 --> 08:08:09.190 align:start position:0%
bill that was for something
um

08:08:09.190 --> 08:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:08:11.030 --> 08:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
it had a very specific purpose right
 
08:08:13.670 --> 08:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
which was to allow us to assert that
 
08:08:16.230 --> 08:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
consistency in how we're
 
08:08:19.270 --> 08:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh operating as a state in waters that
 
08:08:20.468 --> 08:08:20.478 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
08:08:22.150 --> 08:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
looked at for
 
08:08:24.868 --> 08:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
wind development so i think this bill
 
08:08:26.548 --> 08:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
takes it in another direction that would
 
08:08:29.590 --> 08:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
require a lot more discussion than we
 
08:08:31.190 --> 08:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
had in the hearing
 
08:08:33.990 --> 08:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and and i also think again
 
08:08:36.548 --> 08:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
the idea that no state monies could be
 
08:08:40.230 --> 08:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:42.310 --> 08:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's a non-starter that's how i would
 
08:08:45.030 --> 08:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:46.868 --> 08:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
08:08:46.878 --> 08:08:49.270 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
samsic

08:08:49.270 --> 08:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
samsic
 
08:08:51.590 --> 08:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes i'm kind of surprised about this
 
08:08:53.350 --> 08:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
amendment too
 
08:08:55.190 --> 08:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
not just because of the timing at the
 
08:08:57.510 --> 08:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
very last minute but because
 
08:08:59.750 --> 08:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of misconceptions
 
08:09:03.670 --> 08:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
here um maybe the idea is to somehow
 
08:09:07.510 --> 08:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
stop the whole process of offshore wind
 
08:09:10.868 --> 08:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
in which case i can say it will not stop
 
08:09:12.628 --> 08:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
the other states will go ahead without
 
08:09:12.638 --> 08:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
the other states will go ahead without
us

08:09:13.590 --> 08:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
08:09:15.830 --> 08:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
the whole idea is we need to be at the
 
08:09:17.510 --> 08:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
table to
 
08:09:19.990 --> 08:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that our interests as a state
 
08:09:22.230 --> 08:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
are recognized including the fishing
 
08:09:24.070 --> 08:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
industry and so forth
 
08:09:27.030 --> 08:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh and uh unless we're at the table uh
 
08:09:29.030 --> 08:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna have a say in this
 
08:09:31.270 --> 08:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy is currently
 
08:09:33.910 --> 08:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
looking for a consultant to hire
 
08:09:36.230 --> 08:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
for various projects associated with
 
08:09:37.910 --> 08:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
08:09:40.548 --> 08:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
that would bring that to a halt
 
08:09:40.558 --> 08:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
that would bring that to a halt
and

08:09:41.910 --> 08:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:09:44.948 --> 08:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
in addition the issue of tidal resource
 
08:09:47.030 --> 08:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
well i think it's a great idea there is
 
08:09:49.590 --> 08:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
no idea to do anything at this point
 
08:09:51.430 --> 08:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
nobody's willing no company is willing
 
08:09:53.590 --> 08:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
to do anything about it it's not
 
08:09:56.388 --> 08:09:56.398 align:start position:0%
necessarily a proven technology yet so
 
08:09:58.788 --> 08:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hypothetical
 
08:09:59.990 --> 08:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
even though i might think it's
 
08:10:02.388 --> 08:10:02.398 align:start position:0%
interesting we have considered that in
 
08:10:04.468 --> 08:10:04.478 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to seeing our ties go in and
 
08:10:07.190 --> 08:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
out all the time be nice
 
08:10:08.868 --> 08:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a lot of things in
 
08:10:11.670 --> 08:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
this bill that don't make a lot of sense
 
08:10:14.070 --> 08:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
the lack of funding for the legitimate
 
08:10:16.388 --> 08:10:16.398 align:start position:0%
offshore wind projects which will
 
08:10:18.788 --> 08:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
benefit new hampshire dramatically as we
 
08:10:21.270 --> 08:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
were talking just briefly in
 
08:10:23.910 --> 08:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
around electric car vehicles charging
 
08:10:26.548 --> 08:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
and the need for extra electricity
 
08:10:28.548 --> 08:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a huge energy
 
08:10:28.558 --> 08:10:29.670 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a huge energy
resource

08:10:29.670 --> 08:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
resource
 
08:10:31.750 --> 08:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it's going to go on without us or
 
08:10:33.910 --> 08:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
with us it doesn't matter what we say
 
08:10:36.230 --> 08:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
because we're a relatively small player
 
08:10:38.150 --> 08:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
but we're going to end up being
 
08:10:39.990 --> 08:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
at the back of the line playing defense
 
08:10:42.070 --> 08:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
and not having any say unless we get
 
08:10:44.548 --> 08:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
involved and become actively involved in
 
08:10:45.830 --> 08:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
it so
 
08:10:46.868 --> 08:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
i think
 
08:10:48.708 --> 08:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
without giving this a lot of thought or
 
08:10:50.548 --> 08:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
a hearing or something i think this is
 
08:10:52.388 --> 08:10:52.398 align:start position:0%
premature to come up with something like
 
08:10:54.388 --> 08:10:54.398 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
08:10:55.670 --> 08:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:10:58.310 --> 08:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
08:11:00.468 --> 08:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
08:11:03.670 --> 08:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um several things we
 
08:11:03.680 --> 08:11:04.628 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um several things we
heard

08:11:04.628 --> 08:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
heard
 
08:11:06.868 --> 08:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
repeatedly during the public hearing how
 
08:11:09.190 --> 08:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
important it was for new hampshire to
 
08:11:12.628 --> 08:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
protect its interests by establishing in
 
08:11:15.510 --> 08:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute that this consistency argument
 
08:11:17.430 --> 08:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we had to put these things in so
 
08:11:19.270 --> 08:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we could therefore
 
08:11:21.510 --> 08:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
be protective of the interests of the
 
08:11:24.070 --> 08:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire in secondarily
 
08:11:25.830 --> 08:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
numerically secondly maybe not
 
08:11:25.840 --> 08:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
numerically secondly maybe not
secondarily

08:11:27.110 --> 08:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
secondarily
 
08:11:29.270 --> 08:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are going to be enormous
 
08:11:31.670 --> 08:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
job opportunities and investment
 
08:11:34.150 --> 08:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities with this new industry
 
08:11:37.110 --> 08:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
coming in and we're we're foreclosing
 
08:11:38.788 --> 08:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
the door and saying new hampshire is not
 
08:11:40.868 --> 08:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
open for business we're not interested
 
08:11:43.350 --> 08:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
in what is probably the the biggest gold
 
08:11:46.868 --> 08:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
mine of at least the coming half century
 
08:11:46.878 --> 08:11:48.070 align:start position:0%
mine of at least the coming half century
and

08:11:48.070 --> 08:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:11:49.990 --> 08:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have this going to be the landing of
 
08:11:52.150 --> 08:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
power even if other states and the feds
 
08:11:54.548 --> 08:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
are are producing from wind they've got
 
08:11:56.708 --> 08:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
to bring that power on shore we've we've
 
08:11:59.190 --> 08:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
got that um seabrook
 
08:12:01.670 --> 08:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
facility that was never used as an
 
08:12:03.510 --> 08:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to bring it in that
 
08:12:05.430 --> 08:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
second that second um
 
08:12:07.670 --> 08:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
reactor site
 
08:12:10.788 --> 08:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
we are so posed to take advantage of
 
08:12:12.548 --> 08:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
this economic development opportunity
 
08:12:14.388 --> 08:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
and this just says no we're not
 
08:12:16.708 --> 08:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
interested in in business if it has a
 
08:12:19.910 --> 08:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
renewable tag
 
08:12:21.510 --> 08:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm amazed
 
08:12:23.830 --> 08:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the way i read
 
08:12:25.670 --> 08:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
this paragraph
 
08:12:29.590 --> 08:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
it basically says that
 
08:12:31.670 --> 08:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
any money expended for the planning
 
08:12:33.510 --> 08:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
construction operation or management of
 
08:12:35.430 --> 08:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
08:12:37.670 --> 08:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
should be private money
 
08:12:40.070 --> 08:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
not public money
 
08:12:42.868 --> 08:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
what what this paragraph says to me is
 
08:12:45.750 --> 08:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the private sector sector should be
 
08:12:48.868 --> 08:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
investing in this technology
 
08:12:52.868 --> 08:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
the private sector is frequently
 
08:12:54.628 --> 08:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
or maybe frequently isn't the best word
 
08:12:56.708 --> 08:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
maybe it's always
 
08:12:59.350 --> 08:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
better at
 
08:13:02.948 --> 08:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
accomplishing this kind of of work than
 
08:13:05.270 --> 08:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the public sector the public sector
 
08:13:06.788 --> 08:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
tends to
 
08:13:08.628 --> 08:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
be less efficient
 
08:13:11.110 --> 08:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
at accomplishing this kind of work so
 
08:13:12.070 --> 08:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
what this
 
08:13:14.230 --> 08:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph says to me is we want the
 
08:13:17.510 --> 08:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
private sector to take over this
 
08:13:20.628 --> 08:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
this uh the build-out of this
 
08:13:23.910 --> 08:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
win these wind energy resources without
 
08:13:23.920 --> 08:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
win these wind energy resources without
encumbering

08:13:25.350 --> 08:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
encumbering
 
08:13:27.750 --> 08:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
public money
 
08:13:30.468 --> 08:13:30.478 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
08:13:31.990 --> 08:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair votes i would agree
 
08:13:33.430 --> 08:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
with you i would like the private sector
 
08:13:35.830 --> 08:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
to become involved with this and do the
 
08:13:37.590 --> 08:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
actual construction and building that's
 
08:13:39.190 --> 08:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriate role
 
08:13:40.628 --> 08:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
but the appropriate role for the private
 
08:13:42.628 --> 08:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
sector is not to declare a 200 mile
 
08:13:44.230 --> 08:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
contingency and that's what the original
 
08:13:45.590 --> 08:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill did
 
08:13:48.708 --> 08:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
i notice the date on this is uh july 1st
 
08:13:48.718 --> 08:13:50.708 align:start position:0%
i notice the date on this is uh july 1st
2023

08:13:50.708 --> 08:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
2023
 
08:13:52.388 --> 08:13:52.398 align:start position:0%
why can't this not be introduced as a
 
08:13:55.270 --> 08:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
separate bill independent of this bill
 
08:13:57.750 --> 08:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can get this states rights
 
08:13:59.430 --> 08:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill passed
 
08:14:01.430 --> 08:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and then we can work on the logistics of
 
08:14:05.510 --> 08:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:07.270 --> 08:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh further comments representative
 
08:14:10.230 --> 08:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:10.240 --> 08:14:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
again

08:14:11.270 --> 08:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
08:14:12.948 --> 08:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think my brain is functioning
 
08:14:17.750 --> 08:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
the way it should i'm looking at the the
 
08:14:20.788 --> 08:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
section three that was in question
 
08:14:20.798 --> 08:14:22.468 align:start position:0%
section three that was in question
and

08:14:22.468 --> 08:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:14:25.990 --> 08:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:30.070 --> 08:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
the same section that i see in
 
08:14:32.150 --> 08:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill
 
08:14:32.160 --> 08:14:33.190 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill
10

08:14:33.190 --> 08:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
10
 
08:14:35.430 --> 08:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the of the monies the crew
 
08:14:38.468 --> 08:14:38.478 align:start position:0%
collected for mitigation etc etc are
 
08:14:40.868 --> 08:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
going to go to the des
 
08:14:44.070 --> 08:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
so where is this bill
 
08:14:47.350 --> 08:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely cutting out this amendment
 
08:14:50.548 --> 08:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely cutting out use of private
 
08:14:50.558 --> 08:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
absolutely cutting out use of private
funds

08:14:51.430 --> 08:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
08:14:56.548 --> 08:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
can you tell me which paragraph you were
 
08:15:00.230 --> 08:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:02.708 --> 08:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
i was referring to the paragraph on
 
08:15:08.150 --> 08:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:11.190 --> 08:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
on page one and that apparently there
 
08:15:13.830 --> 08:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
was a quest there's a question about
 
08:15:15.830 --> 08:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be changed i do
 
08:15:15.840 --> 08:15:17.670 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be changed i do
believe

08:15:17.670 --> 08:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
08:15:20.308 --> 08:15:20.318 align:start position:0%
there was a that that was that paragraph
 
08:15:21.830 --> 08:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
in question
 
08:15:23.430 --> 08:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
i have it circled that it was in
 
08:15:25.510 --> 08:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
question and there was a technical
 
08:15:27.750 --> 08:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
change on it or
 
08:15:29.750 --> 08:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think paragraph three is a new
 
08:15:32.150 --> 08:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph isn't it is that not
 
08:15:34.868 --> 08:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
he brought up planning as an issue that
 
08:15:37.110 --> 08:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
we are involved in planning
 
08:15:39.750 --> 08:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
that no state fund should be appropriate
 
08:15:42.150 --> 08:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
as for planning construction operation
 
08:15:45.190 --> 08:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
or management of the offshore winning so
 
08:15:45.200 --> 08:15:46.628 align:start position:0%
or management of the offshore winning so
is

08:15:46.628 --> 08:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:15:49.510 --> 08:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
on this particular part
 
08:15:51.990 --> 08:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
was con you're gonna will you leave
 
08:15:54.948 --> 08:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:57.350 --> 08:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
take out construction operation or
 
08:15:57.360 --> 08:15:59.510 align:start position:0%

08:16:34.468 --> 08:16:34.478 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
08:16:36.628 --> 08:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
this bill now the amendment like i say i
 
08:16:38.628 --> 08:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
apologize for not catching this earlier
 
08:16:40.150 --> 08:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
but the amendment's in conflict to the
 
08:16:42.548 --> 08:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
bill we just passed and it's in fact in
 
08:16:44.788 --> 08:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
conflict of what we're we're pursuing so
 
08:16:47.350 --> 08:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're taking out just the word planning
 
08:16:49.110 --> 08:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
well we we can't do we have to do
 
08:16:50.868 --> 08:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
another amendment now in order to do
 
08:16:53.510 --> 08:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
that but that's what you would do is yes
 
08:16:55.110 --> 08:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's the word i have the problem
 
08:16:59.430 --> 08:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:01.030 --> 08:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with those words but i
 
08:17:03.830 --> 08:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
do everyone was planning
 
08:17:06.388 --> 08:17:06.398 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
08:17:09.510 --> 08:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes uh um first
 
08:17:13.110 --> 08:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
off this amendment is still designed to
 
08:17:16.150 --> 08:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
allow us to claim consistency that's
 
08:17:18.070 --> 08:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's a primary goal
 
08:17:21.670 --> 08:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
number one number number two
 
08:17:23.830 --> 08:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
that is all the language that wasn't
 
08:17:25.990 --> 08:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
changed it's on the second page it says
 
08:17:29.030 --> 08:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
to develop a gld and identified partners
 
08:17:31.030 --> 08:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah at the very bottom
 
08:17:33.190 --> 08:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
of page two nothing is nothing has
 
08:17:35.830 --> 08:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
changed there that's and that is the one
 
08:17:38.388 --> 08:17:38.398 align:start position:0%
of the primary functions of this bill
 
08:17:38.398 --> 08:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
of the primary functions of this bill
the

08:17:39.270 --> 08:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:17:43.110 --> 08:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
the second point was to make
 
08:17:44.948 --> 08:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire keep new hampshire
 
08:17:48.628 --> 08:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
involved in both wind and title okay if
 
08:17:52.070 --> 08:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
we don't do anything on title fine but
 
08:17:54.150 --> 08:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
be involved
 
08:17:57.270 --> 08:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
as a as appropriate the third point is
 
08:17:59.350 --> 08:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
is where we have we where we have this
 
08:17:59.360 --> 08:18:00.548 align:start position:0%
is where we have we where we have this
difficulty

08:18:00.548 --> 08:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
08:18:03.030 --> 08:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
and as as chairman votes has pointed out
 
08:18:06.388 --> 08:18:06.398 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the paragraph starting on
 
08:18:07.750 --> 08:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
08:18:12.150 --> 08:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
line 11 was to to fundamentally say we
 
08:18:14.788 --> 08:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
should not be as new hampshire involved
 
08:18:18.388 --> 08:18:18.398 align:start position:0%
in the ab the dedication of new
 
08:18:20.628 --> 08:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire funds for the ownership
 
08:18:23.670 --> 08:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
construction operation of any windmills
 
08:18:25.830 --> 08:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
that are going out there if the state of
 
08:18:28.468 --> 08:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
massachusetts wants to put their money
 
08:18:31.030 --> 08:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
into it or maine that's fine but it
 
08:18:32.868 --> 08:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
should be private money that's doing
 
08:18:34.868 --> 08:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
this task as far as new hampshire is
 
08:18:37.430 --> 08:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that's the that's the that's
 
08:18:40.388 --> 08:18:40.398 align:start position:0%
the three purposes of this amendment
 
08:18:42.388 --> 08:18:42.398 align:start position:0%
federal as well you weren't recognized
 
08:18:45.430 --> 08:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative please uh so raise your
 
08:18:47.750 --> 08:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
hand and i recognize ask to be
 
08:18:50.230 --> 08:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
recognized before you speak
 
08:18:53.190 --> 08:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think bottom line this bill this
 
08:18:55.350 --> 08:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendment still addresses that primary
 
08:18:57.350 --> 08:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of consistency
 
08:18:58.548 --> 08:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
it adds
 
08:19:00.308 --> 08:19:00.318 align:start position:0%
our involvement and potential title
 
08:19:00.318 --> 08:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
our involvement and potential title
power

08:19:01.350 --> 08:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
power
 
08:19:03.590 --> 08:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything wrong with that we
 
08:19:05.910 --> 08:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
do have the issue of that
 
08:19:07.750 --> 08:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative harrington's brought up
 
08:19:10.150 --> 08:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
we stuck the word planning in here and
 
08:19:13.430 --> 08:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:16.070 --> 08:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
in that case i think that
 
08:19:19.030 --> 08:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment probably isn't passable
 
08:19:20.628 --> 08:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
08:19:23.190 --> 08:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to move this off to
 
08:19:25.030 --> 08:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
april 19th
 
08:19:27.990 --> 08:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to pass this bill today
 
08:19:28.000 --> 08:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like to pass this bill today

08:19:29.750 --> 08:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:19:32.388 --> 08:19:32.398 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
08:19:32.398 --> 08:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
is there any
appetite

08:19:33.830 --> 08:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
appetite
 
08:19:36.628 --> 08:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
amongst the committee members for not
 
08:19:38.788 --> 08:19:38.798 align:start position:0%

study is that yesterday
 
08:23:47.510 --> 08:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of questions and concerns
 
08:23:49.510 --> 08:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
from both sides of the aisle
 
08:23:51.110 --> 08:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
that included
 
08:23:53.350 --> 08:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
amongst other things the fact that the
 
08:23:54.628 --> 08:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
commission was
 
08:23:56.070 --> 08:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the commission was very
 
08:23:56.080 --> 08:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the commission was very
unbalanced

08:23:57.830 --> 08:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
unbalanced
 
08:23:59.350 --> 08:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
08:24:01.110 --> 08:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
a big concern
 
08:24:02.868 --> 08:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
over reducing the contractor
 
08:24:02.878 --> 08:24:04.468 align:start position:0%
over reducing the contractor
pre-qualifications

08:24:04.468 --> 08:24:04.478 align:start position:0%
pre-qualifications
 
08:24:06.628 --> 08:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
and what that meant
 
08:24:08.468 --> 08:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
and also there was a
 
08:24:10.230 --> 08:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
feeling that there was a need to better
 
08:24:10.240 --> 08:24:11.670 align:start position:0%
feeling that there was a need to better
understand

08:24:11.670 --> 08:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand
 
08:24:14.070 --> 08:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
what the impact of the fiscal
 
08:24:16.948 --> 08:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
participation expansion to new hampshire
 
08:24:19.830 --> 08:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
users of propane and oil would be
 
08:24:22.070 --> 08:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
given the already super high energy
 
08:24:24.388 --> 08:24:24.398 align:start position:0%
prices that our citizens are currently
 
08:24:24.398 --> 08:24:28.230 align:start position:0%
prices that our citizens are currently
paying
