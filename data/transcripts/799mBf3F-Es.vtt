00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,500
THE PURPOSE OF THIS GATHERING, COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE ON HB 1585.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:42,500
EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE TO BE ON THIS COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE IS HERE.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
AND SO LET'S PROCEED.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
REPRESENTATIVE WEBB, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
JUST LOOKING.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,000
OR REPRESENTATIVE MERCHANT, EITHER ONE.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Well, I um representative webby you look like you have something to say oh just looking or representative merchant either one well i i i will just say that i've had a lot of conversations with a number of people in the last couple of days and um about the house version and the senate version and they all said that they liked the senate version of the definition under Roman three on page two of the side by side because it was more restrictive than the House version.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:47,000
And I kept saying, but the Senate version removed the house, the restrictions in the House version.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Roman numeral three, it says a calma is authorized to administer non-injectable medication the earlier side-by-side that i was given oh okay sorry there's more over here I thought there was one in every place.

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Everybody got one?

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Probably one.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
We just boxed that up the wrong place.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Okay.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,000
So let me start over again now that you've got something in front of you.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:50,500
And if you turn to page two, the concern that I had with the Senate version, which people were calling me up and saying they liked very much, or at least they liked better than the House version, some of them don't like it a lot, is that it was more restrictive and simply removed the non-injectables.

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:59,500
The side-by-side that I was provided with up until this version did not have the word non-injectable there.

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,000
It had been adopted by the Senate.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Somehow it had not made it into one of the many versions on the website.

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:20,500
And so now that with the word non-injectable there, it is at least clear to me what we're talking about.

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:36,000
And I'm not speaking for anybody else on the House side, just myself, but I would be willing to go along with that if that gets this piece of legislation through.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,500
We can start where we start, see how it works, start with what people are comfortable with, and then see how it evolves into practice.

34
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
So, Mr.

35
00:03:50,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Chairman, unless you have any objections to that, could we tentatively agree that we would use the Senate version of that that piece of the non-objectable yeah I don't object to that okay so that means that we are in exactly the same place except that the issue is the addition of the appropriation for the nurses.

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And it's a little difficult, equivocal being here on the House side because we passed it once and didn't pass it once.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:42,500
So I, speaking for myself, I'd love to see that go through, but I don't know how other people on the committee of conference feel.

38
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,000
As a policy matter, we passed it.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Senator Perle?

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,500
I think the Senate is happy with the bill as we presented it.

41
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,000
We'd be happy to have you come on board.

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, the funding that we put into this program, it's an existing program, as you all know.

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think it's an important one.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We have a real shortage of qualified medical personnel, especially nurses and the likes that this slurper fund would cover.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I think it's real important to leave it there.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I know Senator Gannon is very passionate about having this remain in the bill.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,500
And at this point, I think we're here to advocate for to keep that position.

48
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Talking about the appropriation of $300,000?

49
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Yes.

50
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Any other reaction?

51
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Representative Merchant.

52
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Thank you, Mr.

53
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Chair.

54
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,000
I also support the position did pass on the policy side.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,500
It did pass out of the Finance Committee 15 to 10.

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,000
It didn't pass the House full committee.

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It went down 180.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,500
It was 178 to 182.

59
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Very close.

60
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:27,000
And I went back because one of the comments we had on the floor was the amount of money that a particular nurse could receive.

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And to get clarification about this, if you look at the actual statute, look at the rules underneath it, there are a couple of things to bring to people's attention.

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One is a nurse can only get up to $30,000 over three years, possibly $40,000 over five years.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Number two, it has to be an underserved area of the state.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Three, if they don't fulfill their obligations, not only do they have to pay back the amount of money that they were given, they have to pay it back with a penalty of 20%.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To me, those are real reasons to support the bill because we're ensuring, A, is going to go into primary care, which is what nurses are focused on.

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Two, if they don't fulfill their obligation, there's a stiff penalty and it's very clear in there of what that will be.

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:57,500
So I don't have an issue with funding more to target it to nurses in general because I think we need nurses, particularly in underserved areas of our state, and this is a way to get there.

68
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
We'll solve the whole nursing problem.

69
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm not going to be looking at it that way, but at least it starts identifying nurses and trying to attract more nurses to the undisturbed area.

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:26,500
looking at it that way, but at least it starts identifying nurses and trying to attract more nurses to the underserving areas of our state.

71
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, Representative, you've taken my argument for why you guys should support it, so I'll concur with all the things you just said.

72
00:08:38,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, we're currently funding $700,000 plus into this annually, and I think additional funds are necessary in order to help alleviate the problem that we have within this industry representative nagel thanks mr chairman whatever um chairman i i just wanted to verify that all the guardrails that you just said are already in existence and that's already there because that was my only objective yeah This is this is the current existing program and that's why i began and shifted and agreed to go to he had originally uh wanted to put in a whole separate program and uh in consulting with hhs he did a lot of work with it and realized that this program was already there and was kind of really doing what he wanted to so he just looked for an increase in funding i think that if we let the house know that that's the fact i think we can get it i like with this bill a lot both of them i mean there's obviously and and you you folks and dave and probably all of us do i represent have nagel know that the appropriation is going to be a concern especially on the republican side in the house um And I'm not sure if this is going to be a poison pill for it.

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's my concern.

74
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Yeah, that's a good point.

75
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
But we're always looking for...

76
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,500
And again, both of you have been in the House and on the Republican caucus.

77
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:53,000
We're always looking for good ways to spend money, you know, the right ways to spend money.

78
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Well, we certainly find a lot just try to get it.

79
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Would there be some appetite on the Senate side to reduce the $300,000 to a smaller number?

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think the $300 is a reasonable ask, considering what the program already does.

81
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:26,500
And I'm not sure that $100,000 or $300,000 would be any more amenable to the folks that would oppose this that the chair is discussing.

82
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,500
So I don't know that that would be a notable change enough to make a difference.

83
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Senator Carson.

84
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Thank you, Mr.

85
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Chairman.

86
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I think this is a worthwhile investment, and that's what we're doing.

87
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:59,500
We're making an investment not only into the health care system, but we're making an investment into people who need that health care in underserved areas.

88
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:14,000
We know we have these spots all around the state, and we really need to do everything we can to make sure that they have access to quality care.

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And that means sometimes we have to put some money into it, and I think this is a worthwhile cause.

90
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you.

91
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Representative Nagel.

92
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I just want to let you know, I mean, I've been in medicine now for over 40 years, and I had indirect involvement with the National Health Service Corps, which is exactly what you're describing here.

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,500
And I think that was a wildly successful program.

94
00:12:50,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And what was even neater about it was a lot of the people that were paying back student loans to do it ended up staying where they went.

95
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
And that's what you want.

96
00:13:07,000 --> 00:14:57,500
so I mean ideally this isn't going to just a short term four-year whatever that they're going to stay there forever and be part of those communities and i think this is what we really need to do and i said that in committee if i remember right so well just to be perfectly clear this isn't a loan repayment this is kind of a contractual agreement that they have to stay and serve out a term and that's the way the nhsc work too yeah senator purpose did you have something you wanted to say i'm sorry uh no i i agree with everything that's been said i think this is a very important program i appreciate the support on the policy amendment we made which was requested by the board of nursing and by representative merchant on the floor which may have been why non-injectable didn't make it into the first version but um no i think this is great and and i tend to agree that for folks that have concern about the appropriation i don't think lowering it from 300 000 is going to alleviate that so would love to win your support for the senate version i just have one more comment because the way this was presented on the House floor was the number 50,000.

97
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
And we're not talking 50,000 here.

98
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And I think it was a little, we need to be more persuasive in our case, if I'm not mistaken.

99
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Anyone else?

100
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:22,000
As we all know, the vote on the floor on June 13th is going to be up or down.

101
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,500
There's no amending or anything like that.

102
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,000
And I'm just, I agree with the importance of this issue.

103
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm just looking at feasibility and getting something passed.

104
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,500
And I'd rather have something passed than nothing.

105
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
And am I predicting what's going to happen?

106
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Can I predict what's going to happen?

107
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, but I can talk about potential pitfalls, and that's what I'm talking about.

108
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr.

109
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Chair?

110
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

111
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:13,500
Sometimes we get in places we have to make difficult decisions, and the option from our perspective is it needs to be the package as it is.

112
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:21,500
And you're willing to give up the whole thing if you can't get everything you want.

113
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I think the bill as it is is a good piece of legislation and should gain the support of the members of the House.

114
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Should.

115
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Should.

116
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Operative word.

117
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
That's why I worried.

118
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Representative Merchant, I'm sorry.

119
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Thank you, Mr.

120
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Chair.

121
00:16:47,500 --> 00:17:12,500
And that's kind of what I'm trying to get to is that if it goes from $300,000 to $250,000, I'm just trying to go back to our colleagues on the House side and saying there was some concession done by the Senate side recognizing we're in a fiscal non-budgetary year.

122
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:27,000
That's all I'm trying to do is how to be sure, like the Chair is talking about, we have something we can try to sell internally to the House.

123
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's really where I'm coming from.

124
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
I support the program 100%.

125
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm just trying to figure out what's the highest probability to get something through the House.

126
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Again, I'm not against the merits of the program.

127
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not arguing that.

128
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm arguing about, you know, numbers.

129
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Do the House conferees need to have a conference?

130
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Because, I mean, we just, I think all the information's out here.

131
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,000
We just need to make a decision.

132
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So perhaps if we could go into the office for a moment.

133
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,500
Anything else the Senate wants to say for us?

134
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Only thing I will tell you is at 10.30, we have another one to be at.

135
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,000
So we've been a very few minutes.

136
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't think that's going to take one.

137
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Five minutes.

138
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Excuse us.

139
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm the chair.

140
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Thanks.

141
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Five and a half.

142
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,500
That's why i have five minutes we don't have a five Thank you.

143
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Thank you.

144
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Thank you.

145
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Thank you.

146
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Thank you, Mr.

147
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Chair, I do.

148
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I would like to...

149
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Okay, we'll call the meeting back in order.

150
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,500
And Representative Merchant, did you want to make a comment?

151
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Thank you, Mr.

152
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Chair, I do.

153
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I would like to propose to the Senate that we reduce it from $300,000 to $250,000.

154
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:37,000
I think it has a better opportunity to get through the House at $250,000 to, at that point in time, show to our colleagues in the House that we had some negotiations with the Senate.

155
00:19:37,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's kind of what I would propose to the senate reaction from senator pearl senator spoker perkins spoker or senator carson i guess my feeling is the same as it was before representative i respect your offer but i don't see that that's going to move the people that aren't going to vote for it if you um 250 000 300 000, 300,000, it's more about the fact you're spending money, not about the dollar value.

156
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,500
In my many years of being in the House, that's what I learned.

157
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
But I don't know.

158
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
You guys want to move or?

159
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:34,500
No, I think we're going to sit on 300,000 and stay with the bill as presented.

160
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Any other comments from the House side?

161
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Representative Weber.

162
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If the Senate is willing to tank this whole bill over $50,000, I don't see that we have any chance other than...

163
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,500
Senator Perkins spoke very well.

164
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Well, I just...

165
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Willing to say something?

166
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:10,500
No, I mean, I can see the value, right, of being able to go to the representatives and just say the Senate conceded this small point.

167
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I don't necessarily want to change the appropriation.

168
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I mean, I feel like this is a good package, and there's a lot of things we've spent money on.

169
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:58,000
so i can see both sides um but i also know you guys have to be our ambassadors you know to win this vote so i'll just say you know i i might be open to it but my colleagues have to agree the question is are you or aren't you i mean i'm not sure that it's fair to say that we're tanking at over 50,000.

170
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I mean, we could say the same the other way.

171
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, the principle of the bill is we're agreeing that this is an important, important place to invest some money.

172
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,500
I mean, I'm not going to quibble over $50,000.

173
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't I don't think that helps your argument in the House, at least personally.

174
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,500
I've spent an awful lot of years there myself, and there's a contingent of the House that won't vote for this because it has money.

175
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,500
And $250,000 or $300,000 isn't going to map.

176
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
I get that.

177
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:54,000
And the question is, are you willing to lose the other part of the bill over this part of the bill?

178
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
It sounds to me like you are.

179
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I have no idea whether we can get this through the House at 250 or at 300, because this is the part that the House didn't agree with.

180
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:22,500
And, you know, the House position that I'm supposed to be defending on that part of the bill is take it out.

181
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm for myself, I want to keep the other part of the bill is take it out.

182
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm, for myself, I want to keep the other part of the bill alive.

183
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I personally would also like to keep this part of the bill alive, but that's not the job I was sent here to do.

184
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,500
If you're going to walk away from the whole thing over not having the 300, then we have to roll the dice in the house.

185
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I don't see that we've got a choice on that.

186
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,000
Representative Merchant, you had your hand up.

187
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Thank you, Mr.

188
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Chair.

189
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I concur.

190
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think there are going to be some in the house that regardless if it's $10 or 300,000 are going to oppose it no matter what.

191
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,500
But I think if we can pull four or five, six votes, we only lost by three last time.

192
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:54,500
So we're not asking for a lot, but I'm trying to find a way to increase the probability to get to enough votes in the House to make it survive.

193
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,500
That's kind of what I'm trying to get to, Senator.

194
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,000
So Representative Nagel had made some points about now he has a better understanding of the bill.

195
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So it isn't really about 300,000 or 250,000.

196
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,500
It's more about understanding of the bill.

197
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:31,000
I suspect there's many more in the House that once they have a proper explanation from you folks, that their opinion will say, you know what, the bill is worth keeping.

198
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:50,500
You haven't watched the House's voting pattern since you left have you we can hear you we're watching believe me we're watching how things work um it's just that again and i'm supporting um senator pearl's position it doesn't.

199
00:25:50,500 --> 00:26:03,000
There are going to be people who are going to vote no because it's spending one dime and they don't want to spend any money.

200
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It doesn't matter.

201
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,500
So, yeah, I mean, I can't see reducing it.

202
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
It doesn't matter.

203
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,000
They're just not going to support it.

204
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,500
But this is good policy.

205
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,500
And I think you can sell this to the House members as good policy.

206
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
You have a better understanding.

207
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I think it should have a chance.

208
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It should.

209
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,500
But I don't want to see it tank either.

210
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,000
But what good does it do to reduce it?

211
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,500
They're not going to support it anyway.

212
00:26:45,500 --> 00:27:07,500
So I think your better position to go back to your House members and say, listen, we learned and we understand now that their proper guardrails are in place, the money is being spent in a good program, and that's why we can agree.

213
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,000
More than, we got 50 grand out of them, so vote with us.

214
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Representative Nagel.

215
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:51,500
I'll be honest, it's like a lot of votes we have here we're not trying to sway the people the extremes we're trying to sway people in the middle i mean that's the only group we're looking at we could you know we're not changing anybody i'm aware of the time you folks now have to leave right we do very soon all right so what's the pleasure of the group?

216
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,000
Obviously, we know where the Senate stands.

217
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It stays as is.

218
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Representative Merchant?

219
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Given the fact, I think the underlying bill to begin with is very critical to a lot of the residential facilities in order to help them out.

220
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I'm willing to concede to the Senate $300,000 versus $250,000.

221
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I think the roll the dice in the House and at that point in time see what happens.

222
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,000
I totally agree with what you're saying, Senator Pearl.

223
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:45,500
So I'm recommending to the caucus on the House side is that we keep it at $300,000 and see what we can do when it gets to the House.

224
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Representative Navel.

225
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Oh, I'm not.

226
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I'm fine.

227
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

228
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Representative Weber, I'm assuming you are.

229
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I am also fine.

230
00:28:58,500 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm hoping very much that my friends on the other side of the aisle in the Senate will make some phone calls To people that they think might be convinced Because I think I think that would might be helpful um we all know there are people that a phone call will set off but um but i i certainly want to keep this alive by all means and senator carson you're on board senator pearl is on board senator perkins book is on board yes sir and with my reservations earlier expressed i think there's more pluses than minuses in this bill i don't want to tank the bill over and be the one that um kills this whole deal so i will support it also and i guess we'll find out next thursday and and just one further qualification Mr.

231
00:30:09,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Chairman, we are all very clear because we were clear to begin with that what we are doing is exceeding to the Senate position in its entirety and we are going to be darn sure that it that the word non-injectable in is there in the version that we sign off yes yes um just to clarify Representative Weber that was a floor amendment that Representative Murchis suggested and we did pass on I I understand that night I know it happened I just was working my way through the paperwork to be sure that The next time we present it to somebody it's still in there That we all know we's what we agreed to.

232
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Okay, okay.

233
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
All right.

234
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:19,000
We all know this has to be signed off on before 4 o'clock on Thursday.

235
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
All right.

236
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Thank you.

237
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000

312
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Thank you.

313
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Thank you.

314
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Thank you.

315
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Thank you.

316
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Thank you.

317
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Thank you.

318
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Thank you.

319
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Thank you.

320
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Thank you.

321
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Thank you.

322
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Thank you.

323
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Thank you.

324
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Thank you.

325
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Thank you.

326
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Thank you.

327
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Thank you.

328
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Thank you.

329
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Thank you.

330
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Thank you.

331
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Thank you.

332
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Thank you.

333
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Thank you.

334
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Thank you.

335
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Thank you.

336
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Thank you.

337
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Thank you.

338
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Thank you.

339
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Thank you.

340
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Thank you.

341
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Yep.

342
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
No, please, please approach.

343
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
No.

344
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Okay.

345
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Okay.

346
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Good morning, all.

347
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Welcome to Public Works and Highways.

348
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,000
We will open the Committee of Conference on House Bill 2024.

349
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Before I do, I want to thank the Senate President for being here, Chairman Bishardi and Sandra Waters.

350
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm joined by my public works, Eaton, Mills, and Cluedier.

351
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I would just like to say before we start, collectively between the four of us sitting here, it's over 84 years of service here in the house and a great majority of that in Public Works and Highways.

352
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:14,500
I would, I'm on the understanding that the Item 7 in this, in our legislation here, Established Retirement System Benefit for Group 2 Members Who Retire Due to a Violent Act of Injury injury can be removed from here as it was taken care of elsewhere in the budget, or excuse me, elsewhere.

353
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:27,500
I would also say as a House position that we concur with the changes or amendments that were added from the Senate back to our bill.

354
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:43,500
So everything that's included in this document with taking item seven out, and I'll open it up for discussion, but I believe we as the House position are in favor of that.

355
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Thank you.

356
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:59,000
What we are not in favor of is the Senate's position that they removed Section 10 Continental Boulevard and inserts effective dates of new subject matter added.

357
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It is our House position, while we agree on everything else in this document, the House position is that the House was turning over Continental Boulevard from town, from state control to the town.

358
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,500
And that's the position, and I'm open to a discussion, that is the position of the House.

359
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,000
And I'll leave with one more item on that.

360
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,000
sitting in the room, I have other members of Public Works and Highways, which comes out to nearly 70 years of service.

361
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,500
I have two chairmen, a vice chairman.

362
00:37:43,500 --> 00:38:07,500
It has always been the position of this committee, the Cont that the town of merrimack uh wanted wanted that highway uh entrances made uh for the turnpike system and uh legislation over the years had taken that away so i'm happy to have a conversation uh chairman.

363
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
President, if you feel that's warranted.

364
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Thank you.

365
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
I'll be brief.

366
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,000
I appreciate your position on this and respectfully disagree.

367
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The town of Merrimack has gone through an awful lot and i don't understand why they should incur this expense and maintain this road when everyone who travels it is not just from merrimack it's really is a state road i i just don't see why they should be subject to that and so i'm going to to have to disagree and stand with the people of Merrimack.

368
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Thank you, Senator.

369
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
There are a conversation.

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll come.

371
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I appreciate your sentiments that it doesn't serve just the town of Merrimack, but there's not a road in the state of New Hampshire that serves just an individual town.

372
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:39,500
The fact is, I've been here 40 some regardless of the agreements, promises, and going with the history of the road from its inception to now, it should go back to where it belongs and let them continue their economic engine and take more benefit from it under their own control.

373
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Senator Waters, please.

374
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Thank you, Mr.

375
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Chairman.

376
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:53,500
And, you know, I think you're going to hear very strongly we're defending the Senate position.

377
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:08,000
But just since you mentioned all the 84 years, a lot of us do have history around this, removal of the tolls, the continental boulevard issue, and so on.

378
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And we have had either in bills or in the 10-year plan some discussion of this for quite some time.

379
00:40:18,000 --> 00:41:29,500
I think that what is important as a new factor here this year is in talking with the DOT, they're saying we have learned to live with this and we understand that this is this has been the will of the legislature to have this situation and so i think that it will actually would do more harm than good at this point to merrimack uh and to the kind of principles that arose so with the removal of the tolls i said this is a lot of history here um i think also um you know i commend you mr chairman and your committee for you know once again producing great tenure plan and while i know this is an important issue to you all i would you know i I think that we risk an impasse on the bill over this.

380
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,500
And I don't think that's really maybe the best way to go.

381
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:47,000
But I just I think I think I think this is considered a settled by the Senate and not wanting to reopen it.

382
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Thank you.

383
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you, Senator.

384
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
To address the issue with the Department of Transportation, we collectively are the policymakers.

385
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Department of Transportation, I'm sure, would not come out in a position that would jeopardize any of their other operations.

386
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But the truth of the matter is that the Turnpike system has been impacted greatly by the removal of these tolls over the years.

387
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,500
And as any department coming in, we have corrections here and sitting others.

388
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:32,000
They're not quick to voice opinion one way or the other.

389
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We have lost millions of dollars.

390
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,500
The driver, the ridership through that area is not sustaining and coming back in numbers.

391
00:42:42,500 --> 00:43:13,500
And it continues to erode our turnpike system uh if senator lou was here he'd be talking about how not being able to get his projects done in his city and others so i certainly expect that your position would be an impasse i i i want you to understand And that we may be just there for JUST THERE FOR THAT.

392
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,500
I MAY HAVE ONE MORE THING.

393
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,000
I AGREE COMPLETELY ABOUT THE TOLL SITUATION.

394
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:32,500
AND I THINK AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS NEXT COUPLE YEARS OVER FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

395
00:43:32,500 --> 00:44:10,500
WE ARE FACED WITH THE you you know inability to raise tolls in the turnpike system which i think needs to be addressed we are also faced with issues around the road toll uh in general on with the declining potential declining in vehicle miles and also the rise of evs and trying to figure out how we're going to fairly charge folks who are driving their EVs to come out of state on our roads.

396
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:25,500
I, you know, to kind of recall William Cullen, excuse me, just to recall an earlier speech, you know, I don't want to hang Merrimack on a cross of tolls.

397
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I think we made a decision a number of years ago to take out those toll-in booths and about Continental Boulevard and reopening that right now.

398
00:44:38,500 --> 00:45:25,500
I think it, in a way, I think it unfortunately makes this the issue rather than the issue of how we're going to deal with revenues for the department of transportation over the long run so i think that you know in terms of the immediate issue that may have been called by the tolls removals i think we've got to deal with the larger package which will have to you know take that into the back to here but that's that's really all i have to say about it thank Thank you, Senator.

399
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Thank you, Mr.

400
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Chair.

401
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:38,000
So, first of all, we all recognize that the Department of Transportation is in need of funds.

402
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:47,500
As you all know, I've been trying to get remedies for the poor families impacted by the noise barriers.

403
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
So, we know that we have a situation.

404
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:05,000
And I think it would be extremely prudent of us to work on this going forward and find solutions for the Department of Transportation to have revenues.

405
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But my understanding prior to coming in here today is that, unless I misunderstood something, is that you were all right with the Merrimack decision that the Senate took on their position.

406
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,500
So I am a little surprised to hear that that is not so.

407
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't think it's responsible for us to be at an impasse and put the whole entire 10-year plan at jeopardy when you did do such a good job on it.

408
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:56,500
But I do stand with the Senate position, and I do think we have to look at things on how to generate revenue and the toll situation.

409
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:06,000
But going back in time isn't going to fix the problem or holding, you know, Merrimack hostage for it.

410
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,500
I think what we have to do is really work collectively for the greater good and find solutions ongoing.

411
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
That's all.

412
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
Thank you.

413
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Thank you.

414
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
I'm sorry, sir.

415
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Yes, we will.

416
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,500
We will be in recess for five minutes.

417
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Thank you.

418
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Thank you.

419
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
Thank you.

420
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Thank you.

421
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Thank you.

422
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Thank you.

423
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Thank you.

424
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Thank you.

425
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Thank you.

426
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Thank you.

427
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Thank you.

428
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Thank you.

429
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Thank you.

430
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Thank you.

431
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Thank you.

432
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Thank you all in attendance for your indulgence in allowing us the opportunity to have a couple conversations going here.

433
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:17,000
I'd like to recognize Representative Mills, and then I will go to Senate President Bradley.

434
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Thank you, Mr.

435
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Chair.

436
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:43,500
I just wanted to say that back in 2012, when I was a freshman here, and I don't remember the exact terms that they used to use, but we all, as new freshmen, we all had to go in and we're assigned in little groups.

437
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:57,500
And we went into different rooms and we had our first practice committee conference where we learned all the decorum, how to respond, how to address different issues.

438
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:05,500
And there was always only two episodes and they were always old bills that had failed.

439
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:20,500
One was a finance bill that I didn't sit in on, but the one that the rest of us had was the town of Merrimack, the tolls and Continental Boulevard.

440
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:42,000
And we were presented, we were presented with every piece of paper that the town had ever presented to beg the state to extend the tollway system in so that digital could go in and that exits 10, 11, 12 were put in.

441
00:49:42,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Continental Boulevard was actually, I believe it was a different name at the time, but it was renamed Continental Boulevard and reinforced simply so that the DOT at the time could put in maintenance and they reinforced it for their heavy trucks.

442
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,500
And without a doubt, every year they did that, and there was always two outcomes.

443
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:30,500
It never passed, even in practice committees, it never passed, or there was always the option that if that ever happened, if the town ever wanted to remove the tolls, they would have to assume ownership of Continental Boulevard again.

444
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:37,000
So that's just a little history that never, ever, ever, ever went away.

445
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Thank you.

446
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Thank you, Representative Mills.

447
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,500
And I probably would just strike one word being the word beg that was offered in there.

448
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:56,000
It just it goes to the passion of this committee over the years.

449
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Senate President Bradley.

450
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So thank you very much, Mr.

451
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Chair.

452
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So I've also had a bit of history on this issue going back to when I was in the House and the town of Merrimack was trying back then in the 90s to get rid of the tolls.

453
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:51,500
having also represented Merrimack in a different part of my time, I have come to the conclusion that merrimack being the only town in the state that had to have tolls to get entrance ramps off of any of the turnpike systems was patently unfair so the question to me is how do we get to a fair solution?

454
00:51:51,500 --> 00:52:03,500
And it's one of those things that probably nobody's going to be happy, but what I'm going to propose, and then I think, Mr.

455
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Chair, we should probably take a recess afterwards, come back tomorrow, and let everybody have a chance to digest it.

456
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:42,000
But what I'm going to propose is that we continue state maintenance of of um continental boulevard for five years so it would be 2029 i believe that would um put the town of merrimack past the next paving upgrade which i think is probably the next two or three years from what the commissioner has said.

457
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,500
It would allow both sides to have an opportunity to readdress it in five years.

458
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:59,000
But for the town of Merrimack, who probably thinks I'm selling them down the drain, I really am not.

459
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Because here's why.

460
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,500
This issue is going to come back every 10-year highway plan.

461
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
We could hold tight.

462
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,000
We could threaten to walk.

463
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We could play chicken.

464
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Somebody wins.

465
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Somebody loses.

466
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,500
Maybe we don't have a 10-year plan.

467
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Maybe we do.

468
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,000
If we don't have a 10-year plan, everybody loses.

469
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So I think, you know, in my conversations with, you know, Representative McConkie, we've both agreed that a 10-year plan, killing it over Continental Boulevard is just a non-starter, okay?

470
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's just a reality, or it should be a reality.

471
00:53:47,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So, in my mind, coming up with something that gives the town of Merrimack five years of breathing room and a paving is something that you don't have right now.

472
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Because this issue, even if the Senate position establishes itself over the next, you know, two days, and everybody agrees, the House backs down, Continentallevard stays in reality is in it it ain't going away it's coming back in 2026 next 10-year plan same thing it'll be fought representative mcconkey hopefully he'll be a senator life may look a little different but maybe it won't look different but there'll be other people that are trying to do the same thing.

473
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So my proposal will give you five years of, you know, more certainty and a paving.

474
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So I hope that we can take a recess for 24 hours, let everybody cogitate on it from Merrimack to the commissioner's office, to the House, and to colleagues in the senate so that's what i would propose i'm happy to prepare the amendment and uh we come back and i i would also say mr chair um and madam chair um having never sat on 10-year plan but having worked on capital budgets for a while uh you guys did a great great job really fantastic job and um really glad that that bridge in charlestown is going to be delayed a couple of years to solve that problem uh representative mcconkey and i totally agree on the situation in the 45 mile an hour speed limit you Albany, the town that we both represent.

475
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,500
That's a really helpful step.

476
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Thank you for seeing it our way on the 40 year or $40 million bonding for the prison.

477
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,500
A lot of good work has been done.

478
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:20,000
So by proposing what I'm proposing, I'm trying to be fair to everybody.

479
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So thank you.

480
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Mr.

481
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Chair.

482
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Thanks, Senator.

483
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Okay, I want to commend Senator Bradley for trying to cement in an effort to reach compromise, which is aIDE OVER HERE, AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OTHER TWO SENATORS.

484
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:55,000
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE BILL 2024 WOULD REMOVE THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM BENEFIT FOR GROUP TWO, WHICH WE AGREE WITH.

485
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:21,500
And I would suggest, and I'm open for debate, why don't we prepare an amendment that does exactly what we're speaking of, have it prepared, and perhaps take a break today and prepare it, have it done, and have it prepared to be signed off this week, as opposed to having another meeting.

486
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,000
I know how busy you folks are.

487
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Would you agree to that, Senator?

488
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I would.

489
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I just think in fairness to the town of Merrimack that they probably should have a little bit of chance to talk among themselves longer than five minutes.

490
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So I do want to recess to later this hour, not recess, take a break for an hour.

491
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,500
I probably can't come back until four o'clock because how about 4 p.m.

492
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:06,000
for the I know that you're not available, but we have a majority.

493
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I can come back.

494
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm in a problem.

495
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,500
If it stays the same, you don't have to be here to vote.

496
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:24,000
You don't have to be here to vote, but I think we should come back.

497
00:58:24,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I think it's important to Merrimack that they get the reps in merrimack a little time to discuss themselves well i have two members i have uh i would like to have the senate here the uh what what what does your uh thursday look like you can do four okay or or tomorrow yeah yeah i'm mr chairman i can't be here tomorrow until it was very late it'd have to be probably four or later because of my juice so i'll i'll ask i'll ask our staff to prepare that amendment today anytime tomorrow i'll ask our staff to prepare an amendment i think we ought to see the actual language okay.

498
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm happy with that.

499
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So four o'clock tomorrow?

500
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Today.

501
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Today?

502
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Today.

503
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But I can do tomorrow too.

504
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,500
I have more flexibility tomorrow.

505
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
I'm sorry.

506
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Okay.

507
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Why don't, why don't we go?

508
00:59:43,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Yeah, I can stay okay well david well we won't be a boat we're going to be looking i can't i can't appoint anybody for your your missing my missing members at this point in time so they can sign off with representative smith's okay after so as as long as we all understand i'm more than happy to come back for four o'clock we'll give them some time to have a conversation we'll draft the amendment i think it probably should end up coming through the house though but if you want to write the language we're more than happy to do that.

509
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,000
We can put it in your name.

510
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Okay, sounds good.

511
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'll let Grant do it, though.

512
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
All right, and then we'll come back for 4 o'clock.

513
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Thank you.

514
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:00,500
But it would appear at this point in time we're in agreement, but we want to see the amendment.

515
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
All right.

516
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
Thank you.

517
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
All right.

518
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Thank you.

519
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:17,000
Thank you CLOSE THE COMMITTEE CONFERENCE ON HOUSE BILL 2024, AND WE WILL OPEN OUR NEXT 12.

520
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
12.02 in 2 minutes.

521
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,500
I just have to grab my paperwork.

522
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Thank you.

523
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Thank you.

524
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Thank you.

525
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Thank you.

526
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
Thank you.

527
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Thank you.

528
01:01:34,500 --> 01:02:12,500
I once again apologize for a little bit of a delay, having come out of our committee of conference just prior to this I am some say on the legislative side when you've been at this a while that this is almost the Super Bowl when we get down to the end but our goal always here is to is to get to a yes is where we're looking to be and compromise where we go.

529
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:25,000
So I would just like to recognize Representative Walnut sitting here, Vice Chairman Cloutier and myself, and Senator Richardi, if you could introduce your senators.

530
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Thank you, Representative McConkie and Chair.

531
01:02:28,000 --> 01:03:13,000
This is senator waters and senator gendron thank you um the bill uh the bill before us house bill 1202 was um came out of the special committee on housing uh which was brought forward by the speaker's office he and so many on both sides of this aisle recognized that we have a a real issue with working families with residents in general not being able to find affordable housing We had conversations for well over a year with developers and activist groups trying to find housing for people.

532
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:29,500
And we settled after a year on what sort of projects could we bring forward that would aid in speeding up the delivery of people wanting to build or developers in the process.

533
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:48,500
One of the sticking points that we had come to with some of the developers, especially in the southern part of the state, was how long it could take to get to yes on providing a driveway permit.

534
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:53,000
We had a lot of conversations with the department.

535
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,500
This is what we're proposing here is an evolution of that.

536
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:06,000
We had looked for a 30-day window, and this has been moved to 60 days.

537
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,500
I'm proud of that compromise.

538
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,500
We worked hard to get there.

539
01:04:11,500 --> 01:05:02,000
The Senate, in their inevitable wisdom, has agreed with our position on that, but then has added on top of that the issue of definition of disability special needs under child care would um i would welcome one of the senators to address that issue and the importance of that to us please oh thank you mr chair um i'm going to give an overview first if that's okay so people listening can understand but uh yes i work uh as often as possible with stakeholders in addressing the different issues for child care and children at risk of developmental disability.

540
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And while our existing child care framework provides necessary support for children with diagnosed disabilities, it unfortunately leaves behind those at the cusp of developmental challenges, those not yet diagnosed but showing clear signs of being at risk.

541
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And that early intervention can make such a difference on the outcome of that child as they grow into becoming an adult.

542
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,500
These are children who show clear delays in their motor function, speech, cognitive play, and social-emotional development.

543
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:50,000
Children who often later receive formal diagnosis, such as maybe autism or attention deficit disorder and other learning impairments.

544
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The evidence is clear.

545
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:09,500
The earlier way I identify that we intervene and support children who are at risk for development delay, the greater the likelihood that the child is later able to catch up academically with their peers.

546
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:21,500
So to address this issue, I introduced Senate Bill 596, which would just expand the definition of disability within our child care scholarship program.

547
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:38,000
Advocates working with the Department of Health and Human Services proposed an amendment to 596, which did not change the intent, but more efficiently outlined the process necessary to strengthen the deferential payments.

548
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So the amended version would enable Department of Health and Human Services to enter rulemaking to define the class of children and ensure that definition includes not only children that are diagnosed a delay, but those at a higher risk.

549
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So it would enable DHHS to work with experts and advocates to identify the proper screening tools and the verification needed to ensure eligible children can get the support that they need.

550
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Child care differential payments as it currently exists is grossly underutilized by our providers, in part because so few children can demonstrate a diagnosable disability when they're under the ages of three or four years old.

551
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:44,500
The policy change is not about supporting children, but also about bolstering our child care providers and enabling access to differential payments for at-risk children.

552
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:59,500
We can then provide centers with the necessary resources to maintain appropriate ratios and offer high quality care, thereby expanding access to child care for all families across our state.

553
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:17,000
With access to differential payments, centers will be able to bring in some additional staff capacity and classroom support to assist in providing these children with the hands-on learning support they need to be successful.

554
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,500
In conclusion, this bill represents a strategic, evidence-informed approach to enhancing our child care system.

555
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:34,500
It ensures that children, particularly those at risk of developmental delays, receive the support they need during their most informative.

556
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:46,000
I want to thank all of you for being here and willing to listen and work on this, and I really appreciate it.

557
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Thank you very much.

558
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Thank you, Sandra.

559
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:08,500
When I heard that this was added on to our bill, I took a special interest in it, and I tried to find what the financial burden would be to the state for this to move forward.

560
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:27,000
And I was told, and I have Representative Walner here from finance, that if this moves forward in its present form, that this is a gap that would provide funding until the next budget would come forward.

561
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,500
And so my next question is, is this a million dollars?

562
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,000
Is this a three-quarter million?

563
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Is this a half a million?

564
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:47,500
And when you start coming south of there, it starts catching my attention and getting me more in agreement.

565
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:58,000
Representative Waldner, my understanding is that this is less than $400,000 at the current estimate and possibly in the $350,000 range.

566
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Am I correct in my assumption?

567
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I believe that you probably will find that in the end, this will probably even be less than the $300,000.

568
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:21,500
This program right now, in the last fiscal year, it spent $96,000, a very small amount served about a hundred children.

569
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:27,000
And I can't imagine that this would do would double that.

570
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Maybe it might pick up a few few more children, but not not double the program.

571
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So I think that I think we're within safe range.

572
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Thank you.

573
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,500
I mean, yes, please, Senator Waters, please.

574
01:10:45,500 --> 01:11:07,000
And understanding this and the possibility of federal grants, I would point to the last part of the bill where it does say discretionary funds under ARPA and then federal funds, but any remainder not to exceed $1 shall be from general funds.

575
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So I think that that, you know, as much, I mean, it's hard to anticipate what the cost would be, but I think the language of the bill is structured to ensure that we have a lot of control over what and whether or how much at this, and there's no disagreement with the survival program.

576
01:11:35,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And it's done kind of a funny way because way because you know that last day we had to put stuff on this and that you know all about it but and I suppose daycare centers want to have driveways too okay but um I I I think that um this is a nice way of getting this the probe with the principles there the bridge the you know light touch on funding, and then gets us into the next budget where I cannot imagine a budget not wanting to take care of this program in the future.

577
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,500
So that's I just want to point out in the bill.

578
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
Thank you, Sandra.

579
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,500
I welcome your words that you just provided.

580
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:42,500
Is there anyone else who wants to speak to it before we pull this?

581
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
John, are you okay?

582
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
John D.

583
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:54,500
I'm in favor, I don't know, with all due respect, to adding this to the 1202.

584
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:01,000
It's a worthwhile program, getting a lot of emails from throughout the state.

585
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's what I believe.

586
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
John D.

587
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Thank you.

588
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Thank you, Representative Kludier.

589
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:30,500
I also have a small business owner, excavation convenience store and other activities, and so many younger people than me raising families, the child care, and anything we can do to bring that forward and make this better will just increase our workforce.

590
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:44,500
And whatever we can do to keep families living in our state is, I believe, is our charge that to me is one of the most important things.

591
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,500
So unless I hear different, we would concur.

592
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,000
The House will concur with this legislation as written.

593
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Thank you.

594
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Thank you.

595
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
We concur.

596
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Good.

597
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Thank you.

598
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,500
I'll sue your office in a minute.

599
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
Yes.

600

Sign-off must be done on Thursday.

602
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
4 p.m., I believe.

603
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,500
4 p.m., not 4.01, when Mark likes to be a couple minutes late.

786
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:40,500
I'd like to return back to Committee of Conference from our morning session, House Bill 2024.

787
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:52,500
I want to thank Senate President Bradley for the work you've done to bring this forward and the amendment, Chairman Rashardi, and Senator Waters.

788
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
So if I...

789
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:13,500
It looks to me the spirit of what we talked about this morning, Section 6 reclassifies Continental Boulevard, Town of Merrimack, as a Class 5 highway beginning July 1 of 2029 is in, which was the house position.

790
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:32,000
It adds everything we talked about this morning, a speed limit 45 miles an hour, capital appropriation for the replacement of the New Hampshire State Prison, and all the other projects that we had agreed to remain.

791
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Did Senator Birdsell's section get removed?

792
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,500
Yeah, it's not shown in here, so it's removed.

793
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
You're okay?

794
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:48,500
Senators, the House position is that we would concur with, with this as amended.

795
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Okay.

796
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,500
Okay.

797
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,000
Thank you so much for your time.

01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Really appreciate it.

799
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:18,500
I could add, I know that there's maybe a little bit of consternation from the Merrimack delegation, but honestly, I think you are so much better off with this amendment and five years of certainty than fighting it every two years.

800
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:28,000
So I hope that the good folks at Merrimack will realize what we've done is actually in their benefit.

801
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,500
So, at any rate, I hope so.

802
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
Thank you.

803
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:38,000
We'll call the committee a conference to a close.

804
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Thank you all.
