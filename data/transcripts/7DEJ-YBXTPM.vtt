fish Pier uh we did get some good bids
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
good bids in um but we were a little bit
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
short of the money uh and in instead of

of the hybrid dredge Pian maintenance
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
fund so we can do the complete project
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
and not leave one of the squares off the
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
checker board um the the commercial Pier
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
was built in uh
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
1977 uh and it's the cross bracing and
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of the structural pieces under the
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
pier and the deck on the pier
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough when we redid the
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
seaw wall that AB buts the pier we had
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
to take a row of the pilings out um
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
because the the new wall was put a few
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
feet out we took the pilings out and put
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
them in the parking lot and we sliced
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
them to see what the condition there was
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
and uh we were all just completely
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
shocked that the pilings were looked
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
like they were brand new after all of
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
these years so uh we went back in and we
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
red we Revisited the uh the what we were
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to go out to bed and we remove
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
that portion of replacing the pilings
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we just doing the cross bracing and
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
the deck and some of the fixtures on it
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
which uh reduce the price down to what
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
we have today but we were just short a
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of money and uh that's that's
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose of By Request here
 
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:49.759 align:start position:0%

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
lines there seem to be some concern but
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
initially but that's okay everything is
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay down in Ry we had some trouble with
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
the fuel lines uh it's just it's the

atmosphere in which it can you know the
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh being in the salt water and the storm
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
report that um we discussed in length at
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
the meeting in September um the
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation you'll see
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a letter from them that's
 
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.390 align:start position:0%
that there's a letter from them that's
item

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
23022 originally the plan had been for
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
the Department to come and um discuss
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
with you some of their concerns and
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
questions around the quarterly report if
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the item uh
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
23021 near the back there's a a DOT
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
addition to that quarterly report um by
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
making the name from capital budget to
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
capital projects over viw the department
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
and setting the threshold that we did at
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
the last meeting at projects of a
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
million or more it added uh several
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
hundred projects that the Department of
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation would need to report on
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
so they just wanted to come before this
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee to get a little bit um clearer
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
guidance due to timing because I
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated it would be a little bit of
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
a discussion um the chair agreed that we
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
should postpone this until the next
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
meeting which I think is planned
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
potentially for January
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
26 um and so that's why the Department's
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
not here today I had made them aware
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
that um there would probably not be a
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
discussion related to this after talking
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
with the chair and the same thing
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
happened with fishing game in terms of
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
they were going to do an update on the
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
online registration for ohrv today um
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
again due to the short time and the
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
confusion with the membership um we were
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that um we wouldn't have
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
enough time to finish that and that
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
there might be questions or people
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be prepared to have a
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
discussion today so that's all I have on
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
that unless anybody question share
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
