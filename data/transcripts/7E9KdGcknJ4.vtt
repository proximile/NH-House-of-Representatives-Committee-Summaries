84 um don't be confused by the fact that
 
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
we only have one bill that so it'll be a
 
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
a uh uncomplicated Affair but uh it's a
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
Amendment on top of amendments on top of
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendments so um we've got we've got to
 
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
maintain some some intellectual uh
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
attention going here for a little while
 
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
um first off uh we
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
Shen uh for a motion of ought to pass
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
hearings so what but what we have to
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
do I told you it was getting complicated
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
um what we're actually doing is
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
executing um s
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
sp84 but adding amendments and during
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the amendments are getting a public
 
00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
hearing as we go
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
okay right that's confusing it is yeah
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
um clear because we have a separate
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
section you'll need your microphone when
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
you need to speak but um yeah it is it
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
is a confusing thing um we are holding
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings on amendments to Senate
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 84 but we're doing it in terms of
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
um an exact session on 84 because this
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
is the last well this is our last bill
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
and we need to perform perform our
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
duties to uh execute and remove or issue
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
a final
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
report so with that um first little
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
glitch um I would ask
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely rep evil thank you um I'm on
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
the commission on commissions with the
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
chair represent ative Dolan there and I
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
know you're on it too is it not true
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
that um we had a discussion about what
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
to do with this particular commission
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
since the um the commission really was
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
created to establish the monument um and
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
so its time had kind of passed so either
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
it had to be amended um or the other
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
alternative that was suggested is that
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
it be transferred to the histor ioral
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
commission um and then I have a followup
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
is that not true that is true
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
establishing the record here okay and
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
then is it also not true that there was
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
a general consensus on the commission on
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
commissions to support this kind of
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
action to transfer it if uh um
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff felt that that
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
was appropriate that's true okay thank
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
you and I would follow up that uh
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
rep shirt lift's um acquiescence with
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
that this movement is indicated by the
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
fact that he Prime sponsored the
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that came that is true thank
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%

00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
just had a couple of quick questions
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
about um this annual index on commission
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
and why it would be appropriate for that
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
to be removed from RSA 1449 at this time
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members happy to be
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
here again Deborah Childs Deputy Chief
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
of Staff for the
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
house because when this was written we
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have the functionality to pull
 
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839 align:start position:0%
the information from the system but the
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
staff over the past year has been making
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
improvements on the statutory uh
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
commission process and a couple of
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
months ago we worked with it and created
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
an export function so if you're familiar
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the website where you can see the
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions there's now a
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
button there that says export and you
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
can export all of the data so I think
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is unnecessary and duplicative it's
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
also concerning because it says uh pull
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
the relevant information annually for
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
the speaker Senate President and and
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
other offices but it would actually be
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
that office which would know what the
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
relevant data is for each of those
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
offices so for example I work for the
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
speaker he needs certain information so
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
I would present that information to him
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
so this that could also be confusion
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
confusing but again it's I I believe
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary and duplicative to have
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
them do something that we can do at any
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
point in
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
time thank you um you have a minute for
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
a question or two yes um first off I'm
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to start it it would seem to me
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
that um and and what we're dealing with
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
just so the committee is aware there we
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
have handed out to us
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
um it says at the top Title One the
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
state and its government and it's RSA a
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
copy of RSA
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
1449 what we're cons what this amendment
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
is concerned with is um e at the
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
bottom um the question I had or the
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
point that I wanted to make sure was on
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
the record was the fact that this was
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to be done once a year on January
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
15th but now through this um
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
availability it could be drawn at any
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
point in time any any point in time by
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
anyone exactly Mr chairman you could
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
push the export functionality and have
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
the report if you wanted to um but I
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to is the key if you wanted to
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
but as I work for the speaker I will
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
pull it for the speaker when the speaker
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
wants it with the information he needs
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
and as would the person who works for
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate President great are there any
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Eagle
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so one of the and and I think
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
you sort of answered the the issue but
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
one of the big problems that we found
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
when we were originally working with the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
commission on commissions is that this
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
data it took like many many weeks to
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
pull all the data to assess whether the
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
commissions were really uh whether they
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
should be repealed whether they should
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
meet and all that sort of thing and so
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we put this in
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
the statute is just to make sure that
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
somebody was watching the you know the
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
hen house to make sure that all this
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
data was constantly being updated so um
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things on the chart that was
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
really useful that was sort of being
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
going to be reflected in the statute was
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
how frequently the Committees were
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
meeting and whether they were still
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
worthwh so what you're saying is that
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
you've updated all the it so all the
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
data that would have been in this report
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
is now going to be in the system like if
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
they're meeting is it a and and then a
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times you know a report is
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
basically reflecting what's inputed so
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
all the inputs are going to be there and
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we're
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
tracking this year after year I know you
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
have similar concerns thank you for the
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
question representative unfortunately
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
the data in the system requires a lot of
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
cleanup so that's our next project to
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
tackle this export functionality has
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
helped us significantly with that um as
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative eel mentioned we have
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
separate spreadsheets so me working for
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker I had my own spreadsheet of
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions house committee
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
Services had one the senate had one and
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many other people who work for
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
a oting authorities have their own
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so our goal is to
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
consolidate that get all on the same
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
page and just use the export
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
functionality from the tool so having
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
said that we don't have all of the
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
information that was in the spreadsheets
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
in the tool currently so we're tackling
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
that now two big efforts one we're
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the data and then two we're
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
making sure we have all of the fields
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
that we need and I promise you as long
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
as I'm here I'm not going to give up on
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
this project because it's a lot of
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
manual work that we could fix with an IT
 
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
manual work that we could fix with an IT
solution

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
so we are all of us we staff have been
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
working on this for a year year and a
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
half now meeting regularly and and
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
trying to prioritize some of the
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
improvements uh to to help automate
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
processes so I cannot tell you today
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
that we have all of the data accurate
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
and all of the fields in the spreadsheet
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we need but we are working on it
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we do have a plan to get that done
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
so one of my concerns if if we left this
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
on here and if house committee Services
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
had to pull that information together
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
for January 15th it would be a
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
significant effort because one of our
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
challenges is getting that information
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
from the 300 or so commissions that we
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
have as you know but that's something
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we're working on how can we best
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
maintain this information first of all
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
clean up the data and get it accurate
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
and complete and then maintain it going
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward so I can tell you that we're
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
working on that plan and we're all very
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
passionate about it I think legislators
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
and staff equally uh because it is so
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
timec consuming um
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
but for that to be a reason to keep the
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
legislation really concerns me because
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
it would take a lot of time and a lot of
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
work and polling house committee
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
services and and Senate committee
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
Services away from other work that they
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
do yeah I'll just do a quick B okay well
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
that that sounds great I mean I think I
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the other concern that we had when
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
we originally put this into statute is
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
just you know consistency from speaker's
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
office to speaker's office and just we
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
just really wanted to make sure that
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
there was a plan in place that these
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
things were constantly updated so if at
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
any points like legislative
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
Administration or if they wanted to look
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
at a set of commissions they'd have the
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
information there to decide so we just
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
didn't get into the hole that we were in
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
before so it sounds like there's a good
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
plan and it will come to the rescue I
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
hope so and if I may uh the way to get
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
it more consistent is to get everything
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
in the tool so instead of Deborah
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
child's updating her spreadsheet I'm
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
updating the system and so whenever
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
anybody chooses to run an export we're
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the live data we're looking
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the same thing I mean things as
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
simple as if I put in the name
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative kener and somebody else
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
puts in representative Kenneth Wier it
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's all going to be consistent going
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
forward whether it's a it's a name an
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
email an address requirements uh
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements it's it's going
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent I don't know why we had to
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
blame representative wer but
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's um any further
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
you can do that afterwards if you'd like
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
sure you'd like to speak on uh Amendment
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
2372 um chair would recognize
 
00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
2372 um chair would recognize
representative

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
Aly Susan elme
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
on uh W and means uh committee on
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
on uh Condominiums which I'll be talking
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
to you later but on I also on I started
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
that one and I started the dedicated
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
funds committee which does an incredible
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount of work every year now and um
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
both of them suffered from a number of
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
years that the Staffing was reduced up
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
here in the fourth floor and on that
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
they couldn't keep up up with all of the
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
filing we have years that are went
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
missing from the condo
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
association uh the condo committee and
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
and I know the clerk brought them up but
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
they we can't we haven't been able to
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
find them in it's been four years we've
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
been looking so
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the other thing is that on if
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
someone from that committee does not
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um at the file the back file and talk to
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
them about what belongs there and what
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't on I pulled the condo committee
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
one and there was some stuff for
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipal and County and there was some
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
stuff for something else that was
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
totally irrelevant um that had been just
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
shoveled in there when they made the
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
changes over so they are they still have
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of cleanup to do on
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
these uh thank you um do you have time
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
for a question or two my question was
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
your your pink card and I know it was
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
rushed uh doesn't say you support or
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
oppose is is this idea of having this
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
automated and be able to pull up at any
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
time beneficial to you or yes yes I
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
think the automated is
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
terrific uh I was able to find find
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
finally with some help from the fourth
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
floor on the copy of a report that um on
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
the ways and meain side that we hadn't
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
seen for quite a few years great thank
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any other
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Aly seeing
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
much I have now no other pink cards
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
um with that I think we've passed our
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
time for uh this amendment if there's
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
nothing else to bring up um I'll move on
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
to um Amendment
 
00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:10.509 align:start position:0%
to um Amendment
2023

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
2400h this is dealing with
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh a study committee um of the
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
environmental Ser Department of
 
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
environmental Ser Department of
Environmental

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
Services appeals process and um the
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
chair will recognize Vice chair Sheen
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
for introduction yes so this amendment
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
is is just a simple fix and and it's
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
just changing the date putting the date
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
out another year from November 1st 2023
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
to November 1st
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
2024 as um this committee hasn't um
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
meant to even um file a report in the
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
original report was due November 1st
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
2023 so they just need another year
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um my understanding was um the
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee were notified
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
of the appointment just at the end of
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
October um so they had uh virtually days
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
um to to organize and meet so they at
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
their request they had asked if uh if
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
they could push this off for one year so
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's changing is to my
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
understanding on that Amendment
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
is the effective or the the reporting
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
date uh to November of 2024 that's
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
correct thank you any further questions
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
um it's not really a question but I I
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that I was in a I
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
was um I was an appointee to this
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
particular uh study committee and it was
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
something that was in
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I think it was just sort of Lost
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
in the shuffle and um it's true that um
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
we weren't appointed until the week
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
before the report was due um and it's a
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
worthwhile study committee and i would
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
support this amendment so thank you
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.430 align:start position:0%

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
2400h and now we have one minute before

minute

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
okay time being 10:30
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
um I would Rec the chair would recognize
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
Vice chair shien and her Amendment um to
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
23998 good morning again um okay so this
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um is the product of uh the
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
work that's been done in the special
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions that um the
 
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
speaker um appointed us to and created
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
um really it's to weed out um committees
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
and commissions um that have outlived
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
their work and purposes and um
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
alleviating um some of the work the
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
speaker has to do in appointing a
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
members to over you know 300 committees
 
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
members to over you know 300 committees
and

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
commissions so um legislative services
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
at the beginning um when our committee
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
started meeting um handed us
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
um 10 committees or commissions that
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
they feel that need to be looked at in
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
order to determine if they should be
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
repealed or not so um these 10
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
committees were um divied out amend
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
amongst our members and uh we contact
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
contacted the chairman of these um
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees asking their
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
opinion if um they should be
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
repealed so out of the 10 uh we found
 
00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:14.909 align:start position:0%
repealed so out of the 10 uh we found
that

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
six um were ready to be repealed
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
and this is what this amendment does it
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
repeals those
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%

2012 I think it was
and

00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
um uh has been on it almost always since
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh no we it was in 10 that we we sat
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
down we've always been half Democrats
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
and half Republicans they're only four
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
of us uh and um in 2010 we sat down we
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
made a list of 12 things we thought we
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
needed to do when 11 started but then 11
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
was a little
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
chaotic and and everybody got taken off
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and some other people got
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
put on and on WE restarted in
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
13 and uh we have been working ever
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
since but we are facing some major
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
um problems on with the work we did re
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh add a great deal about governance of
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
cond s to the condominium law which had
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
been set up in
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
1977 uh in order to
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
restrain uh developers who were um
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
selling on to people properties that
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
didn't exist yet who were selling things
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been built correctly um on
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
on a bunch of other problems that I have
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
no idea what they were except there were
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems in the Market at that
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
point and so they set up something that
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
would protect the
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh on the people who were buying into
 
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.870 align:start position:0%
uh on the people who were buying into
the

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
condos what they didn't do except very
 
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.630 align:start position:0%
condos what they didn't do except very
uh

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
sarily was to tell the people in the
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
condos okay now you're the developer is
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
left you are running your own complex
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
you are responsible ible for
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
um all uh the maintenance of all the
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
Interiors you may be responsible for um
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
a septic system and you um are
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
responsible quite frequently for
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
roads um you are responsible um for
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
keeping people from killing each other
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
when they start fighting inside the
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
complex uh there you are a mini
 
00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:27.510 align:start position:0%
complex uh there you are a mini
government

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
and there is no Municipal Association to
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
help you learn to do that so the
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
boards on a lot of the bigger boards
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
hired property
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
managers and the property managers have
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
tended to take
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
over um not in all of them but in a fair
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
number of them we aren't sure how many
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and they have taken over what the boards
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
were doing they've um got people elected
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
that would do what they wanted and they
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
have ignored the new law that we put in
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
a number of times that uh so that there
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
were not elections or if there were
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
elections they were based entirely on
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
proxies that were sent out to people who
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
were second homeowners and didn't live
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
there all the time and didn't really
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
want to be bothered so they just signed
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
the proxy and send it back
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
board um a lot of the condos are good on
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
we have on the current condo board um
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
a on the chair has lived in a
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
condominium for a number of years then
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
he moved to a homeowner association
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
we're also supposed to be working with
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations we haven't gotten
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
there yet because the
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
condominium part on has been been
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
blocked frequently in the Senate by um
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
agents of the largest property managers
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
state who want to keep things the way
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
they are but we also have people coming
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
to us and now because I'm the
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
only surviving member of the condominium
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee from last term uh Senator uh
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative Ned Gordon having
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
retired uh and on the senator having
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
retired and um I
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
think think the other representative
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
didn't run again but
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
um on and I
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
get on many
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
requests from or appeals for help from
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
people that are in Condominiums that
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
have been going bad on Condominiums
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
where on the drainage has not been taken
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
care of for
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
years uh and they are Condominiums where
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
they level special assessments to take
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
care of the drainage or the roads and
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
then they use it for something
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
we all get um calls from constituents
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and problems this is dealing
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
specifically with a study committee
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
right um so I'm wondering if if all of
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
the items um that I'm hearing about uh
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's problems with how documents
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
are are drafted um and the conversations
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
between the owners is that not outside
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
the scope of this study committee that
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
is up for being removed the study
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee when I uh started it as a side
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
gek I thought that it was going to be to
 
00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
gek I thought that it was going to be to
help

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.710 align:start position:0%
help
boards

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh run their many
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
governments uh instead we have been
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of of unit owner
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
condo board uh property
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
manager problems on that what that means
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
is we need an enforcement mechanism for
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
this we've had but again that's not a
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
stud that is what we have been
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
doing I understand but that seems
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
outside if if additional legislation is
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
needed to create that enforcement that's
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
fine that's what we've been doing and it
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
and it should be would see under uh
 
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.510 align:start position:0%
and it should be would see under uh

4E recommend statutory changes or study
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
model laws for possible Improvement to
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws that seems that it
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
outside uh once that's
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
done the laws need to change not not
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
continue to act as that yeah no but I
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
have been acting like
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
it on recently the only one doing that
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
because the study committee exists and
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
people have been learning that it is
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
there and they have no idea where to go
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
on what we need is the condo dispute
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
board to get uh put into law but after
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
we have finally achieved that we will
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
cease having all these requests for
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
law that we are filtering for the Comm
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative hunt can talk
 
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
to you about that but on we have been
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
filtering them to them because people
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
tend to put in a bill for their specific
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
condo problem it does not work across
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
the board so we have been helping
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that the bills that come in
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be used usable if they
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
become law they're going to be
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
applicable to most Condominiums and the
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
other ones can get Exempted from it
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
because it just won't work for them um
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we have to do and
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
haven't done yet we're supposed to be
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
doing homeowner associations homeowner
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
associations work somewhat differently I
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
run one uh and
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
um they they do work somewhat
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
differently and they can't uh be put
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
under exactly the same laws we need to
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
spend more time talking with the people
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the homeowner associations to get
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
straight what law needs to be on the
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
books for them what they have now is
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
only their legal contract that was given
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
to them with their
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
deed um for their piece of the
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
property and it it doesn't
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
um it frequently does not fit the
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances that they need to deal
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
with I am seeing a number of questions
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
do you mind yeah rep evil thank you
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative All U Al me for coming um
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
I am on the committee on commissions
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
with uh Vanessa and the the real um
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
issue that we were wrangling with is
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether to repeal
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
commissions um that aren't really doing
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
work anymore that aren't meeting that
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
aren't you know that have felt and we
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
really didn't inquire about the
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
substantive nature of the of the
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
Committees we were basically deciding
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
whether thing you know we were looking
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
at things that hadn't met for 10 years
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
for instance and so um I would ask you
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
rather than the discussion of the
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
substantive matter that your commission
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
is dealing with could you talk a little
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
bit about it it looks to me like you've
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
you've been meeting you've issued a
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
report you're not really filling the
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not really uh the type
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
of committee that we were suggesting be
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
repealed so the question
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
is are you intending I mean it looks
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
like if your if your uh chair wrote this
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
report you are intending to you have
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
been meeting you expect to continue to
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
meet yes and that's really the issue
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with here uh in my in
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
my view anyway and then just coming off
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
of of where we were in the committee on
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
commissions and and so the reason that
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
this recommendation is even in this um
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
amendment is because we thought you guys
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
really weren't doing the job anymore uh
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
coming from us so if you could speak to
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that that you've been meeting
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
and if you continue to meet that's
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
really the issue rather than the
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
substantive nature of the committee in
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
my view anyway yeah well last
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
term I think it was not the term before
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't um formally meet at all uh
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon and I would get
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
there the senator never showed up which
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
he hadn't showed up in past years but
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
we'd had all three of the rest of us
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
working um and the the
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
um and so there wasn't a
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
quorum on the this year for the first
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
time we have four people who really are
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
committed to this work uh including the
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
senator and we've we were going to meet
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
three times but now the first time was
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
that time when it was 95° out and they
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
closed down down the uh lob so we
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to meet um we um
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
the the chair said that chair infantine
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
said that we would would uh try to meet
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
in this month which I don't think is
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
going to work and next month to continue
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
to talk about um the bill that I was
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that is the enforcement
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism um so that they could all make
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
suggestions if they think it needs to be
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
redone the last time it was redone was
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
when uh representative Gordon uh
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
polished it a bit but I think it
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
probably needs a few small
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
changes I have another question from
 
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.349 align:start position:0%
changes I have another question from
Brett

00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
Brett
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you Mr chair so we have
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
this the report that you provided um
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
before you spoke and it's dated November
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
1st of this year so I'm I'm curious as
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
to uh is this the only report that is
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
available for that committee since it's
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
exception we have uh two sets of minutes
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
for the two
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
meetings and um we did
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
not this has been fairly normal over the
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
years which is part of the problem that
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're all so busy on our own committees
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
when we're in session that we were
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to start
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
meeting in the summer but we no longer
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
meet in the summer we have vacations in
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
the whole summer and so we don't start
 
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
the whole summer and so we don't start
until

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
September and then we have September
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
October the second year is constrained
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
by the fact that we're all by October
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're campaigning hard
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
um it does make this kind of committee
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh a little difficult to get ready for
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
the next year frankly so I put in the
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
two bills that we had been planning on
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
doing before last year and and um the
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
chair is signed on to the proxy one and
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
he wants to discuss the other other one
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the whole committee before we we
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
um um before they support it follow
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the the purpose of this Committee in
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
the very very beginning back in
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
2012 was to study existing statute to
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
see um where there might be gaps or what
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
have you with regards to condo and
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
Homeowner Association uh organiz
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
structures and yes it was the purpose at
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
that time to also
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
um study that information and then take
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
feedback from constituents or homeowners
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
associations to craft new legislation to
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
try to plug those gaps or was it a kind
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
of as things came in it would give you
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
an idea okay that makes sense maybe
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's other people that are dealing
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
with this maybe we should you know um
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
create legislation to solve that problem
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
was this in your opinion an ongoing a
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
committee that was just going to be
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
forever because there would always be
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
evolving issues to contend with with
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
regards to those that's why we're trying
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
to get the enforcement mechanism it's a
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
kind of of uh
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
mediation on and once that's in place
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
when somebody has a specific problem in
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
their kind of condominium which doesn't
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
really apply to the others they can go
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
to that board and they can get case law
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
put into the court system this was done
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the UN manufactured housing board for
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
many years and they worked themselves
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
out of a job but will be out of a job
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
once we've got basic homeowner law that
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't started to work on yet Plus
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
on plus an enforcement mechanism right
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
now they can't go to the Attorney
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
General's office they won't deal with it
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
on they can't go they the only thing
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
they can do is go to Superior Court it
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
takes a minimum of two years and about
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
$20,000 to get heard in that
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
Court one more question follow up thank
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
you uh so do you have legislation in for
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
this session coming up for an En
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism yes it's the same one that we
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
were going to pass in
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
2020 when Co shut us all down do you
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
mind if we speak offline after the
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
meeting I have a couple questions that
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
relate to my living situation right
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
now see this is this
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
is what we had we had three totally
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
different kinds of groups come in in the
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
last two meetings to talk about about
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
their problems and it I must say it was
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
a very big education for the chair and
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
John scitech both of whom knew something
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
about Condominiums but it never run into
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
a bad
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
question so the final re this final
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
report um and the legislation that you
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
um put in this
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
year you're saying that that will take
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
care of your commission and no no so
 
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.510 align:start position:0%
care of your commission and no no so
okay

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
so is your
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
commission do you want to continue your
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
commission in order to take feedback
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
from constituents and problems that
 
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
they're having in their condo and
 
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.789 align:start position:0%
they're having in their condo and
homeowners

00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
associations we
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
we are getting
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
feedback whether we want it or not still
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
on the condominium issues and some from
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations we haven't
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
started the work on the homeowner
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
associations yet and the other thing
 
00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:12.670 align:start position:0%
associations yet and the other thing
that

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
until they have no place else to go they
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
come to us on for from the condo
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
associations now because there is no
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism in this State
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
except going to the superior court and
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
getting on a docket two years from now
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
well well correct me yeah correct me if
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong then shouldn't this commission
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
be repealed and a new
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
one um started because you're not
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
following um the purpose of the original
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
the the purpose is to draft legislation
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
and get it passed to
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
study laws relating to to study in order
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
to draft legislation and get it
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
passed and the second part of the
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
purpose is the homeowner associations
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
that we've been putting
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
off and because until there's an
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism it's not going to
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
help much um we've
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
um we've been passing laws and
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
I a couple of times I've I've written
 
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
letters at the behalf of of a condo
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
member uh to their Association board
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
saying here is the
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
law and uh sometimes that's worked and
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
they start obeying
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
it sometimes it doesn't because there's
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
no enforcement
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
mechanism great um any further comments
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I think we're good yeah
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
the legislation is about the enforcement
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
mechanism and then about homeowner law
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you I would like
 
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you I would like
to

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
ask um chairman Dolan to I have a
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
mind welcome to legislative
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you Mr chairman my
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
question is um the charge of your
 
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%
question is um the charge of your
committee

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
um was it purely dealing with um
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that are no
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
longer needed and or no longer
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
operating um does it have a feature for
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
those that are operating
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
outside their
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
um their original establishment
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
purpose uh well thank you for the
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
question uh We've uh continued the work
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
that was led by representative Ebert uh
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
for several years uh a lot of ditch
 
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.309 align:start position:0%
for several years uh a lot of ditch
digging

00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
digging
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
and uh uh going back through the
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
process this this committee is a a great
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
example of what the charge really was
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
and that is to
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
find uh and and root out those
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions of the 300
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
and some other that out there churning
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
that we could eliminate or combine or
 
00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:25.549 align:start position:0%
that we could eliminate or combine or
consolidate

00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh so that this particular problem is
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
emblematic of what's wrong with our
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
system that so many of us are tapped on
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
the shoulder to to fill a role on a
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission that there's
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
just no time if if if you have so many
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
places to be people don't show up
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
because they're conflicted with other
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
obligations and therefore committees
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't meet or they don't achieve a
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
quorum and uh and that's a that's a
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
that's a systemic problem uh no no
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
comment individually about this
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
particular commission and it's and it's
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
the good work that uh a lot of the
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
people that are serving on it want to do
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
but the the issue we we we looked
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
at and on this particular commission is
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
there is definitely some work that needs
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
to be done with condo associations and
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations and so forth but
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
once that work is identified
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
then our recommendation to the committee
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
is to uh Implement legislation probably
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
through Commerce to fix whatever problem
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
that they found not to continue year
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
after year to have a commission that
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
very rarely if ever meets uh to uh again
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
just it churns the cost of government
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
that we're we're all trying to keep our
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
eye on that uh that's out there that we
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
want to try to to scale back I don't
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
know if I'm answering your question but
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
but the the the issue here is once an
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
issue has been identified in this case
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
on this committee the add issue the
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
issue is we need uh Stronger laws to
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
implement then that should get
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
transferred over in this case probably
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce to to uh implement the
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
legislation or to bring forth
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to accomplish that not to
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
continue to study it at infinitum um and
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's really where the
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee's at is thank you for your
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
answer um is your
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee um capable of creating
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we C we could uh there
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
are as you know there are only certain
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities or Windows in which to
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
create that legislation the next window
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
for us really is going to be next
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
year uh when the when the window opens
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
for new legislation or there is a an
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
alternate path through the rules
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee to enable special legislation
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
to be created with the approval of the
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
rules committee as an exception to the
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
rule uh and so so that window is
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
available to us I would I would suspect
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
that this committee that that I chair
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
will continue to dig at uh committees
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
and commissions to look for
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities to consolidate or reduce
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
the number of committees and commissions
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
that were all obligated uh to sit on and
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
to serve uh uh going forward final
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
question for me
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
um would it
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
upset the charge of your committee um
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
for us to e extend the time period um or
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
terminating this committee um to give
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
that time to be able to create create
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation in Commerce or whoever
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
um you suggest in order
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
to um better better determine the
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
purpose uh of of what's actually
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
occurring within the guise of a study
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee it would not up upset us at
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
all uh and I would defer it to uh
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen uh on that but uh
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have representative wall from this
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sheen we have
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
the minority leader uh we have
 
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.789 align:start position:0%
the minority leader uh we have
representative

01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
Abel excuse me that uh that sit on this
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
committee and I think we're we're all in
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
general favor of allowing committees
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
commissions to continue that are doing
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
good work and V and add value to to our
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
process so we would certainly support
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
any decision you want to make along
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
those lines great thank you very much I
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
have one or two other questions for U
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
rep uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um regarding the
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
um condo associations it's my
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that Commerce just I think
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
this term um created um a subcommittee
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
just for condos and and and that sort of
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
thing because it you know it's just
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
grown to to a level that they they can
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
have their own subcommittee and it seems
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
to me that would wouldn't that be the
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
place for the ongoing as as we get ideas
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
for legislation that that it should that
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
this committee this study committee
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
could be funneled into that subcommittee
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and I
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
more rep Carter thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm a freshman I'm trying to
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand this Theory
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
correctly is a
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
study committee relative to the laws of
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
whatever condos or Finance pollution uh
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of that committee to
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
study the activity within our government
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
related to that issue or is that
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee also supposed to function with
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
a marketing marketed effort uh to field
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
constituent concerns and questions I'm
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure I
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand it's my understanding was
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
these committees are kind of an internal
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
group working together to
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
solve issues interde departmental or you
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
know conflicting legislation it's not
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily something where you have an
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
Information Hotline that constituents
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
are reaching out to those study
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
committees am I incorrect uh no you're
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct the the purpose of
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
most uh study committees and commissions
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
is not to serve as a um as a complaint
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh desk for for the uh for constituents
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's something to be this
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
should these study committees and
 
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
commissions should be serving uh those
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
of you sitting around the table as you
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
consider uh what action to take or not
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
take uh depending on that particular
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee or commission so uh when
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
constituents have complaints they
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
certainly need to be dealt with uh and
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues if I may Mr
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we have is
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
especially with freshmen uh is that uh
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
what do you do with a a study commission
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
or committee how do you how do you
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
invoke one and when is the right time to
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
do that so so this committee that that I
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh it's a it's a committee of 10
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
of relatively senior people with
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
experience and what what they look at is
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
what's the process of doing this and
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the things we we have
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
focused on in the past year what's the
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
process so when you go to uh
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
OS with a with a hot idea in your mind
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
fresh fresh probably from a meeting with
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
constituents at a in the back of a
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
school board meeting or or or a council
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
meeting or whatever you come all
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
energized ready to imp to uh to study
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
something and what happen is you go to
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
OSS and you tell them what you want to
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
get done and and going forward what
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be giving you back is a
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
a set of
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
instructions to to suggest how you go
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
about doing that have you considered X Y
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
and Z have you considered 1 two 3 4 and
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
that will help pair down the 300 or so
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
more commissions one of the things if
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
you if as you get beyond your freshman
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh term you're going to hear uh feedback
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's from o from others
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives that says something like
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
this well I know that's important to a
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
couple of constituents in my particular
 
01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:10.510 align:start position:0%
couple of constituents in my particular
community

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't see a lot of interest
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the legislature so what
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll study it that's kind
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the fallback well let's study it so
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
and and and that might be the right
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
thing to do but but when when that's our
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
fallback what happens is our system gets
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
clogged with all these study committees
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
and commissions that we have very little
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
time to go off and do what we're
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing because we're
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
sitting on so many of these commissions
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
and by the way many times we drag in
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
members of state government to sit on
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
these committees and commissions as well
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
that should be doing their work uh other
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
than that uh and at the hourly rate we
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
pay them it's a lot more expensive than
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
is for the $100 a year that you get paid
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
but they they're not at $100 a year
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
they're getting paid their due salary
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
and they to come and sit in a commission
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
that uh might spend 15 or 20 minutes uh
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
and then dismiss because a quum wasn't
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
achieved it's a very sad thing and it's
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's a sad commentary on the management
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
of of the cost of state government so we
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
want to be able to satisfy constituents
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
concerns we want to be able to satisfy
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
issues in this particular case about
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
condo associations and homeowners
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
associations we want to do it
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
efficiently and if action needs to be
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
taken in this case by uh a standing
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
committee like a Commerce Committee then
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
let's do it let's not just keep studying

um I would still
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
like to proceed as uh an ought to pass
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
and then have discussion about each of
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
the Amendments as we go and just leave
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
any of the Amendments that we have going
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
um if there are further amendments that
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
are needed that would be fine um I have
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
two prepared um we can discuss those but
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh but at the moment
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest or ask um repen to um
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
for a motion on Senate Bill
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
84 I move ought to pass repen moves
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there a second second
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
second by rep tyy
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
um there are four amendments um the bill
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
is open to Amendment uh um does anybody
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to have conversations about any of
 
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.070 align:start position:0%
want to have conversations about any of
the

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
four I thought you might yes well um I'm
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
in full support of the amendment
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the winant memorial I think uh
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
we we chatted about this a little bit
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
earlier and within the committee on
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission it made sense uh for a
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
memorial commission that had kind of
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
achieved its purpose to be transferred
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
over to the historical commission for um
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
oversight and maintenance so I'm
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
definitely in support of that one um the
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
I did have some questions about the
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
amendment um that removed the annual
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
indexing of commissions but it sounds
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
like everybody's on task and pulling in
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the same direction so uh the what this
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
particular section was trying to be
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve is being achieved I
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
hope in a better way so I'll support
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
that Amendment um the um what was the
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
other one oh the amendment on the
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
environmental councils I'm on that it
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
does need to or I saw was on that I'm I
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
think the work needs to be done so I
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
support that um the only one that I have
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
some misgiving about is
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
2399 as it's structured you did uh ask
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
chair Dolan whether he would be amable
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our committee to extend the
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
life of the condo study committee by one
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
year I think based on the input from
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Aly that would be a good
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
idea and if there was another amendment
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
that made that
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
accommodation I would support that
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
else you are the minable commission here
 
01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.709 align:start position:0%
else you are the minable commission here
committee

01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
um I um I too um would
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
support on the final Amendment uh the
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
2399 H um I
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
am persuaded that um while I
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't well I don't believe um the work
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the study committee is actually
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
doing um
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
follows uh what the original purpose of
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
the of the language is um in the in the
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
RSA I do think that it's valuable and I
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
do think that um they should be given
 
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:17.790 align:start position:0%
do think that um they should be given
the

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make the
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
case as it says um recommend statutory
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
changes and study model laws uh for
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
possible Improvement I think that's what
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing um and I think they have
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
um perhaps uh it's not within this
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
commission this committee's duties to
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether those laws are are um
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not I think that has been
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out that it should be done
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
within Commerce um and I understand that
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
there is an LSR at least maybe a bill
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
number now for doing some of that um I
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
would have no problem
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
extending or amending uh 23 99h um on
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.669 align:start position:0%
extending or amending uh 23 99h um on
that

01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
that
particular

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
um committee list um of those six to
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
extend that for an additional year um I
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
think I think that would be appro
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
rate um rep M and I'm fine with all the
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
other three I mean they all just seem to
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
make sense to me uh it's it's more of a
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
cleanup than anything else cleanup on
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
aisle to um rep mcarter you have a
 
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
point would this uh Senate Bill 84 would
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
this be um an appropriate addition or
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill to require when a
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
new committee or or um task force um
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
commission is established that it must
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
contain some sort of a Sunset date it's
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
got to have its work concluded by uh you
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
know whatever the the Germaine period of
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
time would be for the particular item is
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
that is this the bill that that kind of
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
language should should work it around
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:23.709 align:start position:0%
 
chair

01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
is it possible
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
to you've seen right now we're building
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
an Omnibus build basically um so is it
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
possible to go on there sure it's
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
possible um I would suggest however that
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
already in statute are Provisions that
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
do exactly what you're saying um there's
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually an LSR I've seen that actually
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
is is talking to that as well so my my
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
here I'm sorry oh sorry so you're saying
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
that there already is statute that uh
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
prescribes for
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
that yes and what is does that pertain
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
to every study committee um I can look
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
it up myself yes it does um it's in
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
actually if you look on the the sheet
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
here for 1449 yeah if you look
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
2 okay I think that's what you're
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
people the thing is
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
um this committee on commissions and
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
committees is working
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
through all of those and I'm not sure if
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's all 300 but but a lot of those were
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
created prior to this going into effect
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
I see so a lot of those I think will be
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
taken care of by that five-year Sunset
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
but right now they're working on those
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that prior to that fiveyear window
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
occurring rep sers yeah thank you Mr
 
01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:23.669 align:start position:0%
occurring rep sers yeah thank you Mr
chair

01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
so so it's I I think all of these should
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass at this point here and
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
as far as giving another year that's
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
really that's being generous I think
 
01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.229 align:start position:0%
really that's being generous I think
honestly

01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
um especially that one committee there
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
as far as Condominiums and
 
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners it's been in business for 14
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
years 14 years I mean how many more
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
years do you need to study something and
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
almost every
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
banal since we're changing
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives all the time and and
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
even Senators it seems like we're we're
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
starting all over again so or for the
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
most part so I I think it should just go
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
as it is and uh that's my thought on
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you anyone else
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
here well let let's just start with a
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
straw pole on the first one does anyone
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
241h all in favor of that say I I all
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
there um St pole on 23 372 H which is
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
um the annual index of all of the
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
commissions that now is available online
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
and can be drawn up at any time does
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
anyone have any issues
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
opposed then
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
opposed then
2400

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
2400
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
H um this is the bill that because of um
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's a snafu with it being in
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 or just no one understood that it or
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
recognized it and it came out late and
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
everyone was appointed late and now they
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
want an additional year are there any
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
discussion points on
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
that all those in favor of
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.470 align:start position:0%
that all those in favor of
2400h

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
2400h
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
opposed now we get to 2399 H um all
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
those that um I'm going to go out on the
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
limit say all those that are
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
opposed um no all those that are in
 
01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.669 align:start position:0%
opposed um no all those that are in
favor

01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
of allowing an addition year before
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
termination signify by saying I I Al
 
01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.430 align:start position:0%
termination signify by saying I I Al
those

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
opposed it sounds to me like there's
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
more eyes than there were
 
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.750 align:start position:0%
more eyes than there were
nay

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
nay
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
um I suppose there's a third option in
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
there um of completely pulling it from
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
that list of six and and it going on on
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
its merry way I don't feel that the
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee um well I'll I'll put it out
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
um does anyone want to just pull that
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
completely and and uh and let it
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
continue to go as it on its
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
own question U yes for chairman
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
Dolan uh your committee is still uh
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
functioning um it's still got time to go
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
so you'll still be looking
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
at uh reviewing various committees and
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
commissions that are still functioning
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
you would still be uh reviewing them so
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
if this one's totally pulled out right
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
now you'd take a look at it at your next
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
meeting next year or the year after and
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
see if it was a good time to get rid of
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
point yes thank you for the question um
 
01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.790 align:start position:0%
point yes thank you for the question um
yes

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh but uh know that this window of
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity is by uh piggybacking on
 
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity is by uh piggybacking on
this

01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment the uh if a subsequent a
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
action were to be taken on this as as a
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
standalone it would need special
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
permission from the rules committee in
 
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
order to bring that forward which we can
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
get I think we can get depending on the
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
speaker uh and uh his staff but uh it's
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's just more difficult but it can be
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you thank you rep Sheen
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and I understand what you're saying
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
there rep attorney but if we're going to
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
do that we might as well just extend it
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
a year um and keep that change in the
 
01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
amendment you know instead of throwing
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
it back to the special committee on
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
commissions where we have a lot more
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
things to look at as well we've looked
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
at this and you know we're making a a
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
graceful um compromise and letting it um
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
um my opinion so here we go um I have
 
01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.270 align:start position:0%
um my opinion so here we go um I have
[Music]

01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.189 align:start position:0%
two amendments
coincidentally

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
coincidentally
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
um in my hot little hands here uh one of
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
them and and what I'll do is is call the
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
role on uh the official role on two on
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
these two what we have to do is
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
consolidate uh a bill can only have one
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment so what we're doing is
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
consolidating all of these into one
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment onto Senate Bill 884 replacing
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
all the language that exists on Senate
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 84 with one or the other of these
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
two amendments that I
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
have one of
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
them extends
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
for a period of one
 
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.350 align:start position:0%

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
immediately um that's the only
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
difference between these two
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the one-year extension if that pass
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
