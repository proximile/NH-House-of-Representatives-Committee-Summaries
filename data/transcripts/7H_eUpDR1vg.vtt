00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
classifications and pay levels um
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
it's just that the the bulk of changes
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing now
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
as a carryover from years before
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't exclude anybody and it
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't automatically include anybody
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh senator i have a question
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes i noticed that you're changing the
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
jcec to biennial which makes perfect
 
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.029 align:start position:0%
jcec to biennial which makes perfect
sense

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
and you're also stretching
 
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.230 align:start position:0%
and you're also stretching
the

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
reviews hhs's reviews of their
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
management structure from four years to
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
seven years
uh

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
could you explain that
 
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
could you explain that
the

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think the commissioner myers at the
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
time thought that the that
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
reclassification would go a lot faster
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
than it has been going
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
they just wanted this cushion
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
because it involves 80 some positions
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
that are being reclassified
 
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
that are being reclassified
and

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
it was a constant source of confusion on
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
jcec um
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt and i have served
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.910 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt and i have served
for

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
more than 14 years on the
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
on this committee and it is
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's always awkward and
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't never figure out why
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
they went to a one-year rotation and not
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
for the session
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
so it just made sense like you said
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.350 align:start position:0%
madam chair
okay

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
is is the only way to do this through
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislation because if we
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
or is there another it is okay thank you
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes these positions are in statute
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
and therefore that we have to have
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to change the statute
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes representative schmidt
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
so if i'm as uh senator reagan has
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
alluded to me i could add just a couple
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
of words for one thing the jcec does not
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
meet on a regular basis it meets as
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
needed with regard to positions that are
 
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
needed with regard to positions that are
being

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
being
added

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
added
or

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
promoted or changed in some cash
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the jcec is the
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh with regards to that
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is the function of the edna
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee that's why senator reagan is
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
here today with this bill
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
subsequently to our action in edna
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
the finance committee will then take up
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
any financial aspects of any decision
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the jc ec has made
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
but because we don't meet regularly or
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
we only meet at the call of the chair so
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
to the degree that we're not meeting at
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
the time that the
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
session changes from one year to the
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
next it's very
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
awkward and unwieldy and that's why that
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
aspect is being changed
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you senator
 
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.949 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you senator
and

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
i will be presenting the amendment that
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
you approved
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
from commissioner arlinghaus later
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
after we finished with the bill
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
senator carson
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and good
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
morning uh committee members um for the
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
record my name is sharon carson and i
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
represent senate district 14 comprising
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
the towns of londonderry hudson and
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
auburn and i have part two
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
of this omnibus bill this morning for
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
your consideration which deals with
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
reverse auctions and this was a request
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the department of administrative
 
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.389 align:start position:0%
of the department of administrative
services

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
services
briefly

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
reverse auctions are an electronic
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
bidding process in which bidders make
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
offers to supply commodities or services
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
to the state at increasingly lower
 
00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.150 align:start position:0%
to the state at increasingly lower
prices

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
prices
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
they are a live event where suppliers
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
compete in open forum to offer their
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
best possible prices
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
reverse auctions are currently being
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
used as a tool to apply downward
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
pressure on suppliers in conjunction
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the public bidding process
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
traditional electronic reverse auctions
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
have a track record of success in our
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
state counterparts including mass
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
vermont connecticut and rhode island and
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
have proven to facilitate securing
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
substantially lower prices than a
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
traditional procurement approach
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between new hampshire and
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
other states is that reversed auctions
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
are currently performed as part of the
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
rfp process in advance of any public
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
bid opening
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation should ideally create a
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
future state which prohibits the release
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
of specific vendors pricing information
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the conclusion of a reverse
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
option thereby maximizing cost
 
00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:37.430 align:start position:0%
option thereby maximizing cost
reductions

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
adoption of this legislation would
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
streamlight the state's reverse bidding
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
process and potentially
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce prices paid by the
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
for goods and services
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
madam chair i have received some
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
language for a potential amendment
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to say that there's one
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
comment addressed at the time of our
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
submission of a fiscal note worksheet on
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
this matters
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
um reverse auction raised technical
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions relating to the application of
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
the provision of rsa 91a
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and rsa 21g colon 37 which is disclosure
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
of financial information regarding
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
requests for bids and requests for
 
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.829 align:start position:0%
requests for bids and requests for
proposal

00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
and it says in order to address those
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
concerns they believe that the uh
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
language that they'd like to present in
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
the following paragraph should be added
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
to the bill um that
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
amendment madam chair is in the process
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
of being
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
written up by ols and i will get it to
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
you just as soon as it is available so
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
it will be made available to your

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
and administrator uh
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
for policies and guidelines tom care
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the reverse auctions
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
we've had some successes and we've
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
collaborated with some other states
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh recently concluding
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
a joint venture with the state of
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
vermont with regard to road salt and we
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
achieved significant cost savings
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
in summary in essence what it allows us
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
is provide perform a
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
best and final live bidding
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
process electronically whereby the
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
bidders do not see who they're bidding
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
against they're just a number as the
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
price bids continue to go go lower
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
and more competitive it just makes for a
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any questions
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%

something you're speaking more loudly
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'll uh
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know along with um
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
goods like hard goods do you uh
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the department with
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
departments might be it might need this
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
for services
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking into
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
services that would
 
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
services that would
work

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
so the answer is yes the short answer is
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh the the volume of services that
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to run through
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
will be i would say on a limited more
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
limited basis than obviously commodities
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up so when you
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
enter these um requests are there
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
specifications that go along with it
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
whether they be products or services
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes correct
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair
 
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair
um

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you can tell me how
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
this affects
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
the rfp process because i know that the
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
current process
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
at least some of the time um depends
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
what the what you're looking for would
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a bidder's conference and answer
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
the rfb process the only difference with
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
passing in this bill will will the
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
difference will be
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
the bids will not be disclosed until the
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
actual reverse auction
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh the way the laws
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have we have to re we have to receive
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
the bids through a public opening
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that price point sets the bar
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
for the beginning and commencement of
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
the subsequent reverse auction this will
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
just close the loop
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
and it nothing will be released until
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
we we complete the actual
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.430 align:start position:0%
we we complete the actual
process

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
 
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.669 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
well

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you so if i if i understand
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um suppose if you
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
were looking for a reverse auction for
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
paving the highway something like that
 
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.549 align:start position:0%
paving the highway something like that
then

00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
you would still issue the rfp
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
and there would still be an opportunity
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
for anybody to ask questions about clear
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
and clarifications is that correct and
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
and then the next step would be that
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
they would submit their bids but
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
is that is that how it goes
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
yes the irb would be issued we'd have a
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
question and answer period
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
defined for any clarification
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the process really would remain
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
unchanged the only difference would be
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
upon uh submission and receipt of the
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
proposals or quotes
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
nothing would be released until the
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the process of research
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that that clarifies what
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
i was uh asking about thank you
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%

has joined us if you'd uh
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
while we have yesterday
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%

you said nothing is revealed until the
 
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
you said nothing is revealed until the
uh

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the contract the resulting contract
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the price point would be disclosed
 
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.830 align:start position:0%
and the price point would be disclosed
publicly

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
as it is today only would be at the
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
that would be correct assuming the
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%

and so forth so he is the other key
player

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
player
 
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
player
and

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
he is the one that
 
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
he is the one that
informs

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
informs
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh of the and that's when the the
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
jcec will meet it's not on a regular
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
basis at all thank you representative
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
are there bids that enter through this
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
reverse auction are they from approved
 
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.590 align:start position:0%
reverse auction are they from approved
suppliers

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
do you have a list of of approved
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
suppliers or can are they the ones that
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
that enter in this reverse auction
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
or can anyone
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
they have to be a registered veteran
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire they all
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
are pre-qualified thank you
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.470 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
fellows

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just wondering
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
is is there still is there something in
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
that would um let you exclude a low
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
bidder if these people have done jobs
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
for the state before and and you think
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
so before it goes to our reverse auction
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
contract uh service provider we our team
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
in procurement does an analysis both a
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
technical and commercial review so our
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
process really doesn't change
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh prior to it going to the to the
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
so yes the answer is yes we would stop
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
anybody that is
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh on a department list or if they
 
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh on a department list or if they
perform

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
poorly or if they're not technically
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
compliant to the specifications
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and de roy you have a
 
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and de roy you have a
question

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
is there uh
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
situations where you would not take the
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
lowest bidder
 
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.260 align:start position:0%
lowest bidder
and

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:11.270 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with keeping them to
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
that low bid in other words cost
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
that low bid in other words cost
overruns

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
overruns
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
um so if there were a technical reason
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
for that to happen we probably would not
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
have them participate in the actual
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
live auction
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
process we catch that up front
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
and it have to be a specific
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
reason of validation not to
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
pursue that
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh avenue so i'm not sure i answered
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
your question but we would have a
 
00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.269 align:start position:0%
your question but we would have a
process

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
to stop that
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
let me let me give that a little bit of
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
a shot this is um charlie arlinghaus i'm
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department
 
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department
um

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
 
technically

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
while there it is possible to not accept
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
a low bidder if you if you find
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
something wrong with the low bidder you
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
would realistically have to find
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
something wrong with the low bidder the
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the state's competitive bidding
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
statutes are designed as much as
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
possible to eliminate judgment
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
from it what what the what policymakers
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
have decided over over many years since
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
have decided over over many years since
um

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
since a predecessor of mine went to jail
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the 1940s over bidding um
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
one they've decided that it's very
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
important that there be a process that
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
is as open as possible
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wins the bid
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a manager who goes geez you
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
know i didn't i don't like that i mean i
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
we were really hoping to use home depot
 
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
we were really hoping to use home depot
or

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's a bad example but you know what i
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
mean um
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have to be very skeptical of that you
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
you can't want to use somebody because
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable so somebody is a low
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
bid and is going to be disqualified um
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
you have to be very careful that that
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
company that ends up getting
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
disqualified would have us would have a
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
strong ability to sue
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't happen very much typically
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
what would happen is they would not
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
reach the point where they were able to
 
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.230 align:start position:0%
reach the point where they were able to
bid

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
bid
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
for example on construction contracts um
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the department division of
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
public works um there's a there's a
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
pre-qualified list
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
occasionally people uh people are banned
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
from bidding or there's a card in their
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
file so they don't they can't bid on
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
state work but once they qualify to bid
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
you're generally saying that we accept
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
you unless for some reason
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
you figured out they they they couldn't
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
bid or there was a problem
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
there are some rfps
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh proposals
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
um where there's a technical component
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
to them as well as a financial component
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
and so um there are occasions typically
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
i know this is true with us on
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
on a bunch of our large contracts
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.190 align:start position:0%
on a bunch of our large contracts
um

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
the low financial bidder is the one who
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
likely wins and the technical elements
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
are close but there is the possibility
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
that somebody is technically very very
 
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
that somebody is technically very very
weak

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
weak
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
um and their pricing point is a little
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
bit higher and those those contracts are
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
awarded um
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
essentially on a point system where
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
finances are one component of technical
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
qualifications are another but we have
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be very very careful the mandate for
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
us in the competitive bidding process
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
is to um is to be as as dispassionate
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
and as neutral as as possible
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
and if i may just add to that conclusion
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's why a lot of services won't
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
really apply for this platform
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity that's really primarily
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
geared to i say widgets commodities that
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
are vanilla
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh and easy to
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
meet a specification and really that it
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
does become complying with the rsas
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
which is low price prevails
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow up please
 
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.190 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow up please
please

00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
um i guess the second part of my
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
question with regards to cost overruns
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
ties into the low bidder thing is
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
if someone is uh
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
under bidding
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
what they should do just to get the
 
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
what they should do just to get the
award

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
award
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
are they prevented then from uh
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
building the state from war because of
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
cost overruns because they under bid
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
just to get the contract
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great question and it's
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that comes up in uh
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in construction contracts
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
both ones we administer
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and obviously dot ones um this came
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
up with the governor and council a while
 
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
up with the governor and council a while
ago

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a contracting process they
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be held to a contract
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the contract is uh we have very good
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
contracts in the state um from the state
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
perspective from the contractor
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
perspective they might not agree um
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
because their hands are very much tied
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
every contract of that nature naturally
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
has a change order process because
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
things do change and you find unknown
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
conditions etc but change orders are
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
things that have to be agreed to by both
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
sides and they're done very carefully
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
and judiciously
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody is a particularly low bid
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
so on think of a large construction
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
contract where we we produce an estimate
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and let's just say for the sake of
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
argument there were four bits and they
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
were 3.6 3.5 3.4 million
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then somebody been 2.1
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
before as part of the contracting
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
process before you would contract with
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
the person who was
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
remarkably low and surprisingly low
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a piece of information
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
you hear in your head and you think
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
oh did they miss something did they did
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
they see page 12 you know that kind of
 
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.149 align:start position:0%
they see page 12 you know that kind of
thing

00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
and you would have a conversation with
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
them and say you understand what you're
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
you understand the same process which is
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit cumbersome uh compared to a
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
lot of what you're used to and we have a
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
discussion with them
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
um occasionally what will happen is
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
there'll be somebody who says no i get
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
it i understand this we just say work
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the time i get what i'm doing
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh i got a good deal on paint
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and i'm gonna use it on the
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
process so we're good um but there's a
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
discussion occasionally somebody will
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
say oh i didn't realize that and and we
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
would explain to them
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
change orders are gonna be very hard to
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
come by just so you know
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so they know what they're getting
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
into so typically
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
someone like that might in the end walk
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
away doesn't happen much just because
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
the process of getting to be a bitter on
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
state work
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
is um is difficult in and of itself
 
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
is um is difficult in and of itself
but

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
part of that process is solved by
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
conversations and part of it is by
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
holding people to a contract where
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know they've been low and
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
we've had vendors who say
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize how low i was bidding
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm losing money and if i'm honest
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
our answer is typically um
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that but we do have a
 
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.789 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that but we do have a
contract

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question was
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
answered in the course of
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
previous conversation excellence
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative fellows then
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i have a
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
the decision whether or not to use the
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
reverse auction so how will you make
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
that decision and if a potential bidder
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't like your decision do they have
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
any um option to appeal that decision
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
so we do a pre-canvas we do market
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
analysis our team here at state as well
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
as our contract service provider
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
they do an independent study they
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
analyze what the conditions of the
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
market are what the price trends are we
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
already share our budget based on our
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
incumbent uh
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
live contracts that will be expiring
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and a decision is made is it a go or no
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
go if it's a no-go meaning that we don't
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
think the reverse
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
auction would be beneficial to either
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
party whether it be the state and or
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the service provider we would
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
still do our conventional competitive
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
bid process whereby we would still issue
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
a formal rfp
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
and receive analyze and award a contract
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
so is there any appeal process if they
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
didn't like it also our rfb goes out
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
with a disclaimer with a statement in
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
there that says state reserves as its
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
sole option to exercise
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
going into
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
a reverse auction so it's uh it's our
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
decision downstream after the bids
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee oh okay that that answers my
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
question thanks
 
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
question thanks
representative

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
will there be a
 
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
will there be a
um

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else what what other
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
word to use right well will there be a
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
review or an analysis done after we've
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
used this process
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know maybe after a year to see
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
indeed if
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
this was beneficial
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
so i i would call that a post-mortem
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
right so after a certain period of time
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
we look we look to see
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i have experience with reverse
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
auctions from my previous employment
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and there were good and bad things
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
that happened as a result of that
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
um so and i was we were a supplier in
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
the in the in the position
 
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.029 align:start position:0%
the in the in the position
so

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
it can be very beneficial for the state
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
and for the supplier but it could also
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to both
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind what expectation
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any expectations
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
of a downside to this and what would
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
what might that be and how are you going
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
to prevent that from happening
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
first part of your question yes we are
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
tracking we will have metrics on a
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh we've done a couple as i mentioned
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
road salt we did with vermont uh the
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
result of that was we recognized about a
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
six percent savings vermont recognized
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
about a thirty six percent say we saved
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
four million dollars
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh we were about a half a million um
 
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.109 align:start position:0%
uh we were about a half a million um
and

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
we'll track it the vendors
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
performed this past winter uh we got
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
good feedback on it and to me it was a
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
win for the states as well as uh the
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
vendors that participated throughout the
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
regions of both states
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
we will we will our partnerships are
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
very important to us
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think that's why we do such due
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
diligence up front
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to the pre-qualification
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
and determining
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh is it a viable way to go or should we
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
do it our conventional standard
 
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
do it our conventional standard
competitive

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
paper process so we always have the
 
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.230 align:start position:0%
paper process so we always have the
option

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we take that very seriously so yes
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions on
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.310 align:start position:0%
testify
on

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh i was just curious uh on part one
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone present from
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
health and human services who cared to
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
if there is please raise your hand if
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus would you be
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
able to answer your question
 
00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
able to answer your question
probably

00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
um i didn't actually
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't actually have a hand
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't actually have a question
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
it just seemed
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
serious with so many of that
 
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.589 align:start position:0%
serious with so many of that
department's

00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
department's
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
positions involved that no one was here
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to us
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
from that specific department
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think i can actually explain that if
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
it would help um
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
the process is is fairly standardized
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
and has been sort of ongoing with jcdc
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
over some time
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um hhs has the most unclassified
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
positions in the state in part because
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
of a reorganization done 25 years ago
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
where they created a
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
senior executive service the so-called
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
terry morton positions
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's a very recent thing where where
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
was insistent on uh jcec
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
insisted in a good way on on getting
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
them to re-evaluate all the positions
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
the positions all the unclassified
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
positions in the state were evaluated in
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
2001 when we created the new grid
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
unclassified grid classified grid um and
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of adjusting them
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
where um over time they've reached the
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
point where the working title for our
 
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.230 align:start position:0%
point where the working title for our
position

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the actual title for position were
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
radically divergent from each other
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a this is a significant
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
cleanup process and so
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
it it looks remarkable to this committee
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
when they look at the piece of
 
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.230 align:start position:0%
when they look at the piece of
legislation

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
but i think for the
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the joint committee itself um it's a
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's something that's happening and they
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
understand it and they're and they're
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
prepared for it so so i think you know
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
hhs would not look at it you know i'm
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
here to talk about the amendment that
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeking um because it's it's
 
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.829 align:start position:0%
we're seeking um because it's it's
different

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i think hhs is probably not here to
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
talk about it because they think it's
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
um standard order of business if that
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
makes any sense
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative schuett you may
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
remember that we get a bill from the
 
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.870 align:start position:0%
remember that we get a bill from the
jcec

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
jcec
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much every year
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
and the departments involved are almost
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
never there to speak on the positions
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's only the jcec that's there to
 
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.910 align:start position:0%
it's only the jcec that's there to
testify

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i thank you commissioner i
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that explanation
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you man chair so uh commissioner
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh you may be aware of although it was
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
done under one of your predecessors
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
there was a study commission uh uh
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
chaired by senator carson who just left
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
the meeting so
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
i was hoping she would still be here
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
that study commission on which i served
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
with senator former senator forrester
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
and shared by senator carson that looked
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
at our bidding process
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
our contract process pretty thoroughly
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we had a lot of you know a lot of
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
buy-in if you will from contractors uh
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
is it time for another
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
review or do you think that the process
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
is working pretty well because it is a
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
complex and delicate
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
operation as you've alluded to
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
so there was uh i think the commission
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
that representative schmidt refers to
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
happened in or around 2015 it was before
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
my time but it was i think it was when
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the theorem was here
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
um senator carson has been involved with
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
procurement for a very long time
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
it was at that time that statutory
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
changes were made to 21g
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
um rsa21g in that section that involves
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
the procurement process what information
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
is released to the public it's sort of
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
why we're here um
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that a commission
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
commission is entitled that
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is as a result of that there is a
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
standing uh meeting on occasion when
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
needed uh procurement committee that
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
meets which i think senator carson is
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
currently the chair of and it involves
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
various members which we talked to
 
00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:52.790 align:start position:0%
various members which we talked to
periodically

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
um reverse auctions is a thing that
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
but can be dealt with um uh
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
on its own you know gary and his team
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
and you can tell how knowledgeable gary
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
is about
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
about procurement both from from uh his
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh his previous jobs and went to state
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
um but gary and his team and they meet
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
with them takamino rakhmatova is the
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
is the attorney of the attorney
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
general's office is the procurement
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
attorney currently
 
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.349 align:start position:0%
attorney currently
um

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
and uh you know they meet and they look
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
at anything that needs tweaking and
 
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.310 align:start position:0%
at anything that needs tweaking and
changing

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
part of that comes up as a result of the
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
process gary talked about where we look
 
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
process gary talked about where we look
at

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
at
um

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know every time we do any kind of a
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's reverse auction or a
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
regular procurement you you do some kind
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
of a post-mortem on it and say is that
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
working well or do you think that's
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
something that's a candidate for doing
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
it this way instead of this way and um
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and so those things are happening i
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
think right now we're okay without a
 
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
think right now we're okay without a
commission

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
but i would say that that
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
senator carson's committee
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
um is a very valuable that sort of
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
standing procurement committee
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
is a very valuable piece of
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state and i would
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the commission i was alluding to was i
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
did a lot of work we had we got re-upped
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
actually from one
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
term to the next because it was doing so
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
much important work and we got the
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit in the first go-around
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
and the the renewal the commission uh
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
got most of the experience
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's not really relevant to this
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
well that but we have the commitment
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
you've been answered your questions been
 
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
you've been answered your questions been
answered

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
well i'm just saying that it seems to me
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
like that the
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that was devised uh
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
was effective and he's just alluded to
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
that so uh i'm i'm glad to hear that
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you

arlinghaus
and

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
i'd like
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say about it and i
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
asked him to
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
i spoke to representative mcguire and
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
senator reagan
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
um about this and this concerns the the
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions or senior
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
leadership of the department of
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
administrative services this is
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
something you know we've been doing
 
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.470 align:start position:0%
something you know we've been doing
internally

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
internally
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh reviewing our process and all that
 
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
uh reviewing our process and all that
um

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
we we're not standardized so people
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
probably know this
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
that there are there are more than 10
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
000 state employees who are full-time
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
97 98 of them are are are classified
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
employees they're in that classification
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
grid and they're hourly employees so for
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
example i have
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
an accountant who makes a hundred and
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand dollars a year who's
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
an hourly employee and can't work a 38th
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
hour in a week
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
um because it's the it's the way the
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
system works it's probably not
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the exam non-exempt
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
rules in in our so commissioners and
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
directors generally and some of the
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
senior leadership positions are
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
unclassified which is a which is a
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
separate system and a separate grid and
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's the grid controlled by the jcec
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
which is why i've asked for this to be
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
appended to this bill
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
in our area we have some division
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
directors who are classified and some
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
are unclassified most are unclassified
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they should be and we've been
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
converting positions one here and one
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
there here up periodically where you
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
where you know four or five years ago we
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
did risk and benefits that that position
 
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
did risk and benefits that that position
became

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh when cassie was
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
behind me um was was director there she
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
became unclassified
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
um we converted the director plant
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
property last year
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is a bill to clean all of this up
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
um tom karen the room with me drafted
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
the bill for us
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
um in the best traditions of the statute
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and it does two things one
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
one it takes an it takes an additional i
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
think it's 11 positions and makes them
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
unclassified instead of classified these
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
are all the highest paid senior
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
positions in the department
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
and it essentially turns them into what
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
that means is turns them from an hourly
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
into a salaried employee
 
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.510 align:start position:0%
into a salaried employee
um

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um it does that for
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
commissioners obviously already there
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
all the directors and then deputy
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
directors and analogous positions to
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
deputy directors for example we have an
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
internal auditor we have a senior
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
operational analyst we have a chief
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
financial officer the fact that my chief
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
financial officer
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
is currently an hourly employee
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
suggests something about how
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
slightly anachronistic the system
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
is currently so would take these
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
positions and it would make them
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
unclassified it would further divide
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
them in a standardized way directors and
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
commissioners would be appointed for a
 
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.190 align:start position:0%
commissioners would be appointed for a
term

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
as they as they are mostly today and
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
then that's how it is pretty much across
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
state government they are appointed for
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
a term let's say if let's say a four
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
year term my case that happens before
 
00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
year term my case that happens before
your

00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
gary's case it happens to be a four-year
 
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.470 align:start position:0%
gary's case it happens to be a four-year
term

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
um a governor council appointment there
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
are other positions in
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
in government who are appointed at it
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
was referred to as pleasure of the
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner which just means they serve
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
like a like a regular employee in any
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
job does
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um they don't have a term when their
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
employment expires they just they serve
 
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
employment expires they just they serve
um

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
and you can't just you can't just
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate them willy-nilly um i couldn't
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
go i don't like your tie go away
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
but they serve it the pleasure of the
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner it's it's like a job
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
um and so what we did is to divide them
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
into two groups directors and
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
commissioners have a term
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
and everybody below the director level
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is to say deputies internal auditor
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
has a pleasure of the commission return
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
this is the structure we have in other
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
positions today for example the deputy
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
director of risk and benefits
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
is pleasure the commissioner
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
today the director of risk and benefits
 
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.790 align:start position:0%
today the director of risk and benefits
is

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
a four-year term
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so this does that it is a longer it
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
is a lot of words
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
is a lot of words
um

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
but that's what it does and it's a lot
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
of words because
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
it changes the statutory reference to
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
administrator of this to
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
um to director of this and all of that
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
and it it cleans the statute up so that
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
everything matches and there's no an
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
anachronistic uh referral to something
 
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.109 align:start position:0%
anachronistic uh referral to something
else

00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot simpler than it looks and
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process we would have
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
approximately five percent of the
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
departments 444
 
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.109 align:start position:0%
departments 444
authorized

00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time positions
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
95 would be classified 5 would be
 
00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:49.670 align:start position:0%
95 would be classified 5 would be
unclassified

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer questions about
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
if anything looks you think it's screwy
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
or the whole thing sounds weird to you
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
mr arlingham this sounds like a
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
i mean for our department it is
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
but if we don't if we don't do it in
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
statute we can't do it
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's point earlier i remember who
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
made this point maybe it was you made
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
with somebody else about this has to be
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm impressed there are no other
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
can we see that i don't have that
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
amendment am i supposed to have that
 
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
amendment am i supposed to have that
amendment

00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
it was sent out this morning
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
this morning okay i'll go look for it

thank you
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think we will need to have a
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
if you have any additional questions and
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%

which is pretty easy to figure out
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
charles.m.r house at gas but um

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner we've dug up a
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
few questions representative bailey
 
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.990 align:start position:0%
few questions representative bailey
hi

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
the original 104
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
fna had a part
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note that mentions a part
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
three which is not in it deleted by the
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
senate okay so then this amendment has
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
nothing to do that adds a part three has
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
totally new different unique parts right
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
just a general question i haven't looked
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
over all of this in detail i kind of
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
skimmed it but uh
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
it has in statute things like the first
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
page on line 14 the commissioner shall
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
nominate my appointment
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
for appointment by the governor et
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
cetera um is there anything in here that
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes um the term or anything else
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
about any of the
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
appointed positions other than whether
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're classified or not classified
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um the the only there are two ver
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
they're two very slight changes we have
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
an education and training officer
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
um who is a uh
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
functionally a bureau chief of the
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
division of personnel for the bureau of
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
education and training and we have a um
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
senior operational analyst which is a
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
which is an analytical position
 
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.349 align:start position:0%
which is an analytical position
um

00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
for for analyzing government you could
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
think of it as
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
vaguely budget related
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
those positions currently serve a term
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
but because under this schematic they
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
would not uh they would become serving
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the pleasure of however because each
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
of those positions has someone in them
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's a paragraph in it which says
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
that the um they will serve up their
 
00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:18.790 align:start position:0%
that the um they will serve up their
term

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
because you can't change that and um uh
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
the next person or their next term they
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
would they would convert to the to the
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
new system but other than that there are
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
no changes to people's terms
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
yes those are
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing and i believe
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
this will go to representative pearson's
 
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
this will go to representative pearson's
subcommittee

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.470 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
because

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:38.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
since representative pearson is not here
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
not yet 11
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
so representative broda
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
you have a motion for us
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 15
 
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.589 align:start position:0%
senate bill 15
yes

00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.790 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
i move
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment on senate bill
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none represent if you could
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh report in the next day or so i

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
i will madam chair
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
um could i also comment that
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
we had agreed as a committee that we
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
would adopt
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
the um building codes
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
three years after they were
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
implemented and so
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
it would be time next year to adopt the
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.390 align:start position:0%
it would be time next year to adopt the
2018

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
building code would that be correct
 
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
building code would that be correct
correct

01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
yes and i believe the building code
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
review board has moved on to considering
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
amendments to the
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
2018 code so they're adopted in fullness
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
and i expect that one of us will be
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
approached to bring such a bill in for
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
i want to pass with amendment
 
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.829 align:start position:0%
i want to pass with amendment
1105

01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
1105
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:05.109 align:start position:0%
madam chair
yes

01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
i i believe we did vote on that bill
 
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
i i believe we did vote on that bill
previously

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
do we not have to revisit that vote
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
before we can amend it
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct representative
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
in that case i move to reconsider the
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by i believe
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
no no is that who is representative roy
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the reason we're reconsidering it is so
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
change the
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
passed this bill we point we realized
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
that it needed
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
additional work and that's what that's
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
what that amendment does
 
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
what that amendment does
so

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
if we would like to to consider the
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
amendment we should vote in favor of
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
reconsideration if you just want to get
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
it out of our hair we can
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
vote against reconsideration
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
so any discussion representative
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
can you please refresh my memory what is
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
it that we're changing in the bill
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
what's specifically about the commission
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm drawing a blank here we're
 
01:05:36.319 --> 01:05:37.589 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm drawing a blank here we're
adding

01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're adding the duties that they shall
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
process for the adoption of new editions
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%

will include consideration of
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a permanent statutory
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
committee for that purpose
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%

01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%

pass
that

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
would the statutory committee
 
01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:15.430 align:start position:0%
would the statutory committee
supersede

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
supersede
 
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
supersede
the

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
legislation of the building codes the
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
adoption by legislation of the building
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
codes or where they come to the to the
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
edna with a recommendation
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
we're just saying they should look
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
really hard how we adopt
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
building codes and building code updates
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
because the current method is
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
let's just say it's inefficient
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're getting way off the topic
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
here the motion is reconsideration
 
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
here the motion is reconsideration
correct

01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
but the reason for reconsideration is to
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
so it sounds totally support that
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
most people have
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
have appear to have read the amendment
 
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
have appear to have read the amendment
so

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.110 align:start position:0%
so
yes

01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%

so we have my
 
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.229 align:start position:0%
so we have my
reconsideration

01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
reconsideration

fine so we are now reconsidering our
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
vote of what to pass
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
on senate bill
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
106. and
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it now would be relevant
 
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
i believe it now would be relevant
to

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
would it be relevant to just move
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment since we have
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
not to pass
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%

parliamentarian

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i move amendment 1105
 
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
and i move amendment 1105
h

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative roy beat me to it
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i will say that this expands the
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
duties of the commission to address the
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised at the
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
previous executive session
 
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.270 align:start position:0%
previous executive session
because

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we look at
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
this process again
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's important
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative roy do you wish to speak
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
no that's okay i think he said it
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
i see in the amendment that calls for
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
three senators
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing they have agreement to that
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
number as we know sometimes it's
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to get
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
senators to attend such commissions we
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely do have agreement
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative schuett that's the bill
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that came to us from the senate
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
and i know that senator morris has been
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
vigilant about making sure that at least
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the number of senators are required for
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
any study committee to vote for
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to be sure that
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
they were aware that
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment was coming to us we're
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
just agreeing with representative
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
when you introduced it you said it
 
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:01.830 align:start position:0%
when you introduced it you said it
expanded

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the duties of the commission i mean what
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee oh
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
so basically this
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
this whole process and um you know all
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
they would do is uh
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
report their findings i recommend
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislation if they think there needs to
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
be which would then come to zulita in
 
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.149 align:start position:0%
be which would then come to zulita in
dna

01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
dna
 
01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
dna
the

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the senators when they brought
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
brought this to us was that this year
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
the committee would
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
work with the building code review board
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
to develop a bill to adopt the 18
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
version of the codes
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
and while they're at it they'd figure
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
out a better way to do it
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%

01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
i have a motion on senate bill 33
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
which is relative to native american
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
name restoration
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to move in expedient to
 
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.550 align:start position:0%

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
who was before him
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
no terry was before me
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay i'll give you credit this time it's
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill came to us as amended by
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
the senate the sponsor brought in a new
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to the hearing
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then all the people that
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
are claimed to be involved spoke in
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i've got to say it is not ready for
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
prime time by any means
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that the
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders need to get together and
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
agree if any changes need to be made
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure they are needed we do have
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
a process
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm recommending you just
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt do you wish to
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
speak to your second well i certainly
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
will second the remarks you just made uh
 
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
will second the remarks you just made uh
and

01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
for me the most important thing here is
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
to have the buy-in of the indigenous
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire of whom i'm
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
recently informed there are maybe as
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
many as ten thousand abundantly in new
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now um
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.709 align:start position:0%
there is
uh

01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the commission
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
itself is
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
is in some doubt with regard to
 
01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:20.709 align:start position:0%
is in some doubt with regard to
uh

01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
the position they have and they're not a
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
majority on the commission of abunaki
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
and this is something where
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh they their voice needs to be heard
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
and they are still developing even the
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
people i've been speaking with are still
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
developing their position on renaming of
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
things and so forth so
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
your earlier remark about
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
getting them to have a unified position
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
is absolutely on on point so high tl is
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
the right way to go here
 
01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
the right way to go here
representative

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes and i will agree with what's been
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
said this far and as i understand it the
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
renaming process
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
as it exists today actually isn't
 
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.669 align:start position:0%
as it exists today actually isn't
working

01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
and why fix something that isn't broken
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
excellent representative schuett
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i am
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just echoing what's been
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
said already
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
i was going to originally
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
suggest retention of this bill but my
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
question would be
if

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
through some miracle
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
they come up with an agreement for a
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill for next year
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel that killing this bill in
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
any way would
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
it might
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
past the senate so
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
they could introduce it through the
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
senate i believe
 
01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:58.870 align:start position:0%
senate i believe
and

01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
i hope it would be different enough that
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
we could accept it in the house
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think it also if they
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
more generically address the process for
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
name changes
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
that would be different enough that they
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
should do it
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would not be in favor of
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
retention only because
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's so there were so many
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant issues with this bill but i
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
really think that that's addressed by
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
the people who are involved and i would
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
be hesitant to think something
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
that as a as representative schultz said
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
is already working so if we have a
 
01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.189 align:start position:0%
is already working so if we have a
system

01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's functional
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
i would be very hesitant to change that
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
all right

03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill at the request of
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill was
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
to enable
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
the governor to
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
end some of the emergency orders
 
03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:14.790 align:start position:0%
end some of the emergency orders
by

03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
placing into statute some of the
 
03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:18.389 align:start position:0%
placing into statute some of the
provisions

03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
03:00:18.399 --> 03:00:19.510 align:start position:0%
provisions
of

03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic initiatives
 
03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:24.389 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic initiatives
that

03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
could go into statute enabling the
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
ending of some of the emergency orders
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
this bill was much longer when it was
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
first introduced and the senate winnowed
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
it down to
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
the nine provisions that are in the bill
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that um even though there
 
03:00:45.349 --> 03:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
was quite a bit of controversy
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
initially about this bill that
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
controversy has largely been dissipated
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
because of what's in the bill and i'll
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
just very briefly touch on
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know those provisions that are in
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bill the first section
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
deals with the nurse practice act and it
 
03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:04.150 align:start position:0%
deals with the nurse practice act and it
allows

03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
allows
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities
 
03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities
um

03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
to create the position of a temporary
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
health partner
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%

senator
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
could we ask questions of each section
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
because i they don't appear to be very
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
much related
 
03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:24.150 align:start position:0%
much related

do

03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you in that case this
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
this is to be a permanent new level of
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%

03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%

i this position i think if you look at
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
line 18 of the bill it's designed to
 
03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:06.070 align:start position:0%

03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%

made it
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%

03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
utilize a non-conforming use for
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
a period of a year you could lose that
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
status this allows the protection for

status this allows the protection for
pre-existing

03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
pre-existing
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
non-conforming uses for summer camps i
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a very important
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
provision for
 
03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
summer camps throughout new hampshire
 
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
um section eight
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
this was um
 
03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
put into the bill by the senate because
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the difficulty sometimes of
 
03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:57.190 align:start position:0%
of the difficulty sometimes of
completing

03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
completing
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
um construction work uh for
 
03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:02.550 align:start position:0%
um construction work uh for
um

03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
on a permit to make sure that um
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
those permits move forward
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
and don't just expire because of covid
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:06:13.359 --> 03:06:14.790 align:start position:0%
and then
lastly

03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
section nine
 
03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
section nine
um

03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
is a temporary expansion of outdoor
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
dining through 2023.
 
03:06:24.399 --> 03:06:25.349 align:start position:0%
dining through 2023.
so

03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
that was something that um i think most
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
people would agree in new hampshire has
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.870 --> 03:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
03:06:37.030 --> 03:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
determined that it should be expanded
 
03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
that period of two years and then
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
analyze it again and as you can see
 
03:06:47.190 --> 03:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
um in the section 10 that section is
 
03:06:47.200 --> 03:06:48.630 align:start position:0%
um in the section 10 that section is
repealed

um at the end of 2023
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:06:53.279 --> 03:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
and then
uh

03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:54.160 --> 03:06:55.330 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
03:07:01.359 --> 03:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
uh

03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%

03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%

bradley for taking my question uh my
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
question is it just quickly involves
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
just section 8 when it comes to school
 
03:07:33.910 --> 03:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
bus lights
 
03:07:36.389 --> 03:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
um just to be sure for clarification
 
03:07:39.269 --> 03:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is just adding a provision
 
03:07:42.070 --> 03:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
to go along with the existing rsa 266
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't removing anything
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
as far as the school bus lights and the
 
03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
as far as the school bus lights and the
requirements

03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%

senate

03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%

we did take some of them out
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
and ended up with the nine provisions

uh thank you i'm sure so this may just
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
be that i'm not familiar with the way i
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
haven't seen before how this is put
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
together but it's around uh
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
prospective repeals and the effective
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
i mean the way i read it under effective
 
03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:12.309 align:start position:0%
i mean the way i read it under effective
dates

03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
dates
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's paragraphs one and two of section
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
10 of section 10. i see
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:28.840 align:start position:0%

03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
senator bradley is there anything in the

restaurant outdoor dining area
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
that would overrule current town
 
03:09:40.479 --> 03:09:51.429 align:start position:0%
that would overrule current town
ordinances

03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just reading it
 
03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
i'm just reading it
um

03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
i i you know i suspect the municipal
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
association is going to testify that's
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably i don't see anything that
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
overrules the town zoning but that would
 
03:10:13.590 --> 03:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
be a better question to ask
 
03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal association
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:22.230 align:start position:0%

03:10:22.230 --> 03:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.950 --> 03:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um senator bradley
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about section
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
eight i think i think it is the um
 
03:10:34.469 --> 03:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
the one about the construction
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
why

03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is needed because i would think
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
that at this point
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
that most of the municipalities
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
have been able to
 
03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:48.990 align:start position:0%
start to
 
03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:50.469 align:start position:0%
start to
[Music]

03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
address building permits
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
so why do you believe this is still
 
03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
so why do you believe this is still
needed

03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
needed
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think this is one of those that um you
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
could be right
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:11:07.590 --> 03:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's safe to
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
say that there are probably some
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
communities where it is necessary and as
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
i recall
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative the testimony in the
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.349 --> 03:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
i have a question about the
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
would the
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
would restricted operations during
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
should we change it to show that
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
restricted use during the summer of 2021
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
does not
 
03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:00.150 --> 03:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:04.389 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.399 --> 03:12:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't know what
 
03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably a question that the
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
association of camp directors could
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer better
 
03:12:17.429 --> 03:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that most camps are
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
going to be able to open in 2021
 
03:12:20.479 --> 03:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
going to be able to open in 2021
um

03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
but it may be wise to say summer of 2020
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
and 2021 i
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'll leave that up to your discretion
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative

administration of covert vaccines
 
03:12:49.269 --> 03:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm looking under
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
318 and
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
um currently on the
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
318-16b pharmacist administration of
 
03:12:57.120 --> 03:12:58.389 align:start position:0%
318-16b pharmacist administration of
vaccines

03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
currently includes the administration of
 
03:13:03.190 --> 03:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
covert 19 vaccines and i'm just curious
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
as to why there's a whole new section
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
going creating 318 colon 16f when
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are already allowed to
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
administer i'm trying to
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
um you got me on that one
 
03:13:27.439 --> 03:13:30.469 align:start position:0%
um you got me on that one
again

03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.309 --> 03:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
we've expanded the
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
the point was to it to allow the
 
03:13:39.990 --> 03:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
administer the vaccine
 
03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:45.269 align:start position:0%
administer the vaccine
and

03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.279 --> 03:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
think section 4 deals with a pharmacist
 
03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:53.269 align:start position:0%
think section 4 deals with a pharmacist
and

03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:56.790 --> 03:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
section 5 deals with the technician
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
they maybe just covered slightly
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
differently in the statute so they
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be cited one for the
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
technician and one for the pharmacist
 
03:14:08.399 --> 03:14:09.190 align:start position:0%
technician and one for the pharmacist
but

03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps somebody who has more expertise
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
than i can answer that
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:17.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm looking at 318-16b and it deals
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
with a pharmacist or pharmacy intern
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
whereas section 5 of the bill
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
deals with pharmacy technicians so i
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
guess it expands into pharmacy
 
03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
guess it expands into pharmacy
technicians

03:14:32.790 --> 03:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions for uh senator
 
03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:39.670 align:start position:0%
any further questions for uh senator
bradley

03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
this will be going to subcommittee
 
03:14:42.399 --> 03:14:43.830 align:start position:0%
this will be going to subcommittee
um

03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative roy seems the most
 
03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:47.269 align:start position:0%
representative roy seems the most
appropriate

03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:14:47.279 --> 03:14:51.429 align:start position:0%
appropriate
so

03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%

03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill so much as it is with the amended
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill that gives gives that case
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
mr schmidt we are not discussing that
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment at the moment we will be
 
03:15:59.429 --> 03:15:59.439 align:start position:0%

03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record lindsay
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
courtney executive director of the new
 
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire office of professional
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
oplc wishes to express its support of
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
portions of this bill directly impacting
 
03:17:00.469 --> 03:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
oplc specifically sections two
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
um when the covid19 pandemic began
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers uh quickly moved to
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
a telehealth platform in order to
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
prevent and limit the spread of the
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
virus this of course legally posed a
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
challenge for the state the practice of
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
health care is deemed to occur where
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
their patient is physically located
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
so providers who typically provided care
 
03:17:23.910 --> 03:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire patients and border
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
states such as vermont and massachusetts
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
suddenly needed a new hampshire license
 
03:17:29.910 --> 03:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to legally provide services
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
to those patients
 
03:17:33.030 --> 03:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
and to receive reimbursement from
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
insurance providers for those services
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
emergency order number 15 authorizes the
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
agency to issue emergency licenses to
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
medical providers who have a license in
 
03:17:45.190 --> 03:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
good standing in another jurisdiction
 
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
rather than grant the authority to issue
 
03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
licenses to individual boards this
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
consolidated approach permitted the
 
03:17:53.429 --> 03:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
agency to issue licenses quickly using
 
03:17:55.750 --> 03:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
one simplified process
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
at present our time frame for complete
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
application to licensure is 24 business
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
hours or less
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
and today the agency has issued
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 222 thousand emergency
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
license without a fee
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
63 percent of psychologists in new
 
03:18:14.070 --> 03:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire 47 of marriage and family
 
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
therapists 45 percent of active licensed
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health workers and 45
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent of licensed independent clinical
 
03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
social workers in new hampshire are
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
practicing with an emergency license
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
issued by the agency
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
oplc has encouraged these providers with
 
03:18:32.710 --> 03:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
an emergency license to obtain permanent
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensure if they intend to continue to
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
practice in this state
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
but one of the most frequent questions
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
we receive is how long the license will
 
03:18:40.399 --> 03:18:41.269 align:start position:0%
we receive is how long the license will
last

03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
at present the emergency order is tied
 
03:18:45.269 --> 03:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
to the state of emergency which must be
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
reevaluated every 21 days
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
codifying the office's ability to issue
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
these licenses through january 31st of
 
03:18:54.309 --> 03:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
next year would provide professionals
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
and facilities with predictability
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
as to the licensed term
 
03:18:58.880 --> 03:18:59.670 align:start position:0%
as to the licensed term
and

03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that new hampshire
 
03:19:03.030 --> 03:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
constituents continue to have access to
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
the care they need oplc fully supports
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
section three as mentioned permits
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
with certain training to administer the
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
covenant vaccines and tests
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
obviously it goes without saying that
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
our pharmacists and pharmacy techs are
 
03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
trusted partners in the state's effort
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
to quickly and effectively combat cobit
 
03:19:22.319 --> 03:19:23.670 align:start position:0%
to quickly and effectively combat cobit
19

03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
19
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
accordingly oplc urges your support of
 
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
section 3.
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
and section 4 permits out-of-state
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacies to ship investigational drugs
 
03:19:33.510 --> 03:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
to clinical trial participants who
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
reside in new hampshire and who are
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
unable to to retrieve the
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs from out of state
 
03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:40.150 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs from out of state
pharmacies

03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
this emergency order essentially rose
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
because there are several new hampshire
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
patients who typically travel to
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts hospitals for
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
participation in clinical trials where
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
they receive investigational drugs such
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
as dana farmer
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
when the transition to telehealth
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
platform occurred massachusetts
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities were seeking to
 
03:19:59.190 --> 03:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
continue to provide such drugs to their
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
patients located in the future in order
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure the continuity of care for
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
this vulnerable and limited population
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
oplc believes this emergency order must
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
continue during the copa 19 pandemic
 
03:20:12.389 --> 03:20:12.399 align:start position:0%

i guess the question gets into
[Music]

03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
the definition of um
 
03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
limiting this to investigational drugs i
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
mean i have a
 
03:21:17.590 --> 03:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
personal situation where i get uh
 
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
specialty eye drops for dry eye that
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%

03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i had to travel down there quarterly
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
to have that done
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
which posed a problem i was able to find
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
someplace up here that did it
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know i guess the question is what's
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs because there are
 
03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
some drugs that are made
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh specifically for a person in
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
particular those drops are made out of
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
my own blood so i can't get them as a
 
03:21:44.479 --> 03:21:45.510 align:start position:0%
my own blood so i can't get them as a
general

03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know from a normal pharmacy
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
and would those be covered and if not
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know why not
 
03:21:53.910 --> 03:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that definition would have
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
to be fleshed out in in rulemaking um i
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
do think that the situation you posed um
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
would meet that test of being an
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
investigational drug typically i think
 
03:22:06.150 --> 03:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
the way we've looked at it throughout
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
the emergency
 
03:22:09.190 --> 03:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency is that if it's
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
if it's a drug that's um
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
essentially made for a particular
 
03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
essentially made for a particular
patient

03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
um that's not necessarily goes through
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
the fda approval process that usually
 
03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
meets the definition of um
 
03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:22.309 align:start position:0%
meets the definition of um
in

03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
an investigational drug but i do think
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
that that would need further
 
03:22:25.279 --> 03:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
that that would need further
clarification

03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know encompassing all types of
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
scenarios the common situation that this
 
03:22:35.190 --> 03:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
has posed is really um cancer patients
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
or people undergoing clinical trials
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
that have that were typically going down
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
to boston for their services um and then
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
the move to the telehealth platform that
 
03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
that was the most common scenario that
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
we that we encountered throughout the
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative phillips
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:23:00.080 --> 03:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
director courtney
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh could you please
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
tell me about section one
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
because section one doesn't have an
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
expired date
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
in these temporary health partners
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking are not going to be
 
03:23:20.309 --> 03:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
temporary anymore
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
duties that are close to what an lna
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
has and there doesn't seem to be any
 
03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
your agency would
 
03:23:39.269 --> 03:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
know who these people are
 
03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
and and i'm also just wondering how
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
how they would be classified in terms of
 
03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:46.630 align:start position:0%
how they would be classified in terms of
in

03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know what category of employee
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
because i'm thinking that
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
the long-term care facilities i assume
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're reporting to somebody how
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
they're about their staffing and how
 
03:23:57.359 --> 03:23:58.389 align:start position:0%
they're about their staffing and how
many

03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
rns and they have in lpns and all of
 
03:24:01.520 --> 03:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
rns and they have in lpns and all of
this

03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
any insight you have on that i'd
 
03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:05.349 align:start position:0%
any insight you have on that i'd
appreciate

03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
um the emergency order pertaining to
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
temporary health partners was the result
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
of much collaboration with stakeholders
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
including the agency and the board of
 
03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:16.630 align:start position:0%
including the agency and the board of
nursing

03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
nursing
um

03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
so typically so new hampshire state of
 
03:24:23.190 --> 03:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licenses lnas other states
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
have certified nursing assistants others
 
03:24:25.279 --> 03:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
have certified nursing assistants others
have

03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
just basically anybody who meets their
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
criteria and it's approved by a board of
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
nursing in order for cms to reimburse
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities for the
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
services at minimum um the lna or cna or
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
whoever is functioning in that capacity
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
requires um an eight hour course some
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
states have taken the approach that an
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
eight-hour course is sufficient to be an
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
lna or a cna new hampshire has taken the
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
position i think rightfully so that to
 
03:24:58.389 --> 03:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
be an lna um you need a hundred hours
 
03:25:00.630 --> 03:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
which is really not a lot of time
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
so um there was a lot of discussion
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the emergency um the state of
 
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
emergency particularly at the beginning
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
of that how do we get more
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers into our long-term
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions were raised about whether or
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
not we lowered the existing standard for
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
an lna to eight hours from 100 hours to
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
eight hours i can tell you that a lot of
 
03:25:20.960 --> 03:25:22.389 align:start position:0%
eight hours i can tell you that a lot of
stakeholders

03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing included thought
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
that that was not protective of the
 
03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
that that was not protective of the
public

03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:27.510 align:start position:0%
public
um

03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the um a lot of the complaints
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
we received currently um are
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
disproportionately uh related to lna
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
care and so the the thought was that by
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing standards we could increase
 
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
um potential harm to patient care
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
so when um stakeholders collaborated
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
regarding the temporary health partner
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
it was clear that this temporary health
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
partner should should not be functioning
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
as an lna but they should be assisting
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
um the lna
 
03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
and um and with that language in place
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
the board and the agency were able to be
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe the department although i
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for dhhs we're able
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
to be supportive of that language
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so this really codifies that um
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
that collaborative effort and allows um
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
people without the lna training to
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
to enter the workforce in a long-term
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
care facility but they're not permitted
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
to function
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
um as an lna outside of going through
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
the lna application process
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
i believe there is some legislation
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
pending that would um that would permit
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
one to essentially utilize their
 
03:26:36.479 --> 03:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
one to essentially utilize their
experience

03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:26:41.110 --> 03:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
as a temporary health partner as a
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism to transition to lna
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
that was something that the board of
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
nursing did support and the office does
 
03:26:51.190 --> 03:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
support as well provided that um that
 
03:26:54.150 --> 03:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
they do meet the minimum qualifications
 
03:26:56.790 --> 03:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
although it's important to note that cms
 
03:26:56.800 --> 03:26:58.229 align:start position:0%
although it's important to note that cms
regulations

03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
do require for reimbursement purposes
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
that this um
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
that an lna
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
attend a board approved program so when
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're drafting that sort of legislation
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
you need to make clear that um
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
that whatever education or experience
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
this temporary health partner has
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
um needs to be board approved i think
 
03:27:20.469 --> 03:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
that kind of goes above that kind of
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
goes outside the scope of what you're
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
asking for but um that's that's the
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
background behind this temporary health
 
03:27:26.319 --> 03:27:31.349 align:start position:0%
background behind this temporary health
partner

03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly the kind of
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
thing i'm looking for i'm just wondering
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
if you have any insight
 
03:27:38.319 --> 03:27:39.269 align:start position:0%
if you have any insight
into

03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where this is in statute
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that temporary
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so this would this would amend 326
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
was that which is the board of nursing
 
03:27:57.429 --> 03:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
practice act um
 
03:27:57.439 --> 03:27:58.309 align:start position:0%
practice act um
and

03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i would agree with you if it's i guess
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
it is temporary i should throw it out
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
there it is temporary to the extent that
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
per cms regulations
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
i hold on i don't want to overspeak
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
if they are functioning as an lna which
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
they are not so never mind i'm i'm just
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:21.359 --> 03:28:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
licensure of temporary health
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
partners to lnas is covered under one of
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
the sections of senate bill 133 it will
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
be in subcommittee tomorrow
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows if you want to
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.239 --> 03:28:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
first

03:28:51.349 --> 03:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
are you here testifying on behalf of the
 
03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
office of oplc or
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
both the office and the board of
 
03:28:57.279 --> 03:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
both the office and the board of
pharmacy

03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:01.920 --> 03:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
okay
and

03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:06.150 align:start position:0%
and
follow

03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:08.550 align:start position:0%
follow
um

03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
confirm that the boards are acting
 
03:29:13.590 --> 03:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
independently of the office when they
 
03:29:16.389 --> 03:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
make the decisions they are making
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it depends on what the
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
decision is but yeah they have their own
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory authority
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
all right because that just the concern
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
i heard about your testimony was
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
if the board and the office both agree
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
on a change and my concern is what
 
03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
happens if you disagree
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
i don't recall that part of my testimony
 
03:29:38.229 --> 03:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative could you clarify just so
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
that i can clarify
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
there was something that just came up
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
and you stated that the board of nursing
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:51.190 --> 03:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
yeah which is why i made that
 
03:29:53.190 --> 03:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
distinction that both the board and the
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
office supported because i worked very
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
closely with the board of nursing on
 
03:29:58.469 --> 03:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
this issue and i can represent that the
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
um miss courtney last week we did hear
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
house bill 133
 
03:30:12.479 --> 03:30:13.590 align:start position:0%
house bill 133
and

03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:15.670 --> 03:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
which was actually which was to include
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
the the hours that people were working
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
towards the 100 hours
 
03:30:24.309 --> 03:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
because at the time we didn't have
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
enough lnas
 
03:30:31.510 --> 03:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
so now what we're asking to do is we're
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're creating
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
this position of temporary health care
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
partner health partner
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
and this person
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
would work so what would this this
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
person would work under
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
was would this be somebody who's
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
no um this person works alongside an lna
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
and assess the lna um when we were
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
working with stakeholders to come up
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
with this language that was one thing
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
that the office dhhs and um the board of
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
nursing wanted to make clear that this
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
person wasn't functioning as an lna um
 
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
because they had only
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
they will on day one only have taken an
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
eight-hour course that doesn't include
 
03:31:19.269 --> 03:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
hands-on clinical experience
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
would that fall under the jurisdiction
 
03:31:29.439 --> 03:31:30.389 align:start position:0%
would that fall under the jurisdiction
of

03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
the bill house bill 133 whereas if they
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
worked for the 100 hours then they would
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
so if both bills were to pass then yes
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
theoretically one could be a temporary
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
health partner and work for 100 hours i
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
believe and then if if that language
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
permitted it um they could transition to
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
a licensed nursing assistant and i i'm
 
03:31:58.150 --> 03:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
planning on talking or hopefully
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
speaking in subcommittee tomorrow
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this and the the only caveat
 
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
is that that language and sb 133 must be
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
changed in order to allow medicaid
 
03:32:10.229 --> 03:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for those individuals um
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
such that you know 100 hours is deemed
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of board approval i can
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
make that um request during the
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but there there is a
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
technical change that that must be
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
made in order to prevent medicaid
 
03:32:22.399 --> 03:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
made in order to prevent medicaid
reimbursement

03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
and how would this part of this bill
 
03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
with the temporary health worker
 
03:32:33.200 --> 03:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
with the temporary health worker
fall

03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
fall
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
be coordinated with house bill 133 that
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
would allow the 100 hours that they do
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
to come towards the l a is that in this
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill or is this
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
how is that going to work
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a separate bill so as i
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand how the two bills would work
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
together if they both passed this bill
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
permits um the the existence of a
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
temporary health partner to continue
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
because right now if you're performing
 
03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
these activities
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
um one can argue that it falls within
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
the scope of the board of nursing so um
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would make clear that one is
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
permitted to perform those activities as
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
long as they have an eight-hour course
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
then they could accrue the hundred hours
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then if there was another statute
 
03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
that permitted them to use those hundred
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
hours to transition to licensure and
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
welcome to your last question
 
03:33:25.359 --> 03:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
welcome to your last question
follow-up

03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you have any do you are there any
 
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
other bills that you know that haven't
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
come to this committee that involves
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
of um licensure with lnas
 
03:33:40.710 --> 03:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge um there is the and
 
03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
i don't i forget off the top of my head
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
but there is a bill that's pending um
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
that would allow emts
 
03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:48.550 align:start position:0%
that would allow emts
and

03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
those with military occupational
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
specialties to obtain permanent license
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a licensure as an lna um and i
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
believe that obviously would come before
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
edna as well but that's something that
 
03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
the office does support
 
03:34:03.279 --> 03:34:04.870 align:start position:0%
the office does support
yes

03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
that particular bill passed the house
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
earlier and is currently in the senate
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct i do remember that
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question miss
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
courtney uh i'm concerned about the new
 
03:34:24.319 --> 03:34:25.429 align:start position:0%
courtney uh i'm concerned about the new
section

03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
that allows it's page 4 line 30
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
pharmacist technicians
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
to administer
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines
 
03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience over the years
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
getting flu shots
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
that i always have to wait
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
to get an appointment to get my flu
 
03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:49.269 align:start position:0%
to get an appointment to get my flu
vaccine

03:34:49.269 --> 03:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
from the practicing pharmacist
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
to me this looks like a pretty major
 
03:34:55.439 --> 03:34:56.950 align:start position:0%
to me this looks like a pretty major
change

03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious what the thinking is uh
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
going forward with
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see this in the repeals
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is consistent with existing
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
emergency orders that are also
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal health and
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
human services guidelines that um that
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
were issued essentially we expanded the
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
ability of certain health care workers
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
um to administer the coven 19 vaccines
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
in order to obviously roll out the
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines quickly um
 
03:35:25.760 --> 03:35:26.469 align:start position:0%
vaccines quickly um
so

03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
pharma pharmacy technicians do presently
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
um have the capability of administering
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
the kobit 19 vaccines under the
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
supervision of a licensed pharmacy and
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
are actually doing that this bill is
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
limited to the copen 19 vaccine um and
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
it still has to be um under the
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
supervision of
 
03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
a licensed pharmacist
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
so um you know oplc supports it to the
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
extent that you know it's clinically
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate i think um i think that the
 
03:35:57.030 --> 03:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:35:59.190 --> 03:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
nationwide we've utilized pharmacy
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
technicians in this capacity to assist
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
with coca-19 demonstrates that in this
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance it is clinically
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do so
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
follow up and chair
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um i understand during the
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh the need for this
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
but we're hearing that
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's likely folks are going to have to
 
03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
it's likely folks are going to have to
get

03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
probably annual boosters of this
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
same as my flu shot
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so this is going to be
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
an exception for what this one specific
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine going forward
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand why it's not
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed at the end of
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully at the end of the pandemic
 
03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
hopefully at the end of the pandemic
period

03:36:45.190 --> 03:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative that's a good question to
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
discuss in the subcommittee
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you manager i had one more
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
question before that i neglected to ask
 
03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:01.670 align:start position:0%
question before that i neglected to ask
um

03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
you had stated that
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
there had been
 
03:37:05.439 --> 03:37:06.150 align:start position:0%
there had been
i

03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
want to say 22 000
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
licenses administered under the
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
and that was at no cost
 
03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
so do you believe that there should be
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of a cost even on a temporary
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
licensure due to the fact that there is
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
a cost overrun associated with the
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
boards processing these and the office
 
03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
processing that number of applications
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
um that this is being passed on to
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
current new hampshire licensees and it's
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
not fair
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
so you raised a good question our
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative i can tell you when we
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
first were
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
working toward emergency licensure we
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
influx of emergency license applications
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of resources yeah we do we
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
have expended great deal of resources
 
03:38:08.469 --> 03:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
just manually processing licenses
 
03:38:08.479 --> 03:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
just manually processing licenses
um

03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:13.349 --> 03:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in 310a that is
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
similar to this that once the state of
 
03:38:17.110 --> 03:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
emergency ends
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
that would allow the office a
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
professional licensure to issue
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses for 120 days based on
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
the same criteria and it is our
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
expectation that we would charge a
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
nominal fee for that um for that
 
03:38:30.309 --> 03:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
temporary license
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
but um given the public health crisis
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we were facing um obviously the
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
agency you know in conjunction with the
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office um and working with
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office you know i
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
i think that it was paramount that we
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
get people in here in order to assist
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and it would be nice hopefully
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
if some of the emergency money that came
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
in would be handed over to the office to
 
03:38:59.670 --> 03:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
help out processing these emergency
 
03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:01.510 align:start position:0%
help out processing these emergency
licenses

03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
we will take that under advisement
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
my my question
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
miss miss courtney um has to do with the
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
the simple pecking order if you will
 
03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
lnas are kind of well they're not kind
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
of they're at the bottom bottom of the
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the uh for the pecking order here and
 
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
and their pay is certainly reflected of
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
that fact uh
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know the pay for lnas is is
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
bluntly horrid so this temporary health
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
care provider that's going to be in
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
essence a new sort of level below an lna
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
what on earth is the expected pay
 
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you would see
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
for this job considering the fact that
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
lnas are barely making by as it is
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for that question to be
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
honest with you i don't know this uh
 
03:39:55.760 --> 03:39:57.429 align:start position:0%
honest with you i don't know this uh
this

03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
emergency order was widely sought out
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
after by the new hampshire healthcare
 
03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
after by the new hampshire healthcare
association

03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
the agency and the board had um
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
some concerns regarding public
 
03:40:07.040 --> 03:40:08.389 align:start position:0%
some concerns regarding public
protection

03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
my general thoughts regarding the um the
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
pay is i think we're never going to see
 
03:40:17.190 --> 03:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers of lnas increase if we don't
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
address the pay situation um oftentimes
 
03:40:21.670 --> 03:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think people view it as a licensure
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
problem it's not a licensure problem um
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
given that the work that they do
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
um you know they get paid at the same
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
rate as you know somebody working at
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
dairy queen on certain you know
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
instances i think that that obviously is
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
a huge part of the problem so i don't
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
know what these temporary health
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
partners are getting paid i i would i
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
think that somebody from you know
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare association or um
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
you know a long-term care facility could
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion then are we just not
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
creating a classification that justify
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
paying people less and less and less and
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
less to do the same work and i know you
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
may not be able to answer that because
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's an opinion question
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean my opinion is that we need
 
03:41:12.790 --> 03:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
to pay lnas more and i think that that
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
the rate of alanis is probably tied to
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
the medicaid reimbursement rate which
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's totally outside my wheelhouse so i
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
think but i think if you want to resolve
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
that problem that's something that the
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
represent bailly
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
miss courtney
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why these first four
 
03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses just couldn't be
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
extended indefinitely
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having a sunset
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have a song oh okay well
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
makes it easier other questions for uh
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%

believe it was on the consent calendar
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh a bill that does exactly what that

of environmental services and i have to
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
first apologize for not being
 
03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
very familiar with this bill it was just
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
a little over an hour ago
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
but i would like to speak to and i'm not
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
sure if this is the time frame or not
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
and if it's not i apologize for that as
 
03:43:55.439 --> 03:43:56.229 align:start position:0%
and if it's not i apologize for that as
well

03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh but we'd like to speak to the
 
03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
expansion of outdoor seating
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
part of this bill is this is this the
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to express a few
 
03:44:04.640 --> 03:44:05.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to express a few
concerns

03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
concerns
yes

03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh again i'm with the subsurface systems
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
bureau i'm the administrator of the
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems bureau and
 
03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:13.910 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems bureau and
the

03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this program is
 
03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:16.870 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this program is
regarding

03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
onsite wastewater or septic systems
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the allowance for the expansion of
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
outdoor seeding
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
could potentially in those
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
in those facilities who who are on
 
03:44:32.950 --> 03:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
on-site waste water
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh versus municipal sewer for instance
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh that could
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh put them in violation of their state
 
03:44:40.720 --> 03:44:41.830 align:start position:0%
uh put them in violation of their state
approvals

03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
approvals
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
for their septic systems
 
03:44:46.150 --> 03:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
at least have those those concerns taken
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration and as i've been
 
03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:54.070 align:start position:0%
into consideration and as i've been
listening

03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that this may be going to
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
sub-committee so
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
if if it's appropriate i can i can
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
attend those subcommittee meetings or i
 
03:45:01.439 --> 03:45:02.309 align:start position:0%
attend those subcommittee meetings or i
can

03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:45:02.319 --> 03:45:03.189 align:start position:0%
can
uh

03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
give a couple of of our concerns now
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you well i think the idea that we
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
need to consider
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
overloading septic systems is important
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh what what is your other issue
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh well it's it's it's not necessarily
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
only wastewater regarding the
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
department's concern but it's also water
 
03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:25.269 align:start position:0%
department's concern but it's also water
supply

03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
supply
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
if these facilities are on
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
a private water supply or private well
 
03:45:32.070 --> 03:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
the additional draw from those wells
 
03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:33.110 align:start position:0%
the additional draw from those wells
could

03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
bring those facilities into a different
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
set of regulations regarding water
 
03:45:36.239 --> 03:45:38.710 align:start position:0%
set of regulations regarding water
supply

03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
supply
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the on-site wastewater goes
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
the systems are are sized based on the
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
on a proposed flow or an existing flow
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
and those flows are based on number of
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
seats in a restaurant
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
so of course if you increase the seats
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
you therefore increase the flow
 
03:45:56.640 --> 03:45:57.590 align:start position:0%
you therefore increase the flow
uh

03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
the septic system isn't
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
would not then be sized appropriately
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
it could uh encourage or or
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
the system may be
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
forced into premature failure
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
as a result of some sort of
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
extended loading
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh the septic tanks
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
may not be sized appropriately
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh the grease traps may not be sized
 
03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:23.110 align:start position:0%
uh the grease traps may not be sized
appropriately

03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
and then everything that the systems are
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
based on is is what's called lot loading
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
and lot loading is a
 
03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's a site characteristic it's a it's
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
based on soils it's based on slopes and
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
ledge and a number of other
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
site-specific characterizations
 
03:46:44.070 --> 03:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
and if
 
03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
if the increased
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
number of seats which would increase
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
that load it may exceed
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
lot that the
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
facility is on it may exceed that lots
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
potential or or ability to manage that
 
03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:01.110 align:start position:0%
potential or or ability to manage that
wastewater

03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%

no the
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
the outdoor lining the expansion of
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining for

okay thank you
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that needs would need to be
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
considered at the subcommittee level if
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
needed definitely a subcommittee
 
03:47:25.439 --> 03:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
needed definitely a subcommittee
material

03:47:27.030 --> 03:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
material
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%

03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair sorry
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the delay uh in figuring out the
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
mute and unmute buttons
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
i actually
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was an amendment
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
that was being offered that you're not
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
speak taking speaking to now
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
but i did want to um respond to jeff uh
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative goalie's question
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
to the extended introduce yourself first
 
03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
of course my name is matthew hood
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president of government
 
03:48:55.349 --> 03:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
relations at dartmouth hitchcock
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
is obviously on the border with vermont
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the state of vermont has issued
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
essentially temporary licensures
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
licenses through
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
march of 2022
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
and there's not a fee to that i can't
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
speak to massachusetts and maine though
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
i assume miss courtney could
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
or find out the information to that um
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to share that
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
information for
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
your consideration about the question
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
about fees
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.389 --> 03:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee my
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
name is lisa english i'm the special
 
03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
advisor for covid 19 response and
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
recovery i'm here on behalf of the
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
governor's office um as you've heard
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
senate bill 155 was designed as a
 
03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle to codify selected emergency
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
orders put in place as a result of the
 
03:49:58.080 --> 03:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
orders put in place as a result of the
pandemic

03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation's designed to provide
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
the state with that ability to continue
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
these targeted measures as we move into
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
the next stage of the pandemic in
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
recovery of the pandemic
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and director courtney
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
have addressed i think
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
almost all of the questions that i
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
certainly would be situated to be able
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to the only addition i would
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
add is that
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
with regard to the pharmacy technicians
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
on october 20th of 2020 the u.s
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
department health
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
of health and human services issued a
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
guidance document recommending that
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians be allowed to
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
administer the covid vaccine the cova 19
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that's part of an emergency
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
order it's emergency order number 79
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
that that led to that provision in this
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions but i
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
believe any of the notes that i had for
 
03:50:54.070 --> 03:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions have been addressed
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
by the earlier speakers but i wanted to
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
make sure you knew i was available
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative schuett has a
 
03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:01.429 align:start position:0%
okay representative schuett has a
question

03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you ms english since you
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
addressed the
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
question that i proposed um
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
my issue is not so much
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
enabling pharmacy technicians to
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines during the crisis
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
period my issue is that it's not
 
03:51:23.110 --> 03:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
included in the repeals
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we're hearing that it's likely that
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
these vaccines will have to be
 
03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:29.590 align:start position:0%
these vaccines will have to be
administered

03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
administered
 
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
annually the same as flu vaccines
 
03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:34.550 align:start position:0%
annually the same as flu vaccines
and

03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:35.429 align:start position:0%
and
this

03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a new provision to allow
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
these technicians to administer this
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
specific vaccine shot without repealing
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question um i
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
don't believe the guidance from the
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
federal government was limiting it in
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
time either however
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
this the goal of this particular
 
03:52:01.750 --> 03:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislation was to offer that vehicle
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
for these discussions um so
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
we don't take a stance at this point as
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
to whether or not that should be
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
included as at a sunset date or as it
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
currently stands without a sunset date
 
03:52:18.790 --> 03:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.800 --> 03:52:20.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
so uh related question and that is um
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know would there be any reason not
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
to any objection
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
to just expanding this to the pharmacy
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
technicians being able to administer uh
 
03:52:38.830 --> 03:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine thank you for that question i
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
would defer to um to oplc as well as um
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacy as to what would
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for pharmacy techs to be
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:57.120 --> 03:52:58.469 align:start position:0%

03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
so please raise your hand
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
ms burns you can unmute yourself and
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
talk to us
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for hearing my
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is margaret burns i'm
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the new
 
03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and we
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
do not have a position on senate bill
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
155 but we do have a couple of comments
 
03:53:52.710 --> 03:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to respond to some
 
03:53:54.469 --> 03:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
of the questions asked at the beginning
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
of the hearing the first question on
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 155 is sort of a technical
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
one that's probably better for
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee it's relative to
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
sections seven and eight the sections on
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
summer camps and construction
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that if this bill
 
03:54:14.790 --> 03:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
passes those sections not be codified
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
and instead be passed as a session law
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
meaning that they would not be published
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
in the published versions of the law but
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
they would still have the full force and
 
03:54:26.469 --> 03:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
effect of the law and the reason for
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of technical suggestion is
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
that those sections relate to very
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
specific discrete issues and not
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
codifying them particularly the section
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
on summer camps which would be added to
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
rsa chapter 674 would help prevent
 
03:54:46.469 --> 03:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
some already very long and complex
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
statutes from not becoming longer and
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
more complex so that's a very small
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
technical change
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
i do want to comment and respond to the
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
question about senate bill 155 and it's
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
sort of interaction with town zoning and
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
town ordinances
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
and this would be the expansion of
 
03:55:11.349 --> 03:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining section
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
the bill does recognize a local role in
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
the approval process for expansion of
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining in the section that talks
 
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
about expansion that would occur on
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
shared spaces or on a shared space and
 
03:55:30.150 --> 03:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
this would include expansion onto
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
municipal roads expansion that goes into
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
the sidewalks into municipal street
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
parking spaces or other municipally
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
owned or managed property but there
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
clearer language if this legislation
 
03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
were to pass there could be clearer
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
language about the applicability of
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
local rules regulations and ordinances
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the expansion of outdoor
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
dining and i can share with the
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee our experience at the
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
municipal association when this
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
emergency order came out the emergency
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
order that that put this language first
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
out there there was a fair amount of
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
confusion about what that meant the
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
shared spaces expansion um and the local
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
approval process and we worked with the
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to help advise
 
03:56:23.910 --> 03:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities that that was meant to
 
03:56:23.920 --> 03:56:24.790 align:start position:0%
municipalities that that was meant to
mean

03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
that local rules and regulations still
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
apply in the expansion process but the
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee does have an opportunity
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
here to
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
make that language a little bit clearer
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
our other concern would be that the
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
language may create ambiguity with
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
regard to the applicability of building
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
codes fire codes potentially other
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
safety or health codes for example the
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
original merge emergency order from
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
where this language comes had language
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
in it about the safe use of tents for
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
outdoor seating and that language is is
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
not found
 
03:57:01.590 --> 03:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill so i think there is an
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for that language to be
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
fleshed out a little bit and made
 
03:57:06.319 --> 03:57:07.349 align:start position:0%
fleshed out a little bit and made
clearer

03:57:07.349 --> 03:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
there was also a question earlier i
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
believe from representative fellows
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
about the section on construction
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipal construction
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
in during the the state of emergency and
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
the question was whether that section
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
was still needed or whether cities and
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
towns have gotten back to their normal
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
practices with issuing building permits
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
and going through those processes our
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
information and observation is that most
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
things like that have returned to normal
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
so the section may not be necessary but
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
i also don't see it as doing any harm if
 
03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's included in the legislation so that
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony on the bill
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
itself i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just reading
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
this briefly i have one quick question
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
on how a
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
city or town
 
03:58:05.520 --> 03:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
city or town
uh

03:58:06.550 --> 03:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
lines

03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
eight and nine the outdoor dining area
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
shall be clearly delineated and
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
distanced from the public
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how you distance from
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
the public when you're allowed to be on
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
a sidewalk or a street
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
that is language in the
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
the way i understand that language is
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's part of the permission that the
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
state is giving if the
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh dining establishment is able to meet
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
those standards those are not
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
municipal regulations or standards those
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
are requirements that the state is
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
putting on the outdoor dining
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
establishment to meet so
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
local rules and regulations don't
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily use that same language
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's language in the bill that the
 
03:58:59.830 --> 03:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
state is basically telling the food
 
03:59:02.070 --> 03:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
service establishment or restaurant they
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to meet in order to be able to
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
permanently expand their outdoor dining
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
but to your point
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
many terms in this part of the bill that
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
aren't defined and are not clear like
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to expand
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
permanently if it can be done safely and
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
what the word safely means is not
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
defined and could be
 
03:59:27.510 --> 03:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
subjective to the person you know
 
03:59:29.590 --> 03:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
approving it if there's no definition of
 
03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
the term
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
so that's another issue that i would
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
suggest the subcommittee um might want
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
to look at here as well as as terms like
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
the ones you're bringing up that are not
 
03:59:40.319 --> 03:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
the ones you're bringing up that are not
defined

03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
defined
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with that
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
my question would be also that you would
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
like probably to see included not to put
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but uh i don't see
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
anything in this as far as ada
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
compliance and the example of the city
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
of nashville we have put ramps in
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
off the sidewalk down to the uh
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
associated dining area so that uh
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
handicapped friends can enjoy the
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining and not have the barrier
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay that's an excellent point
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien municipalities
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to comply with the
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act and that
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually includes access to public
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
spaces like sidewalks they have an
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
obligation to do their part to make
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
sidewalks accessible to all individuals
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
including individuals who use
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs or have other disabilities
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
um that that you know the sidewalk needs
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be maintained in a certain way and so
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
this goes back to sort of the relatively
 
04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
ambiguous language about being subject
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
to local approval if it's on a quote
 
04:01:00.790 --> 04:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
shared space that has been for this the
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
duration of the state of emergency and
 
04:01:06.229 --> 04:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
this order being in effect via emergency
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
order that has been routinely um
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted to mean that municipalities
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
can put those regulations or or can put
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
those requirements on restaurants as
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
they expand to comply with certain rules
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
about the ada to comply with rules about
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
sidewalks use of the street obstruction
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
in roadways but the language could
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely be clearer and as we all
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
remember from as things were unfolding
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
issues were being dealt with very very
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
quickly and ends were needed very very
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
rapidly but to the extent that this
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to to pass legislation
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
to continue to extend outdoor dining
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's a real opportunity here to fix
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
some of the language um and and to make
 
04:01:52.150 --> 04:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
it better if it's going to be
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
at you and extended longer
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up if i may follow up
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman uh
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
such as in the case of nashua i'm on the
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure committee when we put the
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
barriers up because we do take one lane
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
of main street we made sure that they
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
were jersey barriers for the public
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
safety do you think that's something
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to be taken into account when
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
you're accessing a public way or
 
04:02:20.319 --> 04:02:21.429 align:start position:0%
you're accessing a public way or
local

04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
common sense would apply to the
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
municipality to do such
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think that our municipality are well
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
equipped to make those decisions about
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
what is needed to make outdoor dining
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
safe and that is exactly the kind of
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
considerations they need to make if a
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant is going to expand partially
 
04:02:42.150 --> 04:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
into the roadway i've seen it in nashua
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
i've seen it in concord they're expanded
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
out into what would normally be a
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
parking spot out into the road the city
 
04:02:50.950 --> 04:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
or town needs to be able to come to the
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner and say we need
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
barriers we need you know these
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
particular steps to be taken to keep
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
safe both the traveling public and the
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
dining public um and that's why it's
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
important that those local rules still
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
be in place even if this legislation is
 
04:03:05.520 --> 04:03:06.870 align:start position:0%
be in place even if this legislation is
passed

04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you miss burns for taking my
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you madam chair
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um ms burns thank
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
you for bringing up
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
concern about this sentence
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
about shared space where it says
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
coordinate and seek approval from
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
local authorities as i was confused
 
04:03:30.720 --> 04:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
local authorities as i was confused
about

04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
that because of its ambiguity and i'm
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
hoping that the intent is that they will
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
need to obtain approval from the local
 
04:03:39.439 --> 04:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
need to obtain approval from the local
authorities

04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
but my um question
 
04:03:43.040 --> 04:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
but my um question
is

04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
that this section
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
about expanding this the seating into
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
the outdoor could
 
04:03:58.150 --> 04:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
run into an issue with
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
for example a restaurant with a lot of
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
land outside it could put in
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
many more
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
tables than their indoor capacity
 
04:04:12.150 --> 04:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
is even when full seating is allowed and
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
that that would that run into some
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
local ordinances and
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
approval for occupancy and that sort of
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
thing that municipalities would be
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i think those
 
04:04:26.880 --> 04:04:27.590 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i think those
are

04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
those are potentially the types of
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
issues that municipalities look at when
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
expansions of use expansion of business
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
expansion of a building is
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
is done is they look at those particular
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
types of issues and they are
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
the the properly situated entity to look
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
at that and make decisions about um what
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
is safe and what should be permitted in
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
in their community so the example you
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
give is is very specific so i can't
 
04:05:00.150 --> 04:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
really comment on on that specifically
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
but certainly issues with occupancy and
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier about issues with you
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
know water and sewer
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
load on buildings as well we heard those
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
comments and and i think what is um so
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
sort of amazing about this sort of thing
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
is the amount of impacts that a simple
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
expansion can have
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
it can be hard to to sort of anticipate
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
all of that um but municipalities are
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
there at the ground level looking at
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
these issues and making sure that the
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
expansion is being done um safely and
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's taking into account sort of all the
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
moving parts that go into expanding the
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
size of a building or expanding a
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
business and and the impact it has on
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
the community as well as on the business
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i think it's an another good example
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
of of me
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
potentially a local issue that could
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
come out of this
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you for your response and i
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
also want to thank mr tardiff for
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
other questions oh excuse me
 
04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so miss burns uh
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh you're this is
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
obviously as you're aware a fluid and
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
situation that's also in flux so uh my
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
question is whether
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to be available for the
 
04:06:15.359 --> 04:06:16.469 align:start position:0%
you're going to be available for the
subcommittee

04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and i understand that the
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting is tomorrow if i
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
have that correct but whenever it is i
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
am um i am available to assist in any
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
way i can i don't believe the
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has yet been scheduled
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
sorry i misheard that sorry madam chair
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's a different subcommittee tomorrow
 
04:06:35.840 --> 04:06:47.030 align:start position:0%
it's a different subcommittee tomorrow
understood

04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i wanted to uh ask the
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
same question
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
that said that representative schmidt
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
asked because i did i did find that
 
04:06:58.710 --> 04:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh the local issues that are good that
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
that each town has and that they are
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
familiar with handling should have the
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
um the flexibility that they need should
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
be in this bill so i'm very pleased and
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to know if miss burns and mr
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
cardiff would be available for the
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting because i do
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
believe that it's going to
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative roy's subcommittee who i
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
see as his hands up and i'm a member of
 
04:07:22.800 --> 04:07:25.189 align:start position:0%
see as his hands up and i'm a member of
that

04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.199 --> 04:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
um when looking at this
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
find a way to match the intent of the
 
04:07:39.600 --> 04:07:40.550 align:start position:0%
find a way to match the intent of the
law

04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:07:40.560 --> 04:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
law
with

04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
the the various hurdles that
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're hearing
 
04:07:44.800 --> 04:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
we're hearing
and

04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it sounds like the
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
law would be kind of pointless because
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're suggesting
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
that it has to go through all the things
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that it currently would have to go
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
through so is there any way
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
that in your
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
view from your
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
association's view that this law could
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
pass and still have the
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
intent of enabling this outdoor dining
 
04:08:10.399 --> 04:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
intent of enabling this outdoor dining
without

04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:08:14.150 --> 04:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
doing it exactly as if this law had
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
never passed
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and what i would
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
say about the intent and i i think i
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
referenced this earlier what i would say
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
about the intent is
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
when when this language was put into an
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order back in whenever it was
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
last spring last summer
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
we understood and we have been operating
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
with our municipal members under the
 
04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:40.790 align:start position:0%
with our municipal members under the
understanding

04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:08:40.800 --> 04:08:41.590 align:start position:0%
understanding
that

04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
even the emergency order was meant to
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
continue to allow a local role
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
in the process of expanding outdoor
 
04:08:52.150 --> 04:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
dining so
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think there is still an ability to
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
have this statute be meaningful while
 
04:09:02.150 --> 04:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
allowing municipalities to exercise the
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
not only the authority but also the
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility they have so a meaningful
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
way to make it clear that their
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
authority with regard to regulating
 
04:09:11.199 --> 04:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
authority with regard to regulating
streets

04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
streets
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
parking sidewalks um things of that
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
nature still all stay intact i think
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's possible to do that and i would
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
also say and i'm certainly not an expert
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
in this area but when i look at the
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
language of the the statute it does
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
reference licensure under a separate
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
state scheme right i believe it's 148-a
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
so i believe the other intent perhaps of
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
this statutory change is to
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
impact the state licensing scheme which
 
04:09:50.150 --> 04:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
would not be a municipal um a municipal
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
issue so there's i think that intent
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
going on here as well with this part of
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay so as the
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
chair of the subcommittee i would just
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
say that i'm coming to it with a blank
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
slate i'm ambiguous either way
 
04:10:13.359 --> 04:10:14.469 align:start position:0%
slate i'm ambiguous either way
but

04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
i want to look at what the intent of the
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
drafters was and i i want to also i'm
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of issues i'm hearing
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
septic issues i'm hearing zoning issues
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
fire issues so please take and if you
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
can let me know if you're able to
 
04:10:30.150 --> 04:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
prepare um
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
both ways
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
a solution that the association will be
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with instead of just all
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
because i think we've heard all these
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
things can you can you get something
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
like that together
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
i certainly can try yes i can try to put
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
something together that will address
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the the point you're making yes
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate it
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%

liquor commission
 
04:11:16.080 --> 04:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
and

04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:17.890 --> 04:11:17.900 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
04:11:17.900 --> 04:11:19.510 align:start position:0%

certainly make myself available to the
 
04:11:21.520 --> 04:11:22.790 align:start position:0%
certainly make myself available to the
subcommittee

04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
on those issues i also wanted to point
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
out to the
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:11:28.720 --> 04:11:29.670 align:start position:0%
committee members
that

04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:31.269 --> 04:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
currently is a statute rsa 178
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
colon 24
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
and rsa 178 24
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
was recently amended in 2018
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
and expanded
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
and this is the vehicle
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the commission uses
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
to allow a licensee to extend the
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
service of alcohol
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the four walls of their
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensed business
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
and as a part of this
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
this provision
 
04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
allows the business to come to the
 
04:12:05.120 --> 04:12:06.150 align:start position:0%
allows the business to come to the
commission

04:12:06.150 --> 04:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
and present plans and diagrams etc
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that the petition
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
must conform to local zoning
 
04:12:13.680 --> 04:12:15.269 align:start position:0%
must conform to local zoning
requirements

04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
including written reports from local
 
04:12:18.239 --> 04:12:19.510 align:start position:0%
including written reports from local
officials

04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
who um i think as ms burns testified to
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
were had a variety of issues on health
 
04:12:27.670 --> 04:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
and fire and access and things of that
 
04:12:27.680 --> 04:12:28.950 align:start position:0%
and fire and access and things of that
nature

04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
nature
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
and that the commission um has the
 
04:12:31.359 --> 04:12:32.469 align:start position:0%
and that the commission um has the
ability

04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
in its discretion to deny a petition
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
under this section
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
if they see a risk to health safety or
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
welfare to the community
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
now i think in senate bill 155
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
some of this is
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
is duplicated
 
04:12:47.760 --> 04:12:49.429 align:start position:0%
is duplicated
um

04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:49.439 --> 04:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
without spending too much time it does
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
promulgate the commission it does tell
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
the commission under
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh section four that it needs to
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
um revise its administrative rules under
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
liquor rule 404.04
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
with the concerns that exist as i've
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to the testimony
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
if this provision is to
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh it needs to be harmonized i guess
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
would would probably be the best way for
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
me to describe it with the existing
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of 178.24
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it may very well be that after the
 
04:13:27.600 --> 04:13:28.870 align:start position:0%
and it may very well be that after the
subcommittee

04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
takes up this matter and reviews 178.24
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
it may determine that um maybe this bill
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
is duplicative um but i certainly wanted
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
to make the committee aware of the
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
statute 178.24 and to make myself
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
available to the subcommittee
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
in their work on this particular piece
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%

04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see any
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:14:08.000 --> 04:14:09.189 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair i'm a
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%

falls and this amendment to sb 155 which
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the state of new
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire in any of its political
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from mandating the covet 19
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccine passport or any other
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
immunity documentation or discrimination
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
against anyone for not receiving the
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccine in addition this
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
amendment prohibits the state of new
 
04:15:31.510 --> 04:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire from entering into any
 
04:15:31.520 --> 04:15:32.389 align:start position:0%

04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
or distributing any taxpayer money to
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
any private business that requires a
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
covid 19 kobe 19 vaccine passport or
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
immunity documentation of its employees
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
or patrons or in any way discriminates
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
against an employee or patron for the
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
refusal to receive a covet 19 vaccine
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports could discriminate
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
against people flying traveling trying
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
to get a job or even something as simple
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
as going to the supermarket many are
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about the disproportionate
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
impacts as something as simple as
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
requiring an id for things like voting
 
04:16:08.950 --> 04:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
this would have an even more
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on those sane
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities imagine the
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
impact that a vaccine passport could
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
have on these communities as we slowly
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
move out of the covet 19 pandemic we can
 
04:16:22.870 --> 04:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
be a society that values freedom or we
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
can be a society that segregates people
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
into groups and then discriminates
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
against one of these groups because they
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
make different medical choices than the
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
other group
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
arguably the primary purpose of
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
government is to protect the rights of
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
its people one of the most fundamental
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
rights is the right to bodily autonomy
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical decisions need to be discussion
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
between people and their doctors not
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
politicians and ceos
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports are also a gross
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
violation of medical privacy new
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution part 1
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
article 2b states an individual's right
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
to live free from government intrusion
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
in private or personal information is
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
natural inherent and essential any moves
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
from government to mandate the tracking
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
of the covid19 vaccine recipients would
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
be a violation of this section of the
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
constitution and this amendment serves
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the resolve of this state
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
to protect the privacy of its citizens
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
from government intrusion but also
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
serves to make a statement to the
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
private sector that taxpayer money will
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
not be used to support violations of
 
04:17:27.990 --> 04:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
medical privacy or infringement of the
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
right to bodily autonomy in conclusion
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports are a violation of
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
medical privacy and are also a violation
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
of our bodily autonomy vaccine passports
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
could lead to widespread discrimination
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
especially against marginalized groups
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
i urge everyone on the committee to
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
support the amendment 2021-1149-h
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
to protect the individual right to my
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
body my choice thank you madam chair
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%

04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes i am
 
04:17:58.800 --> 04:18:01.030 align:start position:0%
yes i am
representative

04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm not aware of any
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccine orders or any vaccine
 
04:18:09.760 --> 04:18:11.349 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccine orders or any vaccine
passports

04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
passports
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
the what i received when i got my
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine it was just a card is i
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
other than political rhetoric is this
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
even a thing that we need to be worried
 
04:18:21.439 --> 04:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
even a thing that we need to be worried
about

04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
question this is a preemptive measure
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent something like a vaccine
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
passport that businesses or government
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
agencies could put forward in the future
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh unh is putting forward the vaccine
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
mandate so that would be one example but
 
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is a preventive preventive measure
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent the types of discrimination
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
that i was talking about above thank you
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up
 
04:18:49.600 --> 04:18:50.870 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up
uh

04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for the reminder on unh so would
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
the way that your amendment is written
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
bar unh from setting uh rules like that
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
04:19:05.110 --> 04:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
intended only to keep their students
 
04:19:05.120 --> 04:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
intended only to keep their students
safe

04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
so yes this would bar unh from having a
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport because
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
this bill prevents any um
 
04:19:19.110 --> 04:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
government agency or private business
 
04:19:21.269 --> 04:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
that receives taxpayer fund and unh
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
would fall into that category even
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
though they're not a business
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
i guess they're a non-profit but any
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
non-profit that receives government fund
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
as well would be barred from mandating a
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport on their employees or
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
their customers um and i would just to
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
your point about the intention of
 
04:19:37.760 --> 04:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
your point about the intention of
keeping

04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
04:19:41.110 --> 04:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
their students safe
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
and i think the there's some other
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
people that are going to testify to this
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
as well but there's debate about whether
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
mandates actually lead to higher
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates and whether they
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
actually may cause a lack of public
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
trust and therefore less people to get
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine so i think in my opinion
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's very much in debate as well
 
04:19:58.479 --> 04:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
it's very much in debate as well
representative

04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh madame chair follow-up
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
um representative schultz
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
you may follow up with a question but
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
you are not to debate the witness please
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
fair enough um i'm just confused because
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
you use the term vaccine passport when
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
previously you were speaking about
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccines
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
again i don't think anyone's talking
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
about vaccine passports in new hampshire
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
and but the mandate for vaccination
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying your
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
amendment is written in a way that the
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
intent would be
 
04:20:33.199 --> 04:20:34.389 align:start position:0%
intent would be
to

04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit unh which is a state agency to
 
04:20:37.279 --> 04:20:39.349 align:start position:0%
prohibit unh which is a state agency to
not

04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
use not be able to require
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines of their students
 
04:20:44.640 --> 04:20:46.309 align:start position:0%
vaccines of their students
correct

04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:20:47.680 --> 04:20:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh this would deal with both mandates
 
04:20:52.950 --> 04:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
and vaccine passports
 
04:20:55.110 --> 04:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that's preemptive preemptive in that
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
sense that if a government agency or a
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
business or non-profit was going to
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
start to require vaccine passport unh is
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
requiring a vaccine to attend graduation
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i do think that's a very real example
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
of sort of slipping down that slippery
 
04:21:09.279 --> 04:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
of sort of slipping down that slippery
slope

04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:21:18.880 --> 04:21:20.550 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
representative

04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the language of your amendment
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
not only speaks of
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports but it also says any
 
04:21:28.720 --> 04:21:30.389 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports but it also says any
documentation

04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
so if a nursing home or hospital
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
is uh is keeping track of its employees
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination status or
 
04:21:40.800 --> 04:21:41.750 align:start position:0%
vaccination status or
their

04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
rejection of vaccination
 
04:21:44.239 --> 04:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
rejection of vaccination
uh

04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
how how are you going to keep from
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
prohibiting hospitals and nursing homes
 
04:21:51.359 --> 04:21:52.309 align:start position:0%
prohibiting hospitals and nursing homes
from

04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
protecting their patients
 
04:21:54.880 --> 04:21:55.830 align:start position:0%
protecting their patients
uh

04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
with such languages any documentation
 
04:22:01.110 --> 04:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
question so there is an exemption
 
04:22:05.110 --> 04:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation or in this
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and i believe that exemption
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
deals with your concern
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
i know follow up madam chair it it
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
it it exempts hospitals does not exempt
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and there are
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
three or four of them that i could think
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
of in dover alone where i live and serve
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
it is that not a conflict
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's that is something that is due
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
since exempting hospitals is in the bill
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee should consider whether
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
or not they should also accept nursing
 
04:22:35.920 --> 04:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
or not they should also accept nursing
homes

04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:22:37.520 --> 04:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
homes
okay

04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:41.189 --> 04:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
i was asking the representative
 
04:22:41.199 --> 04:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
i was asking the representative
okay

04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
the question well this is obviously
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to the nurse subcommittee are you
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
going to be available for the
 
04:22:53.359 --> 04:22:55.349 align:start position:0%
going to be available for the
subcommittee

04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
i'm potentially available for the
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee sure
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%

this amendment
and

04:23:41.110 --> 04:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
sorry just trying to pull it up thank
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
you um under the virtues of medical
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
ethics the patient right of
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
self-determination or bodily autonomy is
 
04:23:48.800 --> 04:23:49.990 align:start position:0%
self-determination or bodily autonomy is
paramount

04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
paramount
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
um physicians and nurses must respect
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
the medical decisions of every patient
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that they are individuals
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
with independent moral agency values
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
beliefs and culture
 
04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
who all deserve the right to make their
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
own decisions without coercion in other
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
words my body my choice
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
for a doctor to deprive a patient this
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental human right would result in
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action by the medical board
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
malpractice lawsuits and potential loss
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
of their license to practice medicine
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
physicians and nurses like myself are
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
expected to ensure this right and also
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
must and so also must any places of
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
 
04:24:28.710 --> 04:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so any place that's receiving
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money rather sorry in the area
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
era of covet 19 there is an increasing
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
tendency to marginalize and discriminate
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
against people who decline medical
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
treatments or devices such as
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or face coverings
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
this trend is reaching a pinnacle with
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
the advent of so-called vaccine
 
04:24:44.560 --> 04:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
the advent of so-called vaccine
passports

04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
passports
 
04:24:49.110 --> 04:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
may not be in a bill for new hampshire
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
this session but it is on the horizon
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it's being talked about
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
we are devolving from a nation that
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
protects the rights of its citizens to
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
have life liberty and the pursuit of
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
happiness to one in which rights are
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
only afforded to some based on their
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
private health information papers please
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
with increasing pressure from government
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
and media for businesses to require
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
customers to use uh a medical device
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
um or to receive a vaccination those who
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
decline are subjected to hardship by

carries inherent risk
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
we can't allow this to continue expert
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
opinions change science is subject to

04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
correction
 
04:26:07.510 --> 04:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
but human rights must remain intact
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
private health information is private
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to us as a governing body to
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
stop this popul this propulsion toward a
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
technocratic society in which expert
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
opinion reigns supreme over basic human
 
04:26:18.159 --> 04:26:19.269 align:start position:0%
opinion reigns supreme over basic human
rights

04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
history shows us where we are headed
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
remember how jews were treated as
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
unclean in nazi germany remember how
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
black people were treated under jim crow
 
04:26:29.110 --> 04:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
remember how hiv
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
patients were treated just as recently
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
as the 1980s
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
businesses and government must not be
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
permitted to create a medical caste
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
system therefore this amendment is
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the rights of all
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
granite staters to maintain privacy over
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
their health information and ensure
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
they're not marginalized for exercise
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
exercising their right to
 
04:26:46.880 --> 04:26:48.389 align:start position:0%
exercising their right to
self-determination

04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative cushman i'd like you to
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
put your nurses cap on
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
for this in particular
 
04:27:07.920 --> 04:27:09.269 align:start position:0%
for this in particular
um

04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're trying to do
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
here but do you see any other equal
 
04:27:14.080 --> 04:27:15.269 align:start position:0%
here but do you see any other equal
overreach

04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
such as if this amendment went through
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh a student entering into the school
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
system has to provide some documentation
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
of immunization do you see any overreach
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
into that area as a nurse do you see any
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
particular overreach into that area that
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
would stop a student from providing that
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
type of information
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't know if overreach is
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the term but there are exemptions for
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements for schools in
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
we have religious exemption and we have
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
medical exemption so there are
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know um beliefs belief systems to
 
04:28:00.870 --> 04:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
take into consideration people have the
 
04:28:00.880 --> 04:28:01.670 align:start position:0%
take into consideration people have the
right

04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
um to act according to their conscience
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
and their truly and sincerely held
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs as well as
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
any medical excuse me medical
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
may prevent someone from getting a
 
04:28:13.520 --> 04:28:16.229 align:start position:0%
may prevent someone from getting a
vaccination

04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking a question
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
no my question was answered well by uh
 
04:28:24.000 --> 04:28:27.189 align:start position:0%
no my question was answered well by uh
representative

04:28:27.189 --> 04:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are you
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps concerned that this amendment
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
under reaches in that everything is
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
called covet 19 and what do we do when
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's covet 20 and the north pole
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
variant and
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
these things perhaps won't be covered
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll have passports up for those in
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
the future
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
sure i think that you know we have a
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent being set with the
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
way that government is reacting to covet
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
19 and businesses as well
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing kind of backpedaling on
 
04:29:01.590 --> 04:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
advancements in medical ethics that we
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
that have occurred over the last 70
 
04:29:03.439 --> 04:29:04.389 align:start position:0%
that have occurred over the last 70
years

04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i would i would definitely like to
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
see this expand to
 
04:29:11.910 --> 04:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
um to any and all medical treatments or
 
04:29:11.920 --> 04:29:15.349 align:start position:0%
um to any and all medical treatments or
vaccinations

04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.189 --> 04:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:29:17.199 --> 04:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
phillips

04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
phillips
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative cushman you mentioned
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
that for students
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
they need to provide
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccinations to their schools
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
but there are exemptions for medical or
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
religious reasons so should we ever get
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
to the point where
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
there are passports would you be
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay with it if the pat if you could get
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
a passport saying you had a medical or a
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
and then passports would be okay
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
i would not support
 
04:29:56.159 --> 04:29:57.189 align:start position:0%
i would not support
such

04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
such
 
04:29:57.199 --> 04:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
such
restrictive

04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions to
 
04:30:00.960 --> 04:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
exemptions to
having

04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know to being able to carry out your
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
activities of daily life
 
04:30:06.319 --> 04:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
activities of daily life
um

04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
even the requirements for schools
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
any reason that someone objects to
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination whether it's conscientious
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
philosophical religious
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
um cultural
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know should all be valid reasons no
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
one should ever be forced
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
to take a medical treatment against
 
04:30:31.030 --> 04:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
their will and no one should ever be
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
marginalized in society for for not
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
taking something
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to take
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes one is fine
 
04:30:45.439 --> 04:30:46.469 align:start position:0%
yes one is fine
so

04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
the passports um
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
they don't require the passport would
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
not be a requirement that somebody get
 
04:30:53.680 --> 04:30:55.349 align:start position:0%
not be a requirement that somebody get
vaccinated

04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you're you're

trying to debate the
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
the witness i think that's that's
 
04:31:03.920 --> 04:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
the witness i think that's that's

inappropriate
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%

be

04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
um so you're correct it's that a vaccine
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
passport is not technically a mandate
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
but by placing
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
a a requirement for someone to have
 
04:31:35.830 --> 04:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
something in order to participate in
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
various areas of society
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
you are coercing people into getting a
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's like a back door mandate
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
and many people because they wish to
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
participate in society like others
 
04:31:53.110 --> 04:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
who don't you know many people who don't
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
want a vaccine but wish to participate
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
in society like they always have and
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
like everyone else has the right to
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
may give in because of these coercive
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
measures you know so it's a backdoor
 
04:32:05.279 --> 04:32:08.710 align:start position:0%
measures you know so it's a backdoor
mandate

04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
um we've discussed
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
with regard to um you know personal
 
04:32:20.479 --> 04:32:21.670 align:start position:0%
with regard to um you know personal
autonomy

04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
with with regard to these um
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and mandates and such but
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
could you speak a little bit to um the
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
privacy aspect to it so a question you
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
just got was
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know what if i had a
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
passport that
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
showed that i was exempt for religious
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
reasons wouldn't that in any event
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
reveal a private medical decision or
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
choice i had made to someone that was
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the representative cut out can
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
you repeat the question representative
 
04:33:07.199 --> 04:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
you repeat the question representative
roy

04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
04:33:14.080 --> 04:33:14.869 align:start position:0%
you talked about
the

04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
individual autonomy as far as making
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
medical decisions and not being forced
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
by the state but could you address the
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
privacy issue a question you got related
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
to passports
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
said well what if the passport said that
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
you were exempt isn't the fact you made
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
a choice to be exempt also a private
 
04:33:34.230 --> 04:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
medical matter that that would be then
 
04:33:34.240 --> 04:33:36.629 align:start position:0%
medical matter that that would be then
exposed

04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um yeah i
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
agree it is a privacy issue there are
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
only specific um
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
what's the word yeah i guess just very
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
specific instances in society where that
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
people are privy to that information
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it's you know under ferpa for school
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
officials it's under hipaa for medical
 
04:34:00.240 --> 04:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
officials it's under hipaa for medical
professionals

04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's no precedent and there this it's
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
never been
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
that anyone in society can ask you this
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
this private information about your
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%

hello um
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for my comments i'm just uh
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
calling in in support of the amendment
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to make an additional
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
note that
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
i don't believe a passport uh should be
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think is a good idea because
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh how even having a vaccine passport
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
required in any case um
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
would mandate that somebody
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
could you please introduce yourself and
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.561 --> 04:36:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention to the people that
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
are here for the amendment on senate
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill 133
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
that it is not going to start at 2 30.
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
it is more i believe we can postpone it
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
until 3 30 based on the amount of number
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
of people who signed up to speak on this
 
04:37:00.080 --> 04:37:01.029 align:start position:0%
of people who signed up to speak on this
bill

04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:37:01.039 --> 04:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
bill
so

04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
please take a break we will get we will
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
get to it today but
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
not for at least 45 minutes
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
represent harvey boglio
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
you're back could you uh introduce
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%

okay i'm sorry um i don't know what you
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
heard but um just to reiterate i'm in
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i do not believe it is uh
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
require any sort of um
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
papers any sort of uh
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
visit to a to a medical facility
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
so and that that's
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
the main reason thank you that's all i
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%

04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%

can you hear me
 
04:38:26.959 --> 04:38:28.709 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
yeah there's not much i can add to what
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
representatives back baxter and cushman
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
said but i'll just mention my own
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
personal feelings at this point
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
i will never get vaccinated
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in the germ theory of
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
disease i believe in the terrain theory
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
of disease so i don't believe
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we need vaccines to protect us from
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
so-called germs real or not
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
in this particular case with cov19 it's
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
highly questionable whether there is a
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
virus because no one's isolated it
 
04:38:57.600 --> 04:38:58.789 align:start position:0%
virus because no one's isolated it
but

04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to be coerced into
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting one of these vaccine passports
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why i strongly support this
 
04:39:05.520 --> 04:39:07.029 align:start position:0%
and that's why i strongly support this
bill

04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:39:08.949 --> 04:39:08.959 align:start position:0%
and i feel that if you don't control
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
your own body you are a slave
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
to unmute yourself and speak to us
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
great well good afternoon madam chair
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
beth daley i'm the chief of the bureau
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
of infectious disease control at the
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to provide information on sb
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
155 fn as amended the department is not
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill but we
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide some accurate
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
information relative to section 9 which
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting coven 19 vaccination
 
04:39:50.480 --> 04:39:51.750 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting coven 19 vaccination
requirements

04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
as you all know immunization is
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
considered one of the most important
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
public health achievements of the last
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
century and they've prevented millions
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
of illnesses disabilities and deaths
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
here in the united states in new
 
04:40:02.560 --> 04:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
here in the united states in new
hampshire

04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have been providing the coven 19
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine now for five or so months and
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the covid19 vaccine specifically has
 
04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
already prevented millions of illnesses
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of deaths in the united states
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire it has reduced our
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
covet 19 deaths by 92
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
since we introduced it which is really
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
great news
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
these coven 19 vaccines are authorized
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
for use by the fda they are not
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs clinical trial
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
data for all of these authorized and
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
recommended covit 19 vaccines were
 
04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
carefully reviewed by the fda to make
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
sure that they are safe and effective
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
and there were no shortcuts taken
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
now because vaccination coverage is not
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
nor are these vaccines 100 effective
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
there may be some settings where
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
implementing vaccine requirements are
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to be important and one example of
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is in healthcare settings many
 
04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities already require
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
certain employee vaccinations to protect
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
the lives of their most vulnerable
 
04:41:04.240 --> 04:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
the lives of their most vulnerable
patients

04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
one example of this is the influenza
 
04:41:07.280 --> 04:41:08.708 align:start position:0%
one example of this is the influenza
vaccination

04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
and this is an accepted part of working
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
in healthcare because first you want to
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
do no harm to your patients
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
we see that there is an exemption for
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
medical facilities in this proposed bill
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
but the language suggests that employers
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
are making the determination of what a
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
direct threat constitutes for themselves
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
which would lead
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
likely lead to inconsistent application
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the law throughout the state it also
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
opens the door for future restrictions
 
04:41:39.270 --> 04:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
on immunization requirements and may
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
have other unintended consequences
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
for example there are laws in place
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
already that require certain vaccines
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
for children to enter school and these
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
laws are critical to public health and
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
they must not be jeopardized
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
this proposal is also problematic
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
because in order to comply with state
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
and federal kovid 19 requirements
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
employers and health care facilities
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
must take employee coven 19 vaccination
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
status into consideration for example
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
after an employee has been exposed to
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
coven 19 they do not need to quarantine
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
if they have been vaccinated however if
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
they have not been vaccinated that
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
employee does need to quarantine and
 
04:42:20.708 --> 04:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
cannot go to work or school
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
under existing law people already have a
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
choice of whether to be vaccinated
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a person's individual
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
decision on whether to be vaccinated
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
puts others who are vulnerable at risk
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense that in some settings
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
such as health care we also have an
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect those vulnerable
 
04:42:38.000 --> 04:42:39.270 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect those vulnerable
persons

04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
persons
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
i also want to draw your attention to
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is another bill
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
circulating through the legislature
 
04:42:46.470 --> 04:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 220 medical freedom and
 
04:42:46.480 --> 04:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
house bill 220 medical freedom and
immunizations

04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
which provides for a very similar policy
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
proposal so if nothing else this
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment is unnecessary as
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
there is already another bill addressing
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
this topic
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any of your
 
04:43:01.200 --> 04:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any of your
questions

04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:43:04.470 --> 04:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
represent bailey
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
could you show me perks hold it up so i
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
could see it your smallpox passport or
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bailey i'm not
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.760 --> 04:43:32.788 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question uh
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
you cited some interesting statistics
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
but i would note that they're
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
strictly correlative
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a background in science you
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
know that correlation is not causation
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
so how do you know
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
that any change in the rate of infection
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
or in survivability
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with the
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
availability of a vaccine
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
well fortunately we have access to
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
patient-level information that's able to
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
make these determinations for us so if
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
you look at our long-term care facility
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
outbreaks which we were experiencing at
 
04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
very high rates there were many many
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
over 100 long-term care facilities that
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
were impacted by coven 19.
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and once we started vaccinating these
 
04:44:24.150 --> 04:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
facilities these outbreaks stopped
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
occurring even though we were
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing significant community
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
transmission of cobit 19 so these were
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
really protected because they had such
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
great vaccination rates in those
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
settings and when you look at who's
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
dying right now in new hampshire it's
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
i wave the following it's okay thank you
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
hello dr bailey daley sorry uh i'm just
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
curious you mentioned another bill that
 
04:44:53.680 --> 04:44:55.590 align:start position:0%
curious you mentioned another bill that
has

04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
or the same tenants in it do you know
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
which committee that bill went to
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes it was in the hhs and elderly
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
affairs committee
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that seemed to me a more
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
logical place for this kind of issue
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:13.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.350 --> 04:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
other questions for miss daily
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none i call martin kohler
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative schmidt
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair so dr
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
daley thank you very much for being with
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.240 --> 04:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee hearing format is very
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive as you know questions and
 
04:45:35.120 --> 04:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
restrictive as you know questions and
answers

04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
answers
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee that's going to be
 
04:45:37.920 --> 04:45:38.948 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee that's going to be
held

04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
held
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
will permit more of a dialogue to
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
eventuate will you be available for the
 
04:45:43.280 --> 04:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
eventuate will you be available for the
subcommittee

04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
i will try to make myself a bill
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
available for that obviously my time is
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
quite limited as we're still responding
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic but i certainly will do
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
my best to contribute in some way
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you or perhaps one of your subs
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
associates would be available one of
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
your colleagues
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.000 --> 04:46:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
kaldorf

04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes can you hear me
 
04:46:14.000 --> 04:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
uh yes can you hear me
yes

04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:18.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
martin koldov i'm a professor of
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
medicine at harvard medical school
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i've been doing vaccine research for
 
04:46:28.628 --> 04:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
almost two decades
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a huge fan of vaccines and
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
i have two concerns about vaccines
 
04:46:33.520 --> 04:46:35.510 align:start position:0%
i have two concerns about vaccines
passports

04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
passports
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have spent many decades trying to
 
04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
promote vaccines and ensure vaccine
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
confidence and
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
for all vaccines
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
and by trying to do coercion that
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
limits the trust that is necessary for
 
04:46:52.958 --> 04:46:54.390 align:start position:0%
limits the trust that is necessary for
vaccines

04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
trust is a fundamental principle of
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
public health both that
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
the public trust public health
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
authorities but also that public health
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
authorities trust
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
and by trying to do a coercion
 
04:47:09.040 --> 04:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
and by trying to do a coercion
that

04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
may reduce the trust in vaccines and
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine confidence and not only for the
 
04:47:18.628 --> 04:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
corporate vaccine but also for
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
other vaccines like influenza vaccine
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
and childhood vaccines like for measles
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and polio and so on
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
so that is a major public health concern
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
with vaccine passports and vaccine
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
mandates that
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
it will reduce the confidence of
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and i think we've already
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
started to see
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
that even just discussing mandates and
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
passports the other concern is that the
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
covet is a very uh
 
04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
anybody can get caught with but the risk
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
of mortality the risk of death is 100
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
000 full difference between the oldest
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and the youngest
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
so what's most critical is that we
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinate older people because they are
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
the ones who are at risk of dying
 
04:48:01.040 --> 04:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
the ones who are at risk of dying
and

04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
we still have a shortage of vaccines
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
less so in the u.s now but certainly
 
04:48:05.840 --> 04:48:07.350 align:start position:0%
less so in the u.s now but certainly
worldwide

04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
worldwide
 
04:48:07.360 --> 04:48:09.030 align:start position:0%
worldwide
so

04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
if we mandate
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines for younger people who are
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
very limited risk for this disease and
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
less so than your influenza
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
that means that there's going to be less
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines available for older people both
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the united states but also very
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
importantly around the world for example
 
04:48:28.868 --> 04:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
now there are huge outbreaks in india
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
and brazil and other countries and all
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
people there do not have the vaccines
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
available to them that they need
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that's a global issue but i think we
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
all need to think globally about these
 
04:48:41.200 --> 04:48:42.788 align:start position:0%
all need to think globally about these
things

04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
so those are two public health reasons
 
04:48:48.310 --> 04:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
why vaccine passports are not a good
 
04:48:48.320 --> 04:48:49.350 align:start position:0%
why vaccine passports are not a good
idea

04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
and while the intention is to reduce
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
mortality they might actually increase
 
04:48:54.560 --> 04:48:56.390 align:start position:0%
mortality they might actually increase
mortality

04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
and also affect the confidence in other
 
04:49:00.868 --> 04:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines not only coffee vaccines so
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for letting me speak
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take a question
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
very good representative schmidt
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair so dr uh
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony is very interesting uh
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
but the the
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're looking at
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
not only
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
speaks of vaccine passports but it says
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
any documentation regarding vaccination
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
so uh are you saying that there should
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
who are getting the vaccine
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
on whatever basis
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
there should be no record of it and and
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
they should have no way of demonstrating
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether they have had a vaccine or not
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh no that's a good question certainly
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
not the vaccine records are important
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
both so that people know can remember if
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated but also in the
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare setting
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's very important that they are in the
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
electronic health records that there are
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
records that a certain person was
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated because that determines
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
whether they should be vaccinated later
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
on for example
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
so registering to have a registry
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
or vaccines or to have it in the health
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
records is a very important thing a very
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
good idea the problem is if there are
 
04:50:19.680 --> 04:50:21.110 align:start position:0%
good idea the problem is if there are
mandates

04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
or passports that require people to be
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to for example go to
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants or attend the university and
 
04:50:30.390 --> 04:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow madam chair
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh dr uh professor
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh so uh there's going to be a
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this and would you be
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
available for the subcommittee because
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that is a very
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh complex with regard to how this would
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
be handled and your expertise would be
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
invaluable would you be available
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh if my if it's the schedule at the
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
time when i'm free then certainly yes
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
i'll be willing to talk to the
 
04:51:00.958 --> 04:51:02.628 align:start position:0%
i'll be willing to talk to the
subcommittee

04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative roy
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:51:10.470 --> 04:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um since you said
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
that you had been studying the subject
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
of vaccines and epidemiology for quite
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
some time
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
could you
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
tell me if you know
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
what the success rate or or how it's
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
turned out in countries around the world
 
04:51:27.750 --> 04:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
that have mandated vaccines and mandated
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
so for kovitz those are very limited now
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to speak to that because
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
i think there's not enough follow-up to
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
to determine that
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are certain vaccine requirements
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
for example for hospital personnel for
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccines
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
and there are certain requirements for
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
travel vaccines
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
but i think in general
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
there has never been proposed ever
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
the kind of vaccine passport eventually
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
mandates that
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
are being discussed currently around the
 
04:52:04.480 --> 04:52:08.830 align:start position:0%
are being discussed currently around the
world

04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.840 --> 04:52:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
i did not hear the follow question no
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if he wants to do you hear
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
me now
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
i do so follow okay i'm sorry yes please
 
04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking one more
 
04:52:36.958 --> 04:52:40.948 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking one more
question

04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
on that i'm aware that there are
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
countries that
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
leave it aside we can talk about
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
smallpox or percussives or other things
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
that mandate vaccines and i was
 
04:52:54.550 --> 04:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any insight into
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
whether that actually increased the rate
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
of vaccines in those countries or
 
04:52:59.910 --> 04:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
whether it
 
04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
what the if it had positive or negative
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
outcomes do you have any information on
 
04:53:02.958 --> 04:53:04.550 align:start position:0%
outcomes do you have any information on
that

04:53:04.550 --> 04:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh of any country that uh
 
04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
mandates uh this whole population to
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine
 
04:53:13.040 --> 04:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine
uh

04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh domestically i'm not aware of that of
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
any such country the mantas i'm aware of
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
are specific to
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
to for example people working in
 
04:53:22.878 --> 04:53:24.070 align:start position:0%
to for example people working in
hospital

04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
or there is mandates to travel to
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
certain countries in africa you need to
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
have a yellow
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%

to sb 155 prohibiting state supported

receive the covet vaccine
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
or provide proof of vaccination status
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
i urge you to take the action to protect

individual privacy liberty and freedom

decisions for new hampshire citizens
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
myself and my husband and many other new
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens that i know
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
are not ready or willing to be part of
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
an experimental medical trial for the
 
04:54:38.878 --> 04:54:40.150 align:start position:0%
an experimental medical trial for the
injections

04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
injections
 
04:54:42.390 --> 04:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
currently only authorized for emergency
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
use for coven 19
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
with clinical safety and efficacy
 
04:54:46.798 --> 04:54:47.830 align:start position:0%
with clinical safety and efficacy
trials

04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
trials
 
04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
not scheduled for completion until 2023
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
with so many reports and possibly
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
unreported adverse reactions
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
no guarantee of efficacy and no
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
long-term studies for safety
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
any type of coercion to take the coven
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
19 injections would be unjust and
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
irresponsible at this time
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
every day there are news reports to the
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
of serious adverse events injuries and
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
deaths occurring in close proximity to
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
these experimental shots
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
and new information keeps coming out for
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
example from israel which started
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinating earlier than most countries
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
indicating heart problems when younger
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
people are vaccinated furthermore there
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
is no documented proof that the shots
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
stop the spread
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
in fact is evidenced by more and more
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases of covid coming to
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
light in fully vaccinated people it does
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
not serve us to instill the notion that
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
workplace and public spaces should
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
exclude unb vaccinated people to make
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
them safer
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
please support this amendment and
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
protect new hampshire citizens from
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination for choosing not to take
 
04:56:00.550 --> 04:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
the experimental injections or showing
 
04:56:00.560 --> 04:56:01.430 align:start position:0%
the experimental injections or showing
proof

04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
proof
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
of injection
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
also please take note of all the
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
references included in my written
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
testimony which i submitted yesterday
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you ms schreier
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
i will
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
represent yeshua has one
 
04:56:22.550 --> 04:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
um ms schreier you you mentioned uh
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
that you're waiting to hear uh results
 
04:56:28.240 --> 04:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
that you're waiting to hear uh results
of

04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
tests and experiments and so forth if
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
all of those come back
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
validating the 90
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
efficacy rate that they are
 
04:56:39.440 --> 04:56:40.310 align:start position:0%
efficacy rate that they are
um

04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
producing right now would you then be
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
willing to take the vaccinations
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
well i will say that um that totally
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
04:56:49.680 --> 04:56:50.470 align:start position:0%
depends on
the

04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
efficacy of of the studies and also on
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
the adverse events that are starting to
 
04:56:57.990 --> 04:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
be more and more reported
 
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh and the long-term studies
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
for 2023 is still not
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
as long as most vaccines have had and
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
this is not a normal vaccine
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
this is very different my understanding
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
from the definition of a medical vaccine
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
in history so i would not say
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes or no but i would
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
most likely be very very cautious to say
 
04:57:22.480 --> 04:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
most likely be very very cautious to say
yes

04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%

04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
state we're testifying only on the
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um as you stated earlier
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any concerns with the
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but we do have concerns
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
with section 9 of the amendment that is
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
being discussed
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
um while there is an exemption for
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
medical facilities on page two um lines
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
24 and 25
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
the language is very unclear to us and
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
dr daley kind of um
 
04:58:19.520 --> 04:58:20.390 align:start position:0%
dr daley kind of um
um

04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
stated that and we agree um the direct
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
threat which is defined in on page 2
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
lines 20
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
to 30
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
do require an individualized assessment
 
04:58:37.030 --> 04:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the individual's present ability to
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
safely perform the essential functions
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
of the job
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
that effectively means to us that all
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
hospital employees would need to be
 
04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
individually assessed to determine if
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
the standard could be met
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
that would mean
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
since new hampshire hospitals employ
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 41 000 employees
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
a requirement that we believe is not
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
feasible and equates to an unfunded
 
04:59:04.080 --> 04:59:05.590 align:start position:0%
feasible and equates to an unfunded
mandate

04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals care for sick patients
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
including those that are contr con have
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
contracted coven 19.
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
they must ensure that their staff their
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
patients and others that enter the
 
04:59:19.350 --> 04:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
hospital are all safe the amendment does
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
not address public safety and or public
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
health which must be contemplated when
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
considering safeguards focused on
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
privacy related to the covid 19 pandemic
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we do not support
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
section 9 of the amendment
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i think representative schuett might
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
have suggested that um this be
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
contemplated or moved are
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
considered in hhs which as um dr daley
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
said um
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 220 and other bills related
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
to this topic were in um house hhs so
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
just um
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
just a thought and and um
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
house bill um
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
on 220 is currently in senate hhs um
 
05:00:06.070 --> 05:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
with senator bradley's committee i'm
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
happy to um

answer any questions thank you for the
 
05:00:09.440 --> 05:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you for the
opportunity

05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me can i just mention um a
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
colleague courtney tanner um does would

like to testify and i'm sure
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative maguire you allow for
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
others but um she um was not able to she
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
registered but did not hit
 
05:00:27.670 --> 05:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
check the right box so if you would i
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
will we will
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
other people who wish to testify i
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you representative
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
very much and representative has a
 
05:00:35.440 --> 05:00:36.390 align:start position:0%
very much and representative has a
question

05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair um
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
the number you uh mentioned concerning
 
05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
the number of employees that you'd have
 
05:00:46.230 --> 05:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
to do individual assessments for
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
i mean would you actually have to do
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
that for all of them under this
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment or only the ones that uh
 
05:00:54.550 --> 05:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know chose not to get the vaccine
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
or not to provide any uh documentation
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.680 --> 05:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:00.480 --> 05:01:01.190 align:start position:0%
it
well

05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
potentially depending on how this um was
 
05:01:08.070 --> 05:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
worded if um if depending on again um
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just indicating that that's how many
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
employees potentially
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
um could would need to go through that
 
05:01:14.878 --> 05:01:16.788 align:start position:0%
um could would need to go through that
um

05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
assessment i need to read it because the
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
exemption only
 
05:01:21.360 --> 05:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
exemption only
applies

05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
applies
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
where a direct threat exists
 
05:01:28.708 --> 05:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
again i find the language and the
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
exemption very confusing um and so the
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
way i read it
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm just mis
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting it
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
but you have to determine the direct
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
threat and the only way you determine
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the direct threat
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
by definition
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
is if you if the individual it has to be
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
on an individual um poses a direct
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
the determination that an individual
 
05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
poses a direct threat
 
05:01:54.160 --> 05:01:56.628 align:start position:0%
poses a direct threat
so

05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm not quite sure in order for the
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals to comply with this law
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
if passed
 
05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
um it could potentially
 
05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
require them to go through that process
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
for thousands of employees
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's just hospitals too um i think
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
there are others um other healthcare
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that may and and providers
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
testifying today or have have um
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
indicated their concerns
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
um we're just representing hospitals but
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and others
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
other physician offices could be in this
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:44.310 --> 05:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
so paula uh
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
would it not also be the case i know you
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
represent the hospitals but wouldn't
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill have passed in this
 
05:02:54.718 --> 05:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill have passed in this
form

05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
would it not also implicate essentially
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
every doctor's office
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
and all their employees
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:03:04.560 --> 05:03:05.430 align:start position:0%
as well
um

05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
yes i again i think the exemption is
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
limited it does not define medical
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
facility sorry i just lost the paper ah
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
does not define medical facility
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
typically these bills when you define a
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
medical um
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
health care it's usually a health care
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
facility and it's usually under rsa 151
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
which is where
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and long-term care
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
home care a number of facilities
 
05:03:30.718 --> 05:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
home care a number of facilities
are

05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:03:31.440 --> 05:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
are
licensed

05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
as you i think as you know because your
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
edna um
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
doctors offices do not fall under a
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
health facility license they fall under
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine
 
05:03:46.550 --> 05:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
if the intent was to um address all
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
medical providers and facilities
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
yes it would also
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
impact the doctors
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
as well as community health centers
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
the list could go on
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair
 
05:04:07.760 --> 05:04:09.110 align:start position:0%

05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
with an uh with our
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
riverside rest home which uh takes care
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
of about 200 people
 
05:04:23.600 --> 05:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
of about 200 people
uh

05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
isn't it the case that there's a fair
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount of interaction between nursing
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
homes which i understand you don't
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
recognize i just represent uh but
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
nursing home patients frequently go to
 
05:04:40.150 --> 05:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
the hospital and come back would it not
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
also implicate nursing homes and all
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
their staff and and uh
 
05:04:45.360 --> 05:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
their staff and and uh
and

05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
would they not also be involved with the
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
language of this amendment
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yes um they are also
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
licensed under health facilities and
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
you're right i don't represent them but
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes um they go back and forth um
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
frequently when they need medical
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
services they will be transported to the
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
hospital and um
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
or if they have to be admitted to the
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
hospital so yes i believe that they
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
would be included thank you
 
05:05:10.958 --> 05:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
would be included thank you

good afternoon afternoon yes we hear you
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself and
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly my name is laura condon i live
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
in bedford and i am a volunteer new
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire director of advocacy with the
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
national vaccine information center and
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
as such i'm off on a contact point from
 
05:05:58.390 --> 05:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
various members of the the public
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
parents legislators medias when it comes
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
to regard to vaccines
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's hard to follow the presentation of
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative baxter and representative
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
cushman here in presenting this bill i
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
think they are
 
05:06:15.270 --> 05:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
made tremendous presentations um
 
05:06:17.670 --> 05:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
representing that this bill is timely
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and is needed um
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
to protect the public against um vaccine
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
mandates that we're now seeing beginning
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
to occur at unh and other places
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
i should mention uh and make a
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
correction here
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
um to to what beth daley testified
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
these coveted shots are not fda licensed
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
they are as a distinction they are
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used under emergency use
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
authorization only
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
there is a very
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
scientific and legal distinction between
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
those two processes and i think that
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
the public should be aware of that that
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
these vaccines have not been
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
fully evaluated for safety and advocacy
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
there was also she also mentioned about
 
05:07:08.320 --> 05:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
there was also she also mentioned about
um

05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative there was a decline in
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
deaths i actually work for the insurance
 
05:07:16.390 --> 05:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
industry and last week we had an
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
actuarial presentation we were looking
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
into how covet impacted life insurers
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
and health insurers
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
it was noted that there has been about a
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
ten percent increase
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
in deaths for for life insurers
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
not not an increase that the industry
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't handle that's certainly
 
05:07:33.280 --> 05:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
couldn't handle that's certainly
manageable

05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
05:07:34.400 --> 05:07:35.350 align:start position:0%
manageable
and

05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
it is not unlike the increase that the
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
life insurance industry will often see
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
in a bad flu
 
05:07:41.760 --> 05:07:42.788 align:start position:0%
in a bad flu
season

05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
season
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
so this has been seen before
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
what these type of death increases often
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
see in a subsequent year as a
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
significant decline in deaths as the
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
most frail and the most elderly have
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
died in the previous year
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
bring any vaccine in the market
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
cannot claim credit for that natural
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
decline in deaths because there are less
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
alleluian frail people so it's a
 
05:08:06.958 --> 05:08:09.590 align:start position:0%
alleluian frail people so it's a
misrepresentation

05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation
 
05:08:10.868 --> 05:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
miss condon
 
05:08:13.110 --> 05:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes this is fascinating but if you could
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
concentrate your testimony on the bill
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
in front of us or the amendment in front
 
05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay the point is that
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
coralization correlation is not
 
05:08:23.200 --> 05:08:24.708 align:start position:0%
coralization correlation is not
causation

05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
causation
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
when claiming benefits of these vaccines
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
it is important to protect against
 
05:08:34.550 --> 05:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and the passports
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
the um vaccine adverse event reporting
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
system that the cdc relies on has
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
already recorded 486 adverse events in
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from these coveted shots
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and 33 deaths
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing coveted vaccines um
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
experience failure
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
um dhhs has reported already 24 cases
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
and two deaths from covid following
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination and they're expecting more
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of these vaccines are quite
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous in fact we've all seen that
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
the jansen vax was suspended their use
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
was suspended because of blood clots and
 
05:09:08.798 --> 05:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
was suspended because of blood clots and
deaths

05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee and immunization
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
practices voted last friday to allow
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
this vaccine this particular coveted
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
shot back on the market but it was a
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
split decision ten to four the four
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
dissenting mentors were
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
terribly distressed that it would be
 
05:09:26.948 --> 05:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
allowed back on the market without
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
disclosing and warning the public of the
 
05:09:32.550 --> 05:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
hazards that they are made aware of
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
the direct threat language here
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill is an equal
 
05:09:36.638 --> 05:09:38.708 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill is an equal
opportunity

05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
employment provision and um provisions
 
05:09:44.550 --> 05:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the ada and civil rights protections
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
that hospitals cannot force vaccines
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
without making any accommodations
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i think um given all these concerns
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment that would allow
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
protection against vaccine mandates and
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
again events
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
against vaccine passports is timely and
 
05:10:05.270 --> 05:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
needed so i i do urge you to support it
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%

05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment which would create
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
chapter 9g
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
as it relates to covet vaccinate
 
05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination status and documentation
 
05:11:12.560 --> 05:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
vaccination status and documentation
first

05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's important to know that home care
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
and hospice providers care for many of
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable citizens in their
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
own homes
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the safety of our staff and our
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
patients is our highest priority
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
home care and hospice agencies have
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
encouraged staff to receive coveted
 
05:11:31.280 --> 05:11:32.708 align:start position:0%
encouraged staff to receive coveted
vaccines

05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
but we respect the rights of those who
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
choose not to be vaccinated
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
i am unaware of any association members
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
that are mandating covert vaccines for
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
their staff
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
but this amendment would prevent
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
providers from requesting vaccination
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
status from their staff
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
and it's important to know that it's
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
essential that agencies know which of
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
our staff have been vaccinated and which
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
have not
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
as their status may impact which
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
patients they are assigned to care for
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients who have certain medical
 
05:12:06.000 --> 05:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
patients who have certain medical
conditions

05:12:07.110 --> 05:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
are severely immunocompromised
 
05:12:11.350 --> 05:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
or who themselves are unable to be
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated are at higher risk of
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
contracting covet 19.
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
so agencies may choose to adopt special
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
ppe protocols for unvaccinated staff
 
05:12:24.788 --> 05:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
that's not discrimination
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's good medical practice
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
in home care and hospice because
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
these staff are going into people's
 
05:12:33.600 --> 05:12:34.708 align:start position:0%
these staff are going into people's
homes

05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
homes
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
patients can decline services from
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
specific staff
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
so i will tell you that in the past
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
couple weeks i have heard from agencies
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
who are getting requests from patients
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
to only send vaccinated staff to their
 
05:12:48.718 --> 05:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
to only send vaccinated staff to their
home

05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:12:52.550 --> 05:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so agencies have to do their best to
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
honor these patient
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
requests the direct threat clause on
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 20
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh and the medical exemption
 
05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
that applies to medical facilities
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
we believe that the medical so home care
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
and hospice agencies are defined as
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
health care facilities under rsa 151
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
but the direct threat clause is really
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
unworkable because as ms minihan stated
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would require a health care provider
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
to evaluate each employee's potential
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
threat to patients
 
05:13:31.030 --> 05:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
and home care and hospice agencies need
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to adopt policies that apply
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
consistently to all unvaccinated staff
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
and not be required by law to assess
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
each unvaccinated employee
 
05:13:45.510 --> 05:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i respectfully request that you find
 
05:13:48.628 --> 05:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
amendment 1149h as inexpedient to
 
05:13:48.638 --> 05:13:49.830 align:start position:0%
amendment 1149h as inexpedient to
legislate

05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.750 --> 05:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon miss balkas so
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
you raised one of the issues that we had
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
not explored up to this point and that
 
05:14:08.480 --> 05:14:09.190 align:start position:0%
not explored up to this point and that
is

05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
this home care situation
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh can you give us a rough estimate of
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
how many people are in home care in new
 
05:14:17.360 --> 05:14:18.310 align:start position:0%
how many people are in home care in new
hampshire

05:14:18.310 --> 05:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
and and also how many people
 
05:14:20.958 --> 05:14:22.070 align:start position:0%
and and also how many people
are

05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
providing that care
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
so the average daily census in
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
home care agencies at least among my
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
members and we have 46 43 agencies that
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
are members is about 10 000 patients on
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
on any given day
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't have handy
 
05:14:44.550 --> 05:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
how many uh employees there are
 
05:14:46.868 --> 05:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
um but it's well over ten thousand in
 
05:14:49.590 --> 05:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
order to care for these staff for these
 
05:14:49.600 --> 05:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
order to care for these staff for these
patients

05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:56.948 --> 05:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
so if these staff are going from house
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
to house
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh providing home care
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh they are
 
05:15:02.878 --> 05:15:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh they are
incredibly

05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
05:15:07.030 --> 05:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh vulnerable are they not to uh
 
05:15:08.788 --> 05:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
infection if they're not protected in
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
some fashion
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes the uh they are um
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable as are their patients
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's why during the pandemic uh
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
ppe was of the you know protective
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
gear was the utmost importance
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
and why we're all so thankful for the
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine but as i mentioned
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
it we totally respect the right of staff
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
who choose not to get the vaccine but we
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
need to be able to know who they are
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
in case um
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
accommodations need to be made
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up madam chair
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
um so the thing is that to the degree
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
patients and staff interacting with lots
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're not only vulnerable but they're
 
05:16:04.868 --> 05:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
also potential vectors
 
05:16:04.878 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
also potential vectors
and

05:16:05.160 --> 05:16:05.170 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:05.170 --> 05:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
dr daly in her testimony
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
i talked about the degree of uh
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
effectiveness efficacy in other words of
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccines in the nursing homes which
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
was contradicted by misconduct testimony
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
so uh i believe that dr diddy was
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
talking about not
 
05:16:26.638 --> 05:16:27.670 align:start position:0%
talking about not
uh

05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:27.680 --> 05:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
uh
not

05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:16:28.480 --> 05:16:29.670 align:start position:0%
not
preventing

05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
05:16:29.680 --> 05:16:31.270 align:start position:0%
preventing
um

05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:33.350 --> 05:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
deaths which is what miss kanye was
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
representatives yes mike i'm answering
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
i'm asking my question madam chair not
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
everything can be said in two words
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh so it to the degree that uh that the
 
05:16:45.120 --> 05:16:46.070 align:start position:0%
uh so it to the degree that uh that the
people

05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:16:46.080 --> 05:16:47.270 align:start position:0%
people
um

05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:49.430 --> 05:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
are being vaccinated
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
now that there's a vaccine
 
05:16:51.280 --> 05:16:52.310 align:start position:0%
now that there's a vaccine
uh

05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
is it not the case that you're having
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
fewer infections as a result in your
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
experience with your clients
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know i really don't have that level
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
of data representative schmidt to be

this amendment
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
i i was born and grew up in communist
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
china as a little child well lined up in
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
government schools without parent
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
consent all choices were lined up and
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
little dots and to get all vaccines that
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
the government wanted us to do
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then we were trapped by household
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
registration system
 
05:18:18.150 --> 05:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
a national id with a booklet you have no
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
privacy at all and in schools then we
 
05:18:20.878 --> 05:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
privacy at all and in schools then we
have

05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
a student file then document everything
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
about you so we were not treated really
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
like a human being supposed to have a
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
little bit privacy zero privacy i mean
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
they could basically come to your home
 
05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
to sit on your bed and talk to you
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
so i come to this country when i was
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
about 24 years old i just was desperate
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
to get out of china because i feel like
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
my life there
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
was not really worth living it was like
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
a little good little slave and if you do
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
something they want to say behave their
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
way they want you to behave you're okay
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
you have okay life but otherwise you
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
can't get locked up and you can
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
disappear i had a little bit brain and
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
intelligence left i was planning to
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
leave for a new country called america
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
but i had to get a
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
permission to even go apply for my
 
05:19:14.550 --> 05:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
passport and i had to you know plan my
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
political strategy to say the things
 
05:19:18.550 --> 05:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
they want me say in order to get the
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
passport so now here we are in this
 
05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
country many years later i am american
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
citizen i'm really worried about the
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
trend that our government is going down
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
our country is going down
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's really not good i'm very terrified
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
worried for our country especially last
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%

05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
for the sake of public health and
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
security we were supposed to obey
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%

i'd like to focus my testimony today on
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment specifically section nine
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
we have serious concerns about this
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendment our mission and our primary
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to the to provide
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
quality care in a safe environment
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and healthcare facilities
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
employ a variety of strategies in order
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
a safe environment and one of those
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
elements of the safe environment is a
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
healthy workforce as paul manahan
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
pointed out we have significant concerns
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
about the exemption
 
05:23:22.320 --> 05:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
about the exemption
as

05:23:23.670 --> 05:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
as provided in the amendment
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
implementing this exemption would
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
be more than an administrative burden
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
for us we really see it as near
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
impossible for the reasons that beth
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
daly pointed to also
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%

the entire state
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%

05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
available to our employees for our
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
annual influenza program these
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions are working
 
05:23:59.520 --> 05:24:00.868 align:start position:0%
exemptions are working
um

05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
we finally i just would like to note
 
05:24:04.550 --> 05:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
that senator bradley highlighted that we
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
are navigating severe workforce
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
challenges when he introduced the the
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
original bill senate bill 155
 
05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to simply move
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
staff around and refute who refuse
 
05:24:20.788 --> 05:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination so we we are
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
significantly concerns about the
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
implications if this amendment were to
 
05:24:23.840 --> 05:24:25.110 align:start position:0%
implications if this amendment were to
pass

05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
we believe that this amendment would
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
significantly impact our ability to
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
staff our hospitals and would therefore
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
impact patient care and access to care
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
we strongly urge this committee to
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
oppose um
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
section 9 of this proposed amendment i'm
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
the committee representative allegra
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you ms tanner for
 
05:24:48.868 --> 05:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
of course i'm going to guess but please
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
answer my my first question then i'll
 
05:24:54.550 --> 05:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
answer follow-up did you just hear miss
 
05:24:56.868 --> 05:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
tang's uh testimony
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
i did have the opportunity to hear her
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
testimony great uh how would you address
 
05:25:01.200 --> 05:25:01.990 align:start position:0%
testimony great uh how would you address
that

05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh how would you address her experience
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
that you described allegro that is also
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
fascinating but i'm not sure it's
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
relevant to the question okay well i'll
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
ask uh another question if i may please
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard plenty of testimony of
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
today of those who would prefer to not
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
receive the vaccination
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
another testimony of many thousands who
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
might not so my question is
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
is there any reticence at all
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
about forcing so many thousands of
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:30.708 align:start position:0%
about forcing so many thousands of
citizens

05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
to be injected with an entirely new form
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
of medication and then force them to
 
05:25:37.190 --> 05:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
produce papers upon the insistence
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
of the government or other private
 
05:25:38.798 --> 05:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
of the government or other private
citizens

05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
how i would respond to that is that we
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
we do roll out an annual influencer
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
program currently at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
health and we do have our employees do
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability to seek religious and
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions so
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're certainly not forcing any
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and the exemptions that we
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
have available to our employees are
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
working well follow up please
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
follow up once that's a question that
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
describes current policy but the policy
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the future that this uh
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment seeks to
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
um protect against is different
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
so i ask again do you have
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
any reticence about forcing so many
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of people to
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
take a new medication that they prefer
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
not to
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think that don't think that's an
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate question okay thank you
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you representative
 
05:26:34.470 --> 05:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
before representative schmidt asked this
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
question ms tanner would you be able to
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
support the subcommittee
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'm happy to make myself available
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spent
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
you already asked my question madam
 
05:26:45.760 --> 05:26:46.550 align:start position:0%
you already asked my question madam
chair

05:26:46.550 --> 05:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for miss
 
05:26:50.160 --> 05:26:53.830 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for miss
tanner

05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
i've seen none i call harrington
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
and kochik
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
for something similar in kasich that's
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
close enough thank you madam chairman
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to testify most of the
 
05:27:07.110 --> 05:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
points that i wanted to make
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
have already been made
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
right and and i'm not
 
05:27:12.550 --> 05:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to be a proponent of
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or
 
05:27:17.670 --> 05:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
or not i think it's taking a vaccine
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
of any type is a personal choice and uh
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
people can do what they need to do there
 
05:27:22.958 --> 05:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
people can do what they need to do there
but

05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
the the the concept of having a
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
requirement to have paperwork of some
 
05:27:28.718 --> 05:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
requirement to have paperwork of some
kind

05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
to show that you have had a vaccine
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
live a normal life
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
it to me is just absolutely foreign and
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
wrong and it's i mean i really resonated
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
with uh lilly williams testimony a
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
couple of people ago
 
05:27:49.110 --> 05:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
citizens should not have to give up
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
personal freedoms to live a normal life
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned earlier that doing
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
this grants special privileges to a
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
certain population while limiting others
 
05:27:58.400 --> 05:28:00.070 align:start position:0%
certain population while limiting others
access

05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not even going to go into the
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
medical concerns that i have on this but
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to come at it from
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
to to me
 
05:28:12.390 --> 05:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
a an issue because it says you have to
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine some people
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
like myself
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
have had covet and so we have natural
 
05:28:20.798 --> 05:28:22.230 align:start position:0%
have had covet and so we have natural
antibodies

05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
antibodies
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
right so why would i need to get a
 
05:28:23.840 --> 05:28:25.350 align:start position:0%
right so why would i need to get a
vaccine

05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:28:28.948 --> 05:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
i i i don't believe i need one uh given
 
05:28:30.788 --> 05:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
that i've had covered which by the way
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
amounted to three days of mild cold
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
symptoms for me
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
texas and florida have already passed
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
similar legislation to what we're
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about here in this amendment
 
05:28:43.548 --> 05:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
and and it's been ruled at as
 
05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional at the federal level
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know so despite the fact that it's
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
being talked about there uh it looks
 
05:28:51.270 --> 05:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
like it's not gonna happen as a
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
nationwide mandate
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh this this particular amendment by the
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
way and reading through it it addresses
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh entities that
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh benefit from state funding in some
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
way my belief is that this amendment
 
05:29:07.190 --> 05:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended so that it expands
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
it to all entities public and private
 
05:29:09.280 --> 05:29:10.868 align:start position:0%
it to all entities public and private
businesses

05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
most of you i'm sure are uh familiar
 
05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
with with rsa what is it 354-a
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
colon 16
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
right which um which which basically it
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
well does it basically it says equal
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
access to public accommodations is a
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
civil right
 
05:29:32.948 --> 05:29:32.958 align:start position:0%
one one of the uh reasons there is is is
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
your creed
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
and others have mentioned exemptions for
 
05:29:37.680 --> 05:29:38.868 align:start position:0%
and others have mentioned exemptions for
religious

05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
religious
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and medical reasons right but to do what
 
05:29:43.990 --> 05:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about doing with any sort
 
05:29:45.910 --> 05:29:45.920 align:start position:0%

confirming that you've had a vaccination
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
is in violation of existing state law
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
05:29:55.190 --> 05:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment should be expanded to all
 
05:29:55.200 --> 05:29:56.830 align:start position:0%
this amendment should be expanded to all

here
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to the bill i
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
apologize i may have been called earlier
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
but i was called away to a
 
05:31:56.788 --> 05:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
different hearing but i'm glad i had the
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
we object to this
 
05:32:01.200 --> 05:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
we object to this
because

05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
essentially it's the state inserting
 
05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
itself into private sector businesses
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
and telling them what they can and
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
cannot do
 
05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of ensuring a safe
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh and healthy workplace for their
 
05:32:16.638 --> 05:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh and healthy workplace for their
employees

05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements are already common
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the health care industry for for the
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
influenza flu vaccine and employers
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are some people
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that may
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh prefer not to be vaccinated for re
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
religious or or medical reasons and they
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
are exempted from this in fact i think
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
even employees
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
who may not want to take it for
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
any reason can can request an exemption
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
they will most likely be required to
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
wear masks but in today's environment
 
05:32:57.110 --> 05:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's wearing a mask anyway
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
so my primary point is um please
 
05:33:03.670 --> 05:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
resist the urge to tell private sector
 
05:33:03.680 --> 05:33:04.868 align:start position:0%
resist the urge to tell private sector
employers

05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
employers
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
what they can and and cannot do to try
 
05:33:09.990 --> 05:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
and ensure a safe workplace for their
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
employees and their customers and then i
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
know it was mentioned earlier but i want
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
to emphasize there's already a house
 
05:33:15.920 --> 05:33:16.948 align:start position:0%
to emphasize there's already a house
position

05:33:16.948 --> 05:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
on this issue it's house bill 220 which
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
has passed the house
 
05:33:20.878 --> 05:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
has passed the house
and

05:33:21.750 --> 05:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:23.910 --> 05:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
is now in the senate and it goes further
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
than this bill
 
05:33:27.750 --> 05:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
it relates to all vaccines not just
 
05:33:31.030 --> 05:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
coven 19 and it relates to all employers
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
not just those employers
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
that may have a contract with the state
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
so it it
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
seems somewhat senseless for me for for
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
this committee to be considering
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
this um
 
05:33:45.990 --> 05:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
more limited
 
05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
amendment when you've already passed a
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill there's already a house position on
 
05:33:51.670 --> 05:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
this issue uh thank you madam chair i'd
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
i have one if you're opposed to the
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
amendment why are you
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that house bill 220 is okay
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're opposed to house bill 222 madam
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i i was just
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
using that by way of let making sure the
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee understood that this issue has
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
already been addressed by the house
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%

quite closely
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
i've read the non-germane amendment
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
quite closely that's what that's that's
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%

05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%

so uh does it strike you that the that
 
05:34:49.680 --> 05:34:50.628 align:start position:0%
so uh does it strike you that the that
the

05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's what we're talking
 
05:34:52.480 --> 05:34:53.350 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's what we're talking
about

05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
is uh is quite comprehensive and would
 
05:34:56.320 --> 05:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
is uh is quite comprehensive and would
effectively

05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh impose these restrictions on
 
05:35:02.788 --> 05:35:02.798 align:start position:0%
a great majority of new hampshire
 
05:35:02.798 --> 05:35:05.110 align:start position:0%
a great majority of new hampshire
businesses

05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
well it uh thank you for the question
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt i i believe so i
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:35:13.750 --> 05:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how many private sector
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
businesses contract with the state but i
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
suspect it could be in the thousands i
 
05:35:22.628 --> 05:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
asked commissioner arlinghaus that
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
question and he also was unsure but
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
speculated that it was a thousand or
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
more so it is certainly a lot of private
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
sector employers
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
so do you think the bill is workable in
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
05:35:39.360 --> 05:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
terms of the
the

05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions it would impose on
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh on the businesses that it would it
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that it would impact
 
05:35:51.910 --> 05:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
our fundamental objection to the
 
05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
is that is the state inserting itself
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
into the private sector
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
and telling employers what they can and
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
cannot do
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to maintain a safe
 
05:36:06.708 --> 05:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
and healthy environment for their
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
employees and their customers i'm not
 
05:36:08.718 --> 05:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
employees and their customers i'm not
sure

05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
how you go about fixing that unless it's
 
05:36:15.910 --> 05:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
to remove the section relating to
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
private sector employers
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:36:20.320 --> 05:36:22.470 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
representative

05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you mr gervais
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question does the state
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
insert itself into private business
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
matters in other fair areas
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question
 
05:36:35.200 --> 05:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question
um

05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
and in many
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
cases there are many examples with other
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation i can think of that the bia
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
is also opposed for example we opposed a
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory requirement for paid family
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
leave we were certainly in favor of a
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
voluntary program we were opposed to
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh mandatory
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh payment for accrued but unused
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
vacation time and there are probably a
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
number of other areas where the state
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
has tried to tell private sector
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
businesses how to best run their
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
businesses and we are generally in
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to those
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:21.030 --> 05:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr gervais for taking my
 
05:37:22.958 --> 05:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr gervais for taking my
question

05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
these variants are becoming more
 
05:37:28.160 --> 05:37:29.830 align:start position:0%
these variants are becoming more
communicable

05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
communicable
 
05:37:31.590 --> 05:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
don't you think businesses have the
 
05:37:31.600 --> 05:37:32.788 align:start position:0%
don't you think businesses have the
right

05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
to protect their employees not only uh
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
just the employees themselves but also
 
05:37:39.030 --> 05:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
their businesses
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh we know at
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
isn't there evidence that once uh
 
05:37:46.310 --> 05:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
one employee contracts uh covert 19 that
 
05:37:48.150 --> 05:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
it could spread throughout the business
 
05:37:50.470 --> 05:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
shutting down that business for
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
days and costing a loss of revenue for
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
that business thanks representative
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
goalie and it's nice seeing you again by
 
05:37:58.150 --> 05:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
the way i miss not seeing you on the
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
labor committee uh yeah i think that is
 
05:38:03.190 --> 05:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
a very real world concern that employers
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
have and i might add
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the bia supported legislation that
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
both the house and senate have decided
 
05:38:10.320 --> 05:38:11.190 align:start position:0%
both the house and senate have decided
to

05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
park or back burner relating to
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
establishing a legal safe harbor for
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
businesses who are doing the right thing
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and complying with with federal and
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
state um health and safety guidelines
 
05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
both chambers have decided that issue
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
needs more study
 
05:38:31.110 --> 05:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
so businesses are are not only concerned
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
about what's in the best interest of
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
their employees and their customers but
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're also concerned about potentially
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh not being able to implement something
 
05:38:42.868 --> 05:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
now and then end up being sued over it
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:46.548 --> 05:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
 
05:38:46.558 --> 05:38:51.030 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
committee

05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:38:54.470 --> 05:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you members of the
 
05:38:54.480 --> 05:38:55.590 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you members of the
committee

05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
testify on the amendment to senate bill
 
05:39:00.080 --> 05:39:11.350 align:start position:0%
testify on the amendment to senate bill
155

05:39:11.350 --> 05:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again i'm margaret burns
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire municipal
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
association nhma is opposed to the
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment and to be clear we
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
do not have a position relative to
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccines but along the same
 
05:39:30.150 --> 05:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
lines uh with of the testimony from the
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
bia we do oppose legislation that
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
supplants local authority and decision
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
making with state mandates and puts new
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
requirements on cities and towns section
 
05:39:43.030 --> 05:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
10 of the amendment prohibits a
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
political subdivision not only from
 
05:39:48.070 --> 05:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
requiring a person to receive a vaccine
 
05:39:51.270 --> 05:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
or provide proof of a vaccine even more
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
concerning it would prohibit a political
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
subdivision from contracting with a
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
private business that requires vaccines
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
or proof of vaccines and then treats a
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
violation of that provision as a breach
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
of contract that would render the
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
contract voidable
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
this creates an interference with local
 
05:40:13.628 --> 05:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
decisions and it's a burdensome
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility because as i read it it
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
would require municipalities to somehow
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
monitor the actions of private
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and employers with respect to
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines so that they could then take
 
05:40:27.910 --> 05:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
that into consideration when deciding
 
05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
whether they are able to enter into
 
05:40:32.628 --> 05:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
various service contracts with private
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
vendors and businesses with respect to
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
the section on outdoor dining
 
05:40:40.470 --> 05:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
i won't reiterate the concerns that i
 
05:40:43.270 --> 05:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
expressed in the senate bill 155 hearing
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
they remain the same the language is
 
05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
very very similar the only additional
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
thing i would say is that the amendment
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
obviously makes the extension of outdoor
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
dining permanent and it would seem more
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
prudent to go the route of senate bill
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
155 which does the extension through
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
2023 and allows there to be some kind of
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
assessment before that time period runs
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
out about whether it should be extended
 
05:41:11.670 --> 05:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
further so we are opposed to the
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment and that concludes
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
my testimony thank you
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
all right team now thank you very much
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
testify on the amendment to senate bill
 
05:41:28.718 --> 05:41:35.270 align:start position:0%

05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
all right see none i will close the
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%

and we will take up the
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment to senate bill 133
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
in five minutes
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%

05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all for coming welcome to edna

05:48:56.548 --> 05:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
a non-german amendment to senate bill
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.150 --> 05:49:06.160 align:start position:0%

the non-jermaine amendment number 1162
 
05:49:17.840 --> 05:49:18.948 align:start position:0%
the non-jermaine amendment number 1162
h

05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
h
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
deals with the qualifications to be an
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
associate teacher in a child care
 
05:49:23.760 --> 05:49:25.350 align:start position:0%
associate teacher in a child care
program

05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
these three lines were in bill
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:49:29.200 --> 05:49:30.708 align:start position:0%
house bill
230

05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
230
 
05:49:32.948 --> 05:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
that this committee retained earlier
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
this year house bill 230 dealt with
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
several areas of child care licensing
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is very narrow and only
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
deals with one section of the bill
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
i am bringing this before you today for
 
05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
your consideration because child care
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
programs are facing a crisis
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
and not being able to hire for vacant
 
05:49:56.878 --> 05:49:58.548 align:start position:0%
and not being able to hire for vacant
positions

05:49:58.548 --> 05:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:50:01.110 --> 05:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment would just add
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
an additional pathway for people to
 
05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
become employed in child care programs
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
as a as associate teachers
 
05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
after house bill 230 was retained
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
i had several child care providers reach
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
out to me and ask me
 
05:50:20.470 --> 05:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to have a bill
 
05:50:20.480 --> 05:50:22.070 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to have a bill
retained

05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
retained
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
those of us in the legislature of course
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
understand that language but to
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
the public it's not not quite so clear
 
05:50:32.310 --> 05:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i explained to them that if the bill
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be dealt with
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
um later in the session and that we
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
would probably not
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
see the bill out
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
and becoming law until
 
05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
a year from now
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
but the hiring crisis is now and child
 
05:50:46.958 --> 05:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
but the hiring crisis is now and child
care

05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
programs need our assistance
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
i know you will hear from child care
 
05:50:55.350 --> 05:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
licensing who will tell you they are
 
05:50:58.470 --> 05:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
doing this now through waivers and this
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
will continue until the state of
 
05:51:02.310 --> 05:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
emergency ends
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
but none of us know when that will be
 
05:51:08.788 --> 05:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
but when it does end
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
child care providers will still need the
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility in hiring
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
will this solve all the problems in
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
hiring employees in child care
 
05:51:20.788 --> 05:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
this just offers another pathway to
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
enter the field
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
the employment solutions for child care
 
05:51:30.070 --> 05:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
are ongoing
 
05:51:32.788 --> 05:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
and it will take a long-range plan and
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
lots of action to accomplish the kinds
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
of workforce we need in child care this
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is only a small piece to a
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
bigger puzzle but it will help in the
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
short term
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
with more and more fat people returning
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
to work child care
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
is an important support for both parents
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
and children
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
you will hear from child care programs
 
05:51:59.590 --> 05:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
that because of the hiring crisis there
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
are programs closing
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
and many are not accepting the number of
 
05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
children they cared for before the
 
05:52:06.160 --> 05:52:09.030 align:start position:0%
children they cared for before the
pandemic

05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
a shortage of child care
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
will provide barriers to many people
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
trying to return to work
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
an adequate supply of child care is an
 
05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
important part of building a strong
 
05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
economy this amendment
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
is one small piece in providing child
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
care that is needed by our new hampshire
 
05:52:28.000 --> 05:52:29.110 align:start position:0%
care that is needed by our new hampshire
families

05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your consideration of
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment and i know this committee
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
has done a lot of work on child care
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
licensing and i appreciate all the work
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
you have done and i appreciate the
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee and the chair persons allowing
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
me to bring forth this amendment today
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
and i am open to questions
 
05:52:50.230 --> 05:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you margaret questions
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative lucas uh thank you madam
 
05:52:52.718 --> 05:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
representative lucas uh thank you madam
chair

05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:52:53.760 --> 05:52:54.788 align:start position:0%
chair
um

05:52:54.788 --> 05:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm generally supportive of this idea
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
but i have a couple of questions just to
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
put it uh in context the first one is um
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
without this what are the current
 
05:53:10.470 --> 05:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for someone like this to um
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
become licensed so you know current
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirements versus what this would put
 
05:53:18.070 --> 05:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
in place
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
i believe the current i i no longer work
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
day every day in the child care field
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
even though i was a child care provider
 
05:53:27.190 --> 05:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
for over 45 years
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
um but i believe currently
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the rules
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
you need
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
nine college credits
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be an associate teacher
 
05:53:39.840 --> 05:53:39.850 align:start position:0%
though the um
 
05:53:39.850 --> 05:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
though the um
[Music]

05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
department the licensing
 
05:53:45.110 --> 05:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
bureau did reach out to me and informing
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they are providing waivers to that
 
05:53:49.350 --> 05:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
05:53:52.310 --> 05:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
so something very similar
 
05:53:52.320 --> 05:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
so something very similar
to

05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment is happening now
 
05:53:59.350 --> 05:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh by waiver and it will last
 
05:53:59.360 --> 05:54:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh by waiver and it will last
through

05:54:00.470 --> 05:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:54:00.480 --> 05:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
through
the

05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:03.350 --> 05:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
05:54:03.360 --> 05:54:04.548 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
my

05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:54:06.548 --> 05:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that at the end of the
 
05:54:08.948 --> 05:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
state of the emergency
 
05:54:10.628 --> 05:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
it will still be
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
very difficult for child care programs
 
05:54:14.000 --> 05:54:15.110 align:start position:0%
very difficult for child care programs
to

05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
hire staff and that they will need they
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
will need this in place
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
for for the future
 
05:54:23.040 --> 05:54:24.150 align:start position:0%
for for the future
follow-up

05:54:24.150 --> 05:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:54:26.948 --> 05:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
okay the other question is um
 
05:54:31.030 --> 05:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is uh being put in uh 178 170 11
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
which is rule making
 
05:54:36.150 --> 05:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the other things in here tend to be
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
general areas that the commissioner
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
should adopt rules for
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
whereas this seems to be
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
setting up um you know sort of another
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
path for certification
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if remember off hand
 
05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
just where that is in the rsas just
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
wondering why it ended up in this
 
05:54:53.520 --> 05:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
wondering why it ended up in this
section

05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
um i was not the i i actually was not
 
05:55:02.310 --> 05:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the original bill um
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 230 and i only i took this
 
05:55:10.470 --> 05:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
language directly from 230 so i think um
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that representative williams
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
is here and she might be able to speak
 
05:55:16.708 --> 05:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:55:16.718 --> 05:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
to that
um

05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:20.628 --> 05:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
and it's not william
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
and she's the next person to speak okay
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.920 --> 05:55:26.868 align:start position:0%
 
any

05:55:26.868 --> 05:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:55:32.310 --> 05:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will wait until
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and members of the

you're welcome uh i'm here to
 
05:56:40.230 --> 05:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly in support of uh
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
adding this amendment to support child
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
care facilities and our
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
working parents and children who require
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
child care during the day
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
as representative walner mentioned
 
05:56:55.270 --> 05:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're currently dealing with a staffing
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
crisis for child care facilities across
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
um the problem is not the money i i know
 
05:57:04.948 --> 05:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
we've heard this in previous testimony
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee that the
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
problem was the money the problem now is
 
05:57:11.670 --> 05:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
not the money there are quite a bit of
 
05:57:13.110 --> 05:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds that have been
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
specifically earmarked for child care
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
facilities for things like staffing and
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
ppe during this pandemic the problem
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
that we're running into the roadblock we
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
have right now
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
is this requirement of education for
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
associate teachers
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
and yes there is a waiver but it's still
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
a roadblock for advertising the position
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
and attempting to get people to
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
interview and be hired for these open
 
05:57:37.920 --> 05:57:39.030 align:start position:0%
interview and be hired for these open
positions

05:57:39.030 --> 05:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:57:40.948 --> 05:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
so we're obviously seeing the ripple
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
effects of not having the staff that we
 
05:57:46.470 --> 05:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
need for child care facilities this
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
means that
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
in working families one parent or in
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
some cases single parent families the
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
parent is having to choose between
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
staying home with the kids
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
or making life decisions that may alter
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
their career for the long term because
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
we can't support them
 
05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
through child care in new hampshire so
 
05:58:07.110 --> 05:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal we're at the pinch point
 
05:58:07.120 --> 05:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal we're at the pinch point
now

05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so to address the question that was
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
addre that was asked to representative
 
05:58:12.160 --> 05:58:13.270 align:start position:0%
addre that was asked to representative
walner

05:58:13.270 --> 05:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
walner
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
our issue really is because the omnibus
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
child care bill that i had sponsored
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
previously ended up being retained by
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
and we are in a pinch point we had to
 
05:58:25.350 --> 05:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
find a senate bill that could
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
potentially be amended in order to carry
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so this is the bill that it was
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
added to so that's the the answer to the
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
question is this is the closest we could
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
find it's been amended and added
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
in in an effort to try to preserve and
 
05:58:39.920 --> 05:58:40.948 align:start position:0%
in in an effort to try to preserve and
save

05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
save
 
05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
as many staff as
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
industry right now
 
05:58:46.470 --> 05:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
and actually representative mc williams
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
the question wasn't why senate bill 133
 
05:58:53.430 --> 05:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
like you say it seems fairly appropriate
 
05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
the question is why is this under rule
 
05:58:58.558 --> 05:58:59.830 align:start position:0%
the question is why is this under rule
making

05:58:59.830 --> 05:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:59:01.910 --> 05:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
for um
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
specifically in the licensing for
 
05:59:05.920 --> 05:59:06.868 align:start position:0%
specifically in the licensing for
uh

05:59:06.868 --> 05:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:59:06.878 --> 05:59:10.548 align:start position:0%
uh
personnel

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.558 --> 05:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
oh you mean the way that it's amending
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
the statute is that what you're getting
 
05:59:18.310 --> 05:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
at i'm sorry i just need to clarify
 
05:59:18.320 --> 05:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
at i'm sorry i just need to clarify
um

05:59:20.470 --> 05:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:20.480 --> 05:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
um
if

05:59:22.150 --> 05:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
it needs to go under licensing rather
 
05:59:29.350 --> 05:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
than rulemaking it could be moved
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
but it still works under rulemaking
 
05:59:39.990 --> 05:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
represent representative blackis does
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%

05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%

selected for head start scholars
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
as a former director of child care
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
centers i identify
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
totally with the directors
 
06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
and others who support this bill
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
hiring and keeping good workers has
 
06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
always been a challenge
 
06:02:01.030 --> 06:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
for decades and i understand the
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
magnitude of today's
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
crisis in child care
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
directors absolutely want to keep their
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
doors open they want to serve working
 
06:02:10.160 --> 06:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
doors open they want to serve working
families

06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
families
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
noble reasons indeed and ones that we
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
should be able to fulfill
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
in a healthy well-funded truly equitable
 
06:02:21.750 --> 06:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
child care
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
06:02:25.510 --> 06:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that's not what we
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
have in our country and that's why i'm
 
06:02:31.590 --> 06:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
we all know that our child care system
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
has been broken for a long time
 
06:02:38.548 --> 06:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
parents pay too much
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the federal government and other
 
06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
entities not enough
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
child care workers mostly women have
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
been subsidizing the real cost of care
 
06:02:50.948 --> 06:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
for for decades
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
and not only do we have a broken
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
system but we now have kids coming to us
 
06:03:00.470 --> 06:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
with far greater needs than ever before
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
kids are growing up in a highly complex
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
fast-paced confusing world
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
like we've never seen and they bring
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
their reactions to it to child care
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the la
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the least we can do for our staff
 
06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
who care for them often five days a week
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
all day long is to give them the tools
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
that they need to deal with these really
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
tough challenges
 
06:03:29.190 --> 06:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
and the most and one of the most
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
effective tool is education and training
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in
 
06:03:35.590 --> 06:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
child development
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
so when you take away early childhood
 
06:03:37.920 --> 06:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
so when you take away early childhood
training

06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
or the training requirements upon hire
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
you take away the most fundamental tool
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
in that toolbox for that teacher's
 
06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
success to me it just doesn't make sense
 
06:03:56.548 --> 06:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
to take this important tool away
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and also there's some risk
 
06:04:01.910 --> 06:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
because we can't forget that associate
 
06:04:09.670 --> 06:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
teachers are
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to be alone with children based
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
on the licensing standards the ages of
 
06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
children and the numbers of them
 
06:04:17.680 --> 06:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
children and the numbers of them
um

06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:19.840 --> 06:04:21.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and they also was so wait a minute so
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
so also an associate associate teacher
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
can be left alone for the first and last
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
half hour of each day
 
06:04:34.558 --> 06:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
half hour of each day
so

06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
that can be a long 30 minutes when the
 
06:04:37.920 --> 06:04:38.948 align:start position:0%
that can be a long 30 minutes when the
toddler

06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
toddler
 
06:04:40.868 --> 06:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
just pooped in their pants and two
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
preschoolers are fighting
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
but they don't but they could be there
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
with no training at all
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and not only
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
and not until 90 days from higher is an
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
associate teacher required to get basic
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
health and safety training
 
06:05:01.350 --> 06:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
no training involved so eventually
 
06:05:03.750 --> 06:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
they'll get training but in the
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
beginning when they first come in it's
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
pretty risky for them and for the
 
06:05:11.190 --> 06:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
children in their care
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
so some of the solutions
 
06:05:13.840 --> 06:05:14.788 align:start position:0%
so some of the solutions
um

06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just speaking as a retired
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
person so i'm sort of out of out of the
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
the loop but what i do knows is that
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are many excellent groups working
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
on behalf of children in new hampshire
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the unh preschool
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
development grant being one of them
 
06:05:32.718 --> 06:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
development grant being one of them
and

06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
the programs that can work with
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
licensing as mary jane walner mentioned
 
06:05:41.110 --> 06:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
on waivers to get people in the door
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
provided there's a plan
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
to get them credits
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's already being done the council
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
for thriving
 
06:05:49.040 --> 06:05:50.470 align:start position:0%
for thriving
children

06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:05:54.628 --> 06:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
is working on supporting res supporting
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
training with resources and other
 
06:05:56.798 --> 06:05:58.150 align:start position:0%
training with resources and other
supports

06:05:58.150 --> 06:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
supports
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of highly qualified
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
people in the field in new hampshire
 
06:06:08.470 --> 06:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
working on behalf of of supporting
 
06:06:10.948 --> 06:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
supporting providers this problem is not
 
06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
new it's not going to go away
 
06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
and i just encourage um everybody to try
 
06:06:19.430 --> 06:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
to continue working
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
working together on this issue
 
06:06:25.750 --> 06:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
caring for children is hard work kids
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
come to care with an array of unmet
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
needs and caregivers are given the task
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
of meeting those needs day after day
 
06:06:36.470 --> 06:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
for this reason alone never before has
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
it been as important as it is now to
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
support our caregivers with quality
 
06:06:45.030 --> 06:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
education and training so that they have
 
06:06:46.708 --> 06:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
the tools that they need to be
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
successful in their work with young
 
06:06:49.200 --> 06:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
successful in their work with young
children

06:06:50.390 --> 06:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
i urge you
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing and support
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
children and their caregivers by
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you

will you take some questions oh yes i
 
06:07:04.160 --> 06:07:07.830 align:start position:0%
will you take some questions oh yes i
will

06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
um miss jewel do you have an idea of the
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
06:07:17.590 --> 06:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
day care centers that are closing
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.558 --> 06:07:23.670 align:start position:0%
 
find

06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
find
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
employees for them
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know an exact number but i do
 
06:07:30.390 --> 06:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
06:07:30.400 --> 06:07:32.788 align:start position:0%
know it's
rising

06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
rising
 
06:07:36.230 --> 06:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i do feel having been in the field
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
for almost 50 years
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:45.030 --> 06:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
we have to face the fact that we do have
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
a broken system
 
06:07:51.510 --> 06:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
06:07:58.548 --> 06:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
how do you resolution solve that problem
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
well the solutions i'm sorry could you
 
06:08:02.708 --> 06:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
repeat your question yeah you
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
recommended some solutions to the to the
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
issue of day care and i wanted to know
 
06:08:08.708 --> 06:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
how those
 
06:08:10.868 --> 06:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
resolve the problem the immediate
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
problem of funding day care because this
 
06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
is a immediate problem for new hampshire
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
families right
 
06:08:20.708 --> 06:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
i think working with
 
06:08:23.590 --> 06:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
licensing is an immediate
 
06:08:26.708 --> 06:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
problem i think working with
 
06:08:28.868 --> 06:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
the council for thriving
 
06:08:28.878 --> 06:08:30.390 align:start position:0%
the council for thriving
children

06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:08:32.948 --> 06:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
for just offering some supports can be
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
an immediate problem it's a short-term
 
06:08:35.680 --> 06:08:36.708 align:start position:0%
an immediate problem it's a short-term
fix

06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
fix
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
i quite frankly think
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
that we still have to work on
 
06:08:45.670 --> 06:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
on on getting
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
the whole system
 
06:08:49.830 --> 06:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
fixed in child care we can't keep
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
putting band-aids on it
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that for 50 years
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
and it keeps getting harder
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
so i think at some point
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
and whether it takes centers
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
closing or closing classrooms because
 
06:09:08.150 --> 06:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are no teachers
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
to get more people involved with this
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
i have no further questions thank you
 
06:09:18.878 --> 06:09:20.948 align:start position:0%
i have no further questions thank you
representative

06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:09:23.830 --> 06:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
dr jewell for taking my question i'm
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
going to piggyback on what
 
06:09:30.150 --> 06:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative grota was talking about
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
06:09:34.390 --> 06:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
you and i agree philosophically
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
and i admire the what you you've said
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
about how we can best
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
care for children who are in poverty
 
06:09:44.708 --> 06:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
that comprises a portion of my district
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
06:09:47.990 --> 06:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
philosophically i'm with you and here's
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:09:51.750 --> 06:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
to get out of a different angle of what
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative grota was asking you know
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
for for this
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
amendment it would only affect as i
 
06:10:01.990 --> 06:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand it correct me if i'm wrong um
 
06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
the entry level
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
workers who currently would be required
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
to take
 
06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
some coursework at the higher education
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
level or post
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
secondary level
 
06:10:18.548 --> 06:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
to work in a child care center
 
06:10:18.558 --> 06:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
to work in a child care center
so

06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
for the entry-level position that this
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
would affect
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't they gain that same
 
06:10:31.030 --> 06:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
um level of understanding and continuing
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
education credits are not
 
06:10:37.510 --> 06:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
excluded they would still be required
 
06:10:39.270 --> 06:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
06:10:42.310 --> 06:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
to since we have what you said maybe it
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to shut down some
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
some child care centers i i look at it
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
from my constituents point of view that
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of folks face the crisis
 
06:10:54.948 --> 06:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
of losing their child care and having no
 
06:10:54.958 --> 06:10:56.310 align:start position:0%
of losing their child care and having no
options

06:10:56.310 --> 06:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
options
 
06:10:58.948 --> 06:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
and giving a pathway
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know i could see as a career
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
position to someone who's called to this
 
06:11:05.990 --> 06:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of work wouldn't this enable
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
folks who haven't yet
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
achieved any post-secondary education to
 
06:11:12.000 --> 06:11:12.948 align:start position:0%
achieved any post-secondary education to
choose

06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
choose
 
06:11:16.390 --> 06:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
child care work as a career path that
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise wouldn't be available to them
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
since that's all
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
this amendment would affect as those
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
entry-level folks
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
says that make sense
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess but i i don't unders
 
06:11:31.920 --> 06:11:32.948 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess but i i don't unders
i

06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
first of all this yes this is an entry
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
level position for an associate teacher
 
06:11:42.390 --> 06:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
which is one down from a lead teacher
 
06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
so and again stressing that an associate
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
teacher is allowed to be alone with
 
06:11:47.600 --> 06:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
teacher is allowed to be alone with
children

06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:11:49.840 --> 06:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
children
so

06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's an important piece
 
06:11:53.760 --> 06:11:54.788 align:start position:0%
i think that's an important piece
um

06:11:54.788 --> 06:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:54.798 --> 06:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
um
i

06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:11:55.920 --> 06:11:57.270 align:start position:0%
i
i

06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
i agree with what you're saying
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
especially because they can get on or
 
06:12:05.350 --> 06:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
they do they are required to receive 18
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
credit 18 hours of
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.430 align:start position:0%
credit 18 hours of
training

06:12:09.430 --> 06:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:12:12.390 --> 06:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
a year ongoing once they're hired so
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
they will get training
 
06:12:14.558 --> 06:12:15.910 align:start position:0%
they will get training
so

06:12:15.910 --> 06:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:18.788 --> 06:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
but why can't they come in the door and
 
06:12:22.230 --> 06:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
get with a weight waiver from licensing
 
06:12:24.470 --> 06:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
that says as long as there's a plan in
 
06:12:24.480 --> 06:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
that says as long as there's a plan in
place

06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
to get nine credits
 
06:12:28.878 --> 06:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
to get nine credits
in

06:12:29.910 --> 06:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
early childhood development or something
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
okay madam chair i think i have a
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
question then for the amendment authors
 
06:12:42.470 --> 06:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
if that's okay
 
06:12:44.070 --> 06:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
relevant to
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
the same
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:12:50.070 --> 06:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
williams or walnut would you care to
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
answer this question
 
06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i can
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
i have to hear it first
 
06:12:59.830 --> 06:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i i hear dr jewell's um
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
concern about unsupervised
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
um care
 
06:13:04.958 --> 06:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
um care
um

06:13:05.910 --> 06:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:09.190 --> 06:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
is i thought that
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
at least for this
 
06:13:10.878 --> 06:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
at least for this
um

06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
entry level
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
to ch the way the amendment is written i
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
thought that correct me if i'm wrong
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
they would be under supervision
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
constantly and not allowed to be alone
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the kids
 
06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
what how is
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
how should i interpret the amendment the
 
06:13:31.830 --> 06:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
way it's written
 
06:13:34.628 --> 06:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
no the amendment the amendment
 
06:13:36.788 --> 06:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
addresses the qualifications to be an
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
associate teacher
 
06:13:40.150 --> 06:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the first part of the admit and the
 
06:13:40.160 --> 06:13:41.830 align:start position:0%
and the first part of the admit and the
first

06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
part of it is that you have to have a
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
thousand hours of super revised child
 
06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
care experience
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
so someone who is working
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
um now in a child care center they don't
 
06:13:56.230 --> 06:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
have the nine credits
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
but they would work and gain the
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
thousand hours under the supervision of
 
06:14:05.350 --> 06:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
a lead teacher probably
 
06:14:07.750 --> 06:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
and they would also have to have 30
 
06:14:09.670 --> 06:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
hours of training
 
06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
in child growth and development
 
06:14:12.558 --> 06:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
in child growth and development
um

06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
the latter of which at least in the
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
amendment it could be some documented
 
06:14:21.430 --> 06:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
life experience for instance
 
06:14:24.150 --> 06:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
if someone had been a family child care
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
provider in their own home
 
06:14:27.830 --> 06:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
and provided
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
care for children in their own home
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
that might be a very relevant life
 
06:14:32.878 --> 06:14:34.150 align:start position:0%
that might be a very relevant life
experience

06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:14:34.160 --> 06:14:34.530 align:start position:0%
experience
um

06:14:34.530 --> 06:14:34.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:34.540 --> 06:14:36.548 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
so then after they had completed after
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
after they had completed the thousand
 
06:14:43.910 --> 06:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
hours of supervised
 
06:14:45.990 --> 06:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
they would then be able to be an
 
06:14:48.548 --> 06:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
associate teacher and yes they could be
 
06:14:48.558 --> 06:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
associate teacher and yes they could be
alone

06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
alone
 
06:14:51.990 --> 06:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
with a class of children they would
 
06:14:54.548 --> 06:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
still have to meet the child care
 
06:14:54.558 --> 06:14:56.310 align:start position:0%
still have to meet the child care
ratios

06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
ratios
 
06:15:00.310 --> 06:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
so if let's say it was um two-year
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
a group of two-year-olds there would be
 
06:15:06.548 --> 06:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
one adult for every five to six children
 
06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
um so as an associate teacher she or he
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
might be there with five or six children
 
06:15:14.000 --> 06:15:15.670 align:start position:0%
might be there with five or six children
for

06:15:15.670 --> 06:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe the entire day
 
06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
maybe just early in the morning when
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
staffing is
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
there are fewer children and you need
 
06:15:27.190 --> 06:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
staff to cover maybe later in the
 
06:15:27.200 --> 06:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
staff to cover maybe later in the
afternoon

06:15:28.390 --> 06:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
but this does give you the flexibility
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
of having people
 
06:15:32.400 --> 06:15:33.190 align:start position:0%
of having people
um

06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:36.390 --> 06:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
come in get work for the thousand hours
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
get the 30 hours have the 30 hours of
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
child growth and development training
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
and then be able to be an associate
 
06:15:42.878 --> 06:15:45.270 align:start position:0%
and then be able to be an associate
teacher

06:15:45.270 --> 06:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:48.868 --> 06:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:50.470 --> 06:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
there are other questions from it ms
 
06:15:50.480 --> 06:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
there are other questions from it ms

ask you may ask another question thank
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
you so hearing what um representative
 
06:16:18.470 --> 06:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
walner said in clarifying
 
06:16:19.830 --> 06:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
have you
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
do you feel less lenient in your
 
06:16:27.910 --> 06:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
position or more lenient
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that question i i
 
06:16:33.270 --> 06:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
understand it's my understanding
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
that that that 30 hours could
 
06:16:38.948 --> 06:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
is could be interpreted
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
any way that you want
 
06:16:44.470 --> 06:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes it could be as a child as a family
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
child care provider but it could be
 
06:16:47.440 --> 06:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
child care provider but it could be
um

06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:50.788 --> 06:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
no i mean i don't mean this in a
 
06:16:53.590 --> 06:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
derogatory way in by any
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
means but it could be
 
06:16:59.110 --> 06:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
raising raising children at home
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding how the language
 
06:17:01.840 --> 06:17:02.548 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding how the language
is

06:17:02.548 --> 06:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i think in
 
06:17:07.110 --> 06:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know so it's open we have to my
 
06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding honestly it's an
 
06:17:13.350 --> 06:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
open interpretation
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
but the thousand hours is specified it's
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding that it is
 
06:17:22.470 --> 06:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
under supervised
 
06:17:24.150 --> 06:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the license
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
child care setting supervised care so
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
that turns out to be about six months of
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
roughly full-time
 
06:17:31.680 --> 06:17:32.868 align:start position:0%
roughly full-time
um

06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
work in a child care program
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:40.310 --> 06:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:43.830 --> 06:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%

testimony today
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
i am the state manager for save the
 
06:18:00.708 --> 06:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
children action network and i have the
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
honor to represent over 3 000
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh supporters and volunteers across the
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
06:18:08.708 --> 06:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
um at say the children action network we
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
believe all children deserve access to
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
high quality early childhood education
 
06:18:15.430 --> 06:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
since 2014 we have worked in partnership
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
with community volunteers policy
 
06:18:19.830 --> 06:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
advocates and state legislators to
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
improve accessibility and quality of new
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's child care and early
 
06:18:25.590 --> 06:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
learning programs
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
while well intentioned we do believe the
 
06:18:30.150 --> 06:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to senate bill 133 would be a
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
step backward in our mission to provide
 
06:18:34.390 --> 06:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
equitable access to high quality early
 
06:18:36.070 --> 06:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
childhood education to all granite
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
staters which is why i am testifying in
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to this amendment
 
06:18:41.990 --> 06:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
early childhood educators are
 
06:18:43.430 --> 06:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
06:18:45.510 --> 06:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
the care and education of our youngest
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
citizens during some of the most
 
06:18:49.350 --> 06:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
consequential years in their lives
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
while they provide essential service to
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
working families and help shape the
 
06:18:54.070 --> 06:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
leaders of tomorrow
 
06:18:55.990 --> 06:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
they are a routinely undervalued
 
06:18:56.000 --> 06:18:57.430 align:start position:0%
they are a routinely undervalued
workforce

06:18:57.430 --> 06:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 133
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment seeks to answer this
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
shameful undervaluing of teachers by
 
06:19:05.910 --> 06:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
lowering the bar for higher education
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
required of child care employees
 
06:19:10.628 --> 06:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
early childhood educators that i have
 
06:19:12.150 --> 06:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
worked closely with in my role
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand that their jobs are
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult as our state
 
06:19:17.670 --> 06:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
copes with multiple crises impacting
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
children including the opioid epidemic
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the cova 19 pandemic
 
06:19:23.910 --> 06:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
more children are coming into their care
 
06:19:26.070 --> 06:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
with adverse childhood experiences
 
06:19:27.910 --> 06:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the aforementioned
 
06:19:27.920 --> 06:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
associated with the aforementioned
crises

06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
crises
 
06:19:31.750 --> 06:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
child care providers should be supported
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
by the state with more resources and
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
trainings to help them provide high
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
quality care i think answering these
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
crises by diminishing teacher education
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
requirements would be a grave mistake
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that could negatively impact generations
 
06:19:45.590 --> 06:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
of granite staters
 
06:19:47.990 --> 06:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
even setting our public health crises
 
06:19:49.590 --> 06:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
aside the quality of care of our
 
06:19:52.470 --> 06:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
children is a direct reflection of the
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
competence of the early childhood
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
educator and we should not consider
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
compromising the health and safety of
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
our children under any circumstances
 
06:20:03.270 --> 06:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i urge members of this
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee not to support this amendment
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 133 and i am happy to
 
06:20:10.708 --> 06:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
take any questions you may have
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for the
 
06:20:16.948 --> 06:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
work that you
 
06:20:16.958 --> 06:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
work that you
missed

06:20:18.470 --> 06:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
missed
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and i think philosophically you and i
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
agree i think what's difficult tell me
 
06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
 
06:20:25.040 --> 06:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
aren't

06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't we have such a crisis in getting
 
06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
enough caregivers
 
06:20:34.830 --> 06:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
and isn't this a very narrow
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
um way to help us get folks that do have
 
06:20:41.910 --> 06:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
applicable experience in the door
 
06:20:45.190 --> 06:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
without needing post-secondary education
 
06:20:45.200 --> 06:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
without needing post-secondary education
but

06:20:46.310 --> 06:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:20:48.070 --> 06:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
i mean don't you think this would be
 
06:20:51.030 --> 06:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
since it's so narrow it's not addressing
 
06:20:53.670 --> 06:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
continuing education credits it's not
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
addressing the other levels of child
 
06:20:58.470 --> 06:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
care providers wouldn't this be a great
 
06:21:01.030 --> 06:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
career path say for
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
a person who has had many kids or is an
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
immigrant who's been
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
is eager to get
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
um in this field couldn't this be seen
 
06:21:13.910 --> 06:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
as a career path
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
of entry
 
06:21:18.150 --> 06:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
for folks who don't fit the mold
 
06:21:18.160 --> 06:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
for folks who don't fit the mold
currently

06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think when we talk about child care
 
06:21:24.400 --> 06:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
i think when we talk about child care
and

06:21:25.190 --> 06:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
early childhood education
 
06:21:29.910 --> 06:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
my belief and the
 
06:21:31.830 --> 06:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
mission of my organization is to promote
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
equitable access to
 
06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
the highest quality of care
 
06:21:38.788 --> 06:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
and i just think that
 
06:21:40.628 --> 06:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
any kind of diminishing of those
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
standards of care
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
just having a teacher there
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
and child care available for families
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
who may need it um
 
06:21:49.360 --> 06:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
who may need it um
doesn't

06:21:50.390 --> 06:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily a huge help to
 
06:21:55.030 --> 06:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
families when that care isn't high
 
06:21:56.868 --> 06:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
quality and isn't setting that child up
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
for for success
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from miss
 
06:22:03.280 --> 06:22:04.390 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from miss
johnson

06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
johnson
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
miss johnson um if your mission is to
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
provide the highest quality of care
 
06:22:16.080 --> 06:22:18.470 align:start position:0%
provide the highest quality of care
available

06:22:18.470 --> 06:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
how do we do that in a state like new
 
06:22:20.080 --> 06:22:21.190 align:start position:0%
how do we do that in a state like new
hampshire

06:22:21.190 --> 06:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
i meet your mission statement how does
 
06:22:25.590 --> 06:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
that because those are
 
06:22:26.948 --> 06:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
06:22:29.430 --> 06:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
i would think that is a sliding scale
 
06:22:29.440 --> 06:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
i would think that is a sliding scale
correct

06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:22:33.990 --> 06:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i would i mean i would echo some of
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
my um
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
karen jewell who
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
testified previously that
 
06:22:44.230 --> 06:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
we do have a broken system
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
but that
 
06:22:47.190 --> 06:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
i know from my work that there's no
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
shortage of organizations and
 
06:22:50.948 --> 06:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
individuals on the ground who care
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
deeply about this issue
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
and so while i don't have a fully baked
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
solution to offer you today i think
 
06:23:00.470 --> 06:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know many of the organizations
 
06:23:02.470 --> 06:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier who are working on
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of kids
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
are working towards better solutions to
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
the very real crises
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we're facing i just don't believe
 
06:23:12.310 --> 06:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
that this amendment uh
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
is the solution and i just want to add i
 
06:23:14.718 --> 06:23:15.670 align:start position:0%
is the solution and i just want to add i
think

06:23:15.670 --> 06:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:23:17.750 --> 06:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know when we talk about teacher
 
06:23:20.070 --> 06:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
shortages at other levels of education
 
06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
this isn't a solution that's
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
routinely offered and so i
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
frankly don't understand why this would
 
06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
be a solution
 
06:23:31.030 --> 06:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
other than if we're considering early
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
childhood education in some way
 
06:23:33.440 --> 06:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
childhood education in some way
less

06:23:34.470 --> 06:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
less
 
06:23:36.470 --> 06:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
important than other levels of education
 
06:23:38.230 --> 06:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
which i of course don't believe it is i
 
06:23:38.240 --> 06:23:39.030 align:start position:0%
which i of course don't believe it is i
think

06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
these are teachers who are caring for
 
06:23:42.470 --> 06:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
children during the most formative years
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
of their lives when the most brain
 
06:23:47.270 --> 06:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
development is happening at the most
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
rapid pace throughout their lifetime so
 
06:23:50.708 --> 06:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:23:52.628 --> 06:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
these teachers should be well trained
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
and taking a step backward in that
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
regard isn't
 
06:23:59.670 --> 06:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.310 --> 06:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:24:08.160 --> 06:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
we hear that the situation's in crisis
 
06:24:14.628 --> 06:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's a broken it's banning after
 
06:24:17.910 --> 06:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
band-aid and so forth
 
06:24:19.830 --> 06:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
when we when will we see the results
 
06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about from all the
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
efforts you're describing to try to
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
address the situation when we're going
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
to see those
 
06:24:29.350 --> 06:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.360 --> 06:24:30.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:33.270 --> 06:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure i have an answer for
 
06:24:35.830 --> 06:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
you i know
 
06:24:38.470 --> 06:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know there are many different
 
06:24:41.830 --> 06:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
grants and programs underway
 
06:24:44.548 --> 06:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
i don't i think this is a
 
06:24:46.628 --> 06:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
something that we do need to
 
06:24:48.708 --> 06:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
apply more focus and resources to
 
06:24:48.718 --> 06:24:49.910 align:start position:0%
apply more focus and resources to
address

06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
address
 
06:24:52.628 --> 06:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
the broken system as i see it
 
06:24:55.110 --> 06:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i have an answer for when
 
06:24:57.750 --> 06:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
all the issues will be fixed but i i do
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
hope that we can continue to work on
 
06:24:59.600 --> 06:25:00.948 align:start position:0%
hope that we can continue to work on
this

06:25:00.948 --> 06:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:25:07.670 --> 06:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.680 --> 06:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

06:25:10.230 --> 06:25:10.240 align:start position:0%

me speak my name is marion barter i'm
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
the executive director at merrimack
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
valley daycare service and blueberry
 
06:26:02.788 --> 06:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
express day care um in the concord area
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think i i'd like to
 
06:26:07.750 --> 06:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
say that i support this bill
 
06:26:09.670 --> 06:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
or this amendment i don't think it's
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
ideal i don't think anyone thinks the
 
06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
idea of changing qualifications for
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
teachers is ideal but the reality is
 
06:26:20.310 --> 06:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
that we cannot hire and when we can't
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
hire class when we can't hire staff to
 
06:26:25.350 --> 06:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
work in our classrooms
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
we can't serve the families that are
 
06:26:30.230 --> 06:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
calling us up and begging for spaces and
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
as much as i appreciate karen and
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
emily's view that you know this will
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
diminish the field and it's better
 
06:26:39.190 --> 06:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's better to close child care
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities i i can't fathom what good
 
06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
could come of that
 
06:26:45.990 --> 06:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
my agency works primarily with
 
06:26:48.150 --> 06:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
low-income families so our mission is to
 
06:26:50.230 --> 06:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
care for children at risk of abuse and
 
06:26:52.708 --> 06:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
neglect low-income families and children
 
06:26:55.350 --> 06:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
with special needs and right now my wait
 
06:26:56.868 --> 06:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
list is long enough to open up a whole
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
nother child care facility and if i
 
06:27:01.590 --> 06:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
could hire i could take these children
 
06:27:03.270 --> 06:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the reality of the situation of the
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
children that i care for is that if i do
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
not offer them a space in my licensed
 
06:27:11.670 --> 06:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
facility where they are supervised by
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
myself by a team of teachers and by
 
06:27:17.510 --> 06:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
child care licensing it's going to be
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
the next door neighbor or mom's
 
06:27:21.270 --> 06:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
boyfriend or someone they met on
 
06:27:23.110 --> 06:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
craigslist who will be caring for these
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
children and that's devastating and for
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
the first time in our 50-year
 
06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
career our agency has been around since
 
06:27:34.150 --> 06:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
1968 and for the very first time i find
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
myself in a situation where i am
 
06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
waitlisting children who are in the dcyf
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
system you know i'm wait listing foster
 
06:27:42.868 --> 06:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
children and i
 
06:27:46.468 --> 06:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
i just find that an incredible shame and
 
06:27:46.478 --> 06:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
i just find that an incredible shame and
really

06:27:47.750 --> 06:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
what this
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
what this amendment will do is give me
 
06:27:54.070 --> 06:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
just a slim chance that i may be able to
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
hire some people and i may be able to
 
06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
help some of those families it's not
 
06:28:00.230 --> 06:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
ideal no one thinks it's ideal and
 
06:28:01.750 --> 06:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
honestly if
 
06:28:03.990 --> 06:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
someone would want to consider it for a
 
06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
sundowning that i i think that we would
 
06:28:07.910 --> 06:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
encourage that too because there are a
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
innovations that are starting to come
 
06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
out to bring people to the field but it
 
06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
will take a couple years for that to
 
06:28:16.548 --> 06:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
happen and i'm not sure how many of us
 
06:28:18.628 --> 06:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
will still be standing in a couple years
 
06:28:18.638 --> 06:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
will still be standing in a couple years
so

06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:28:20.548 --> 06:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for letting me
 
06:28:23.030 --> 06:28:23.040 align:start position:0%

i think i'll take any questions take a
 
06:28:24.558 --> 06:28:25.430 align:start position:0%
i think i'll take any questions take a
question

06:28:25.430 --> 06:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:28:25.440 --> 06:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
question
certainly

06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%

06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
point for the future of young families
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%

child care providers are facing in
 
06:30:23.190 --> 06:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
hiring staff
 
06:30:24.868 --> 06:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
the department has provided relief to
 
06:30:27.030 --> 06:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
the staffing crisis by implementing an
 
06:30:29.430 --> 06:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
expedited waiver process as of november
 
06:30:32.868 --> 06:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
23 2020 to allow assistant teachers to
 
06:30:34.708 --> 06:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
work as associate teachers throughout
 
06:30:36.310 --> 06:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
06:30:39.590 --> 06:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
on november 24th we approved 56 requests
 
06:30:41.670 --> 06:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
received on that first day
 
06:30:44.230 --> 06:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
as of april 23rd the department has
 
06:30:46.868 --> 06:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
approved 225 requests from child care
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
providers so that 502 assistant teachers
 
06:30:52.390 --> 06:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
can work as associate teachers
 
06:30:54.390 --> 06:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
currently the child care provider can
 
06:30:56.468 --> 06:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
hire someone who does not meet the
 
06:30:58.948 --> 06:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
requirements in rule to work as an
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
associate teacher during this state of
 
06:31:00.718 --> 06:31:02.788 align:start position:0%
associate teacher during this state of
emergency

06:31:02.788 --> 06:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request that the staff
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications remain in rulemaking and
 
06:31:09.110 --> 06:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
therefore we are testifying in
 
06:31:11.590 --> 06:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to this amendment we are on
 
06:31:13.510 --> 06:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
schedule to submit revised rules to the
 
06:31:14.948 --> 06:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
administrative rules also known as jail
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
card in this september
 
06:31:20.948 --> 06:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
the revisions have been informed by the
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
testimony the department has heard in
 
06:31:25.750 --> 06:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
regards to hb 230 as well as feedback we
 
06:31:27.670 --> 06:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
received over four zoom meetings with
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
providers since october of 2020 the most
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
recent meeting held earlier this month
 
06:31:34.948 --> 06:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
in addition to staff qualifications
 
06:31:36.948 --> 06:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
providers and the department identified
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
other changes were needed therefore we
 
06:31:41.350 --> 06:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
will be putting forth a comprehensive
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
revision to our existing rules we
 
06:31:45.350 --> 06:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the draft rule will be
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
sent to providers in may to receive
 
06:31:49.830 --> 06:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
additional input prior to engaging in
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
the formal rulemaking process
 
06:31:55.590 --> 06:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
we also heard in the testimony to hb 230
 
06:31:56.868 --> 06:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
that there are providers who are
 
06:31:58.948 --> 06:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about reducing educational
 
06:32:00.548 --> 06:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
requirements much like you've heard
 
06:32:00.558 --> 06:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
requirements much like you've heard
today

06:32:01.510 --> 06:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we are working on balancing both
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
perspectives and the revised rules to
 
06:32:08.548 --> 06:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
accomplish flexibility and quality the
 
06:32:10.548 --> 06:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which includes the
 
06:32:12.390 --> 06:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing and the hearing before
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
gel car provides additional feedback
 
06:32:16.390 --> 06:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
from the providers to the department on
 
06:32:19.350 --> 06:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
both perspectives
 
06:32:21.430 --> 06:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
should the state of emergency end prior
 
06:32:23.270 --> 06:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the revised rules going in front of
 
06:32:25.510 --> 06:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
jail car we are committed to continuing
 
06:32:27.430 --> 06:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
this waiver process and are actively
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
working with our legal counsel on how to
 
06:32:31.990 --> 06:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish allowing the existing waivers
 
06:32:34.628 --> 06:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
to for assistant teachers to remain in
 
06:32:36.628 --> 06:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
effect until the revised rules are in
 
06:32:36.638 --> 06:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
effect until the revised rules are in
place

06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:32:39.270 --> 06:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
we encourage programs to continue to
 
06:32:40.708 --> 06:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
reach out for waivers and we are
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
committed to working with them to
 
06:32:45.270 --> 06:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
provide a safe environment for children
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the specific amendment
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
section 1 lines 9-10 includes the
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
provision to allow documented life
 
06:32:55.270 --> 06:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
experience to be substituted for 30
 
06:32:56.868 --> 06:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
hours of training in child growth and
 
06:32:59.350 --> 06:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
development should the committee decide
 
06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
to approve the amendment the department
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
respectively requests that the committee
 
06:33:04.788 --> 06:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
put forth a definition of life
 
06:33:07.190 --> 06:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
experience that would be an equivalent
 
06:33:09.430 --> 06:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
to 30 hours of training in child growth
 
06:33:10.628 --> 06:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
and development
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
in accordance with professional
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
standards the domains of child growth
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
and development include the
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
developmental milestones from birth
 
06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
through age eight years related to the
 
06:33:22.230 --> 06:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
physical cognitive social and emotional
 
06:33:24.070 --> 06:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
development of children
 
06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
as currently written the department is
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
uncertain how we could equitably
 
06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
regulate the provision without what is
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
also known as oral rulemaking where
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're deciding on a case-by-case basis
 
06:33:36.390 --> 06:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
if someone's life experience is the
 
06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent to 30 hours of child growth
 
06:33:41.270 --> 06:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
and development training
 
06:33:42.628 --> 06:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
and with that i
 
06:33:44.150 --> 06:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
ask if you have any questions i'd be
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them thank you for
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you miss clement
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:34:00.708 --> 06:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
proposal that you're going to be
 
06:34:03.270 --> 06:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
presenting to jail car
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
does it have any other
 
06:34:08.230 --> 06:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
rules that have been discussed with this
 
06:34:10.468 --> 06:34:10.478 align:start position:0%
committee does it include other
 
06:34:10.478 --> 06:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
committee does it include other
rules

06:34:11.750 --> 06:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
06:34:13.830 --> 06:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes it includes um a lot of the
 
06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard throughout hb
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
230 we are looking at that testimony and
 
06:34:21.590 --> 06:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
seeing where our rules can be changed in
 
06:34:24.390 --> 06:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
order to assist providers in providing
 
06:34:25.830 --> 06:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
the care that they need to care that
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
they need to in order to have their
 
06:34:28.080 --> 06:34:29.110 align:start position:0%
they need to in order to have their
business

06:34:29.110 --> 06:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:34:31.110 --> 06:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
we recognize throughout that testimony
 
06:34:32.548 --> 06:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
and throughout those additional meetings
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we've had with providers since
 
06:34:37.190 --> 06:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
october that the rules in general just
 
06:34:39.190 --> 06:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be looked at again to make
 
06:34:40.788 --> 06:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
sure they were clear to make sure that
 
06:34:42.468 --> 06:34:42.478 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
06:34:44.548 --> 06:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
implemented by programs and to make sure
 
06:34:46.150 --> 06:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
that we weren't unduly burdening
 
06:34:47.910 --> 06:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
programs so we are
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
revising our rules based on looking at
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
06:34:54.788 --> 06:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you miss miss clement
 
06:34:56.628 --> 06:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
i believe that several members of the
 
06:34:58.390 --> 06:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee would like to receive those
 
06:35:00.390 --> 06:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
rules when you send them out for initial
 
06:35:02.468 --> 06:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
comments so if you could do that i'd
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yes absolutely we'll send
 
06:35:06.390 --> 06:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
them to the committee
 
06:35:08.548 --> 06:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:35:08.558 --> 06:35:12.628 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

06:35:12.628 --> 06:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:15.030 --> 06:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
miss clement can you tell me is this are
 
06:35:21.110 --> 06:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
states getting federal money to address
 
06:35:23.750 --> 06:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
this child care issue new new money for
 
06:35:23.760 --> 06:35:25.430 align:start position:0%
this child care issue new new money for
that

06:35:25.430 --> 06:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
i can speak
 
06:35:29.030 --> 06:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
terms but i am not the agency that
 
06:35:31.750 --> 06:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
receives those funds the funds come
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
through the
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development head
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
start collaboration in the department of
 
06:35:39.510 --> 06:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services through the
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
child development block grant
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
so they would they are receiving funds
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i know that money it has been
 
06:35:49.030 --> 06:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
earmarked to address the staffing issue
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
however i can't really speak to the
 
06:35:52.468 --> 06:35:52.478 align:start position:0%
specifics as to how much that is because
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
that isn't a different agency and i
 
06:35:56.708 --> 06:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to put forth any numbers that
 
06:35:58.868 --> 06:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
would not be accurate so can you just
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
tell me who it is again
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um the bureau of child
 
06:36:06.230 --> 06:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
development and head start collaboration
 
06:36:07.750 --> 06:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
 
06:36:07.760 --> 06:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
services

06:36:09.030 --> 06:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:36:09.990 --> 06:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:36:11.910 --> 06:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
for administering the child care
 
06:36:18.150 --> 06:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:20.468 --> 06:36:20.478 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
06:36:20.478 --> 06:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
yes

06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:36:23.990 --> 06:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:36:25.510 --> 06:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i see that this
 
06:36:25.520 --> 06:36:26.708 align:start position:0%
so i see that this
amends

06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
amends
 
06:36:30.310 --> 06:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
rsa 170e 11 part 1
 
06:36:30.320 --> 06:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
rsa 170e 11 part 1
which

06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
has various general areas of rule making
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department supposed to engage in my
 
06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
question is
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have any place else in statute
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
related to
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for training for
 
06:36:45.670 --> 06:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
being involved in child care
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
where there's uh in statute
 
06:36:50.070 --> 06:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
particular requirements of number of
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
hours of experience or training or
 
06:36:54.390 --> 06:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
it is not under the child care statute
 
06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
all of that information is contained in
 
06:37:01.990 --> 06:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules um which is hec
 
06:37:02.000 --> 06:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules um which is hec
4002

06:37:03.990 --> 06:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
4002
 
06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that is where all those specifics are
 
06:37:07.350 --> 06:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's not there's not a
 
06:37:08.788 --> 06:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
specific section in the statute
 
06:37:10.948 --> 06:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
regarding the tr the number of hours of
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
training or the educational requirements
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
there is in the statute a voluntary
 
06:37:17.190 --> 06:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing system which is
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
administered under the bureau of child
 
06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
development and head start collaboration
 
06:37:24.468 --> 06:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
but that is a voluntary
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary program and in statute it
 
06:37:30.070 --> 06:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
references that the first level of any
 
06:37:32.390 --> 06:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing system is the equivalent
 
06:37:34.468 --> 06:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
to what is in the child care licensing
 
06:37:34.478 --> 06:37:43.830 align:start position:0%
to what is in the child care licensing
rule

06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:53.830 --> 06:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:56.230 --> 06:37:56.240 align:start position:0%

that um for the record my name is lisa
 
06:38:03.990 --> 06:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
rampas i am a resident of allens town in
 
06:38:06.390 --> 06:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm also the executive
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
director of the child study and
 
06:38:09.110 --> 06:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
development center at the university of
 
06:38:11.030 --> 06:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which is a lab school on
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
the campus of unh
 
06:38:16.628 --> 06:38:16.638 align:start position:0%
um i had a prepared testimony but i know
 
06:38:17.990 --> 06:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
that it's been a long day and i just
 
06:38:19.590 --> 06:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to add to some of the comments that
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
have has already been said by some of my
 
06:38:21.840 --> 06:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
have has already been said by some of my
colleagues

06:38:23.030 --> 06:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
um being in the field for over 20 years
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
 
06:38:30.628 --> 06:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue i think it's uh
 
06:38:32.150 --> 06:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
because we're in a pandemic and child
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
care is getting attention
 
06:38:33.760 --> 06:38:34.390 align:start position:0%
care is getting attention
that

06:38:34.390 --> 06:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:38:36.708 --> 06:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
we are seeing more than we have been in
 
06:38:37.750 --> 06:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the past
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
um but i do think in opposition to this
 
06:38:42.548 --> 06:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
bill that the
 
06:38:46.310 --> 06:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
the continuous um response of lowering
 
06:38:49.110 --> 06:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications is unacceptable
 
06:38:51.590 --> 06:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
as emily stated earlier we would never
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
do that to the department of education
 
06:38:56.948 --> 06:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
teachers why do we continuously do it to
 
06:38:58.390 --> 06:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
early childhood
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
um i have the privilege of working with
 
06:39:03.430 --> 06:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
interns i teach two internship courses
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
here at the university and i see how
 
06:39:09.510 --> 06:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
practical application makes an impact on
 
06:39:11.670 --> 06:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
who one becomes as a teacher
 
06:39:13.990 --> 06:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
i also can attest to the students who
 
06:39:17.030 --> 06:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
come out of our program are gobbled up
 
06:39:17.040 --> 06:39:18.788 align:start position:0%
come out of our program are gobbled up
by

06:39:18.788 --> 06:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:39:22.468 --> 06:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
other programs and unfortunately um
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
it it does have a bit to do about money
 
06:39:27.270 --> 06:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
when you have good pay and benefits
 
06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to get better staff and
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately early childhood isn't
 
06:39:33.270 --> 06:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
there yet however
 
06:39:35.670 --> 06:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
it can't always be about the barriers so
 
06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
what do we do about it and yes there are
 
06:39:39.750 --> 06:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
programs in our state right now the
 
06:39:42.788 --> 06:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program the teach program
 
06:39:44.468 --> 06:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
that are making strides
 
06:39:46.390 --> 06:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
and yes it will take some time before
 
06:39:47.750 --> 06:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
06:39:50.788 --> 06:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
um i also have the privilege to sit on a
 
06:39:53.190 --> 06:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
well-represented um
 
06:39:55.670 --> 06:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretty new committee if you will looking
 
06:39:57.830 --> 06:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
at alternative pathways because i
 
06:39:59.990 --> 06:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
believe strongly that people need
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
education and training and how do we
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
provide that we have these gems called
 
06:40:07.350 --> 06:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
lab schools in our states that many have
 
06:40:09.990 --> 06:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
been closing let's look at how they can
 
06:40:13.270 --> 06:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
provide training um or even types of
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
residency programs or apprenticeship
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
programs to allow people to get the
 
06:40:20.310 --> 06:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
training and then go out into the field
 
06:40:22.868 --> 06:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying okay let's give a
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
waiver and melissa clement that is not a
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
dig on you you are doing an outstanding
 
06:40:28.628 --> 06:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
job so thank you for what you do every
 
06:40:29.830 --> 06:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
single day
 
06:40:29.840 --> 06:40:30.708 align:start position:0%
single day
um

06:40:30.708 --> 06:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
but we can't continue to just
 
06:40:36.628 --> 06:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
minimize things how do we hold that high
 
06:40:38.628 --> 06:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
standard because of the impact it has on
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
young children emily stated that well so
 
06:40:44.150 --> 06:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
i don't need to to reiterate that
 
06:40:46.708 --> 06:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
um things like you know module-based
 
06:40:49.110 --> 06:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
learning where they have some coaching
 
06:40:52.150 --> 06:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
and some pre-work and after work
 
06:40:54.390 --> 06:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
um years ago in our state with the
 
06:40:57.350 --> 06:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
quality dollars through the cdbg grant i
 
06:40:59.030 --> 06:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
think i could be wrong there so please
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
don't quote me um we were able to access
 
06:41:05.430 --> 06:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
education through wheelock college um
 
06:41:06.788 --> 06:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
mary jane walnut you might be able to
 
06:41:09.430 --> 06:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
speak to this perhaps but i was so
 
06:41:11.110 --> 06:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be part of one of the
 
06:41:13.350 --> 06:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
cohorts that went through that i would
 
06:41:15.030 --> 06:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
not have had the opportunity to get a
 
06:41:17.830 --> 06:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
master's program without that
 
06:41:19.590 --> 06:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it so it was grant
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
funded the teachers came to us it was
 
06:41:21.600 --> 06:41:22.788 align:start position:0%
funded the teachers came to us it was
amazing

06:41:22.788 --> 06:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
06:41:24.628 --> 06:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
and the thing that i had going for it
 
06:41:26.948 --> 06:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
was a cohort model so people were
 
06:41:29.030 --> 06:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
learning together and i'm still in
 
06:41:31.430 --> 06:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
contact with all of most of my cohort
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
members even today and we graduated you
 
06:41:36.548 --> 06:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
know back in 20 2007
 
06:41:38.468 --> 06:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
so all i'm trying to say is that there
 
06:41:40.708 --> 06:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
are ways that we can provide
 
06:41:43.110 --> 06:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
education and training if we just think
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
outside the box look at what works and
 
06:41:48.070 --> 06:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
look at best practice thank you so much
 
06:41:50.230 --> 06:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
for hearing me today and i'm hoping for
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any
 
06:41:56.468 --> 06:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
representative seems to have a question
 
06:41:59.190 --> 06:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
so these programs that are available in
 
06:42:03.430 --> 06:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire through all these
 
06:42:06.070 --> 06:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
are they do they cost someone money do
 
06:42:07.670 --> 06:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
you pay for them
 
06:42:09.750 --> 06:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
so there are scholarship based programs
 
06:42:11.350 --> 06:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge and there
 
06:42:12.788 --> 06:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
might be people on this call who could
 
06:42:15.590 --> 06:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
speak better to that um but so for
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
example they get a scholarship to get
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
the training i believe that's all free
 
06:42:21.750 --> 06:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
they get paid a wage in the teach
 
06:42:23.670 --> 06:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
program they're working for another
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
program every time they meet a milestone
 
06:42:27.830 --> 06:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
they get a bump and pay and so they're
 
06:42:30.830 --> 06:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
getting education experience and more
 
06:42:33.350 --> 06:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
money follow up
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:38.948 --> 06:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
many advocates
 
06:42:45.670 --> 06:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:49.350 --> 06:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
and they all recognize a problem
 
06:42:55.830 --> 06:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:58.150 --> 06:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
why is that that you may not be able to
 
06:43:00.150 --> 06:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
answer that call but i i'd like the
 
06:43:02.548 --> 06:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
people who have spoken to us
 
06:43:03.990 --> 06:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question or the
 
06:43:07.430 --> 06:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
comment i think
 
06:43:10.948 --> 06:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
it costs money quality costs money and
 
06:43:13.990 --> 06:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
if we want to provide a system of early
 
06:43:16.150 --> 06:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
childhood that meets the needs of all of
 
06:43:18.070 --> 06:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
our children in new hampshire it's going
 
06:43:20.230 --> 06:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
to cost money but yet the return on
 
06:43:22.948 --> 06:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
investment has been proven over and over
 
06:43:24.390 --> 06:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
and over
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
through many studies that have already
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
happened in in years past
 
06:43:31.030 --> 06:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
if we provide the money up front there's
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
less crime there's less um special
 
06:43:36.070 --> 06:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
education there's there's
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
less everything that costs money in the
 
06:43:40.310 --> 06:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
long run if we just put it into early
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
childhood but it takes qualified people
 
06:43:45.910 --> 06:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to work with those children
 
06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
not just anyone understands child
 
06:43:50.230 --> 06:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
development so when you know children
 
06:43:52.070 --> 06:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
have temper tantrums or what's called
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
temper tantrums no we can't view it like
 
06:43:56.548 --> 06:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
that all behavior
 
06:43:59.670 --> 06:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
is a communication of some kind it's our
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
job to figure out what those children
 
06:44:02.948 --> 06:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
are trying to say what they're
 
06:44:04.948 --> 06:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
struggling with and provide them
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
strategies that will impact them
 
06:44:09.270 --> 06:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
positively socially and emotionally to
 
06:44:11.830 --> 06:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
be well productive citizens as they get
 
06:44:11.840 --> 06:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
be well productive citizens as they get
older

06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:19.910 --> 06:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:21.430 --> 06:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you for your
 
06:44:23.990 --> 06:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much is there
 
06:44:26.468 --> 06:44:26.478 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
06:44:29.350 --> 06:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment to senate bill 133
 
06:44:42.310 --> 06:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
senator schultz
 
06:44:45.430 --> 06:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're not testifying you've been asking
 
06:44:45.440 --> 06:44:46.628 align:start position:0%
you're not testifying you've been asking
questions

06:44:46.628 --> 06:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:44:48.868 --> 06:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair i was trying to
 
06:44:51.030 --> 06:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
i never have quite the graceful way to
 
06:44:53.910 --> 06:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
bring up a related issue so i just sent
 
06:44:56.390 --> 06:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
to miriam to forward to all of us on
 
06:45:01.030 --> 06:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
edna a report a study report from 2019
 
06:45:01.040 --> 06:45:02.070 align:start position:0%
edna a report a study report from 2019
that

06:45:02.070 --> 06:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:04.830 --> 06:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
includes recommendations that
 
06:45:08.948 --> 06:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
um that this amendment is similar to
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
and includes and it was a study
 
06:45:13.830 --> 06:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee made up of two democrats and
 
06:45:16.310 --> 06:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
two republicans in
 
06:45:18.468 --> 06:45:18.478 align:start position:0%
in the house and senate total
 
06:45:18.478 --> 06:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
in the house and senate total
um

06:45:19.510 --> 06:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:23.670 --> 06:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it is a review of barriers to the
 
06:45:25.670 --> 06:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
child care business which is an
 
06:45:29.910 --> 06:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
interesting angle to look at it and um i
