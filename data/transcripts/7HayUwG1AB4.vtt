to8 years it's probably going
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
up we do have um HUD allows each housing
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
authority to set its preferences and

priority of your waiting list um at New
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing we have two priority
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
preferences and that weight time um is
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
now running about 1 to two years and
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
those priority preferences are for
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
applicant with a terminal illness or an

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
now we only can pull from the waiting
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
list as vouchers become available so
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's all based on attrition and the
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
attrition right now is very low all our
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
vouchers are in
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
use attritions very low as people go off
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
the program we can add new households
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
from the waiting
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
list um New Hampshire housing is one one
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
of a couple other housing authorities in
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are what HUD calls
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
shortfall the rents are so high some of
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
the rents are so high that we we have to
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
live within our I'm just say $50 million
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
budget so as our average subsidy cost
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
goes up we have to serve less or start
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
to just slow down we don't anticipate
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
pulling from the waiting list through
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
the rest of this calendar year which
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
will only increase the wait times for
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
the majority of applicants on the
 
00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:51.790 align:start position:0%
the majority of applicants on the
waiting

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
list is that that y um Happ to answer
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions yeah go ahead Senator rich I
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
have two questions I just want to make
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm clear on something you
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
said a terminant ill person has a
 
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
said a terminant ill person has a
two-year

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
weight I mean one to two years right now
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
because of the funding situation we're
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
in Prior years um it was less than a
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
month we were pulling every month I
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're just in you know HUD it's just
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
based on our HUD funding we're we're
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
dependent on the HUD budget he follow up
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead so in a perfect world how would
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
you suggest fixing
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
this well the HUD budget is based on
 
00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:40.350 align:start position:0%
this well the HUD budget is based on
Congressional

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations we haven't seen basically
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
many new vouchers appropriated through
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
Congress last year we received some
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
vouchers for under um for veterans you
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
know this HUD has what they call special
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
purpose vouchers so you can compete and
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
apply for vouchers as they become
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
available as appropriated by through
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
Congress so as a state that isn't this
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
is you have to talk to the federal
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
delation to ask for them to do
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
something correct it's federally funded
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
dependent on the federal program reach
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
year um does anyone else have any
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
yella hi thank you um
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
so I assume that the um that the waiting
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
list is a Statewide list um and not each
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
18 um agencies have their own list right
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so how or do you no that's just our
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
that's just New Hampshire housing's
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
waiting list each Housing Authority in
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
addition has its own waiting list we may
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
have the same applicants on each other's
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
list but NASA Manchester all each
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority has its own waiting
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
list um okay so you have 12,000 waiting
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
on your list but that's not the entire
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's just us yes that's just you we
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
work Statewide so when I say the
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide waiting list because we
 
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.150 align:start position:0%
Statewide waiting list because we
operate

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
Statewide so how are
 
00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.310 align:start position:0%
Statewide so how are
the

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
11,000 vouchers kind of divvied up are
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
is it equally well I assume it can't be
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
equally since you have almost
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
like a
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
third of the of all of the vouchers so
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
how how is that kind of divvied up and
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
and um so the people on your waiting
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
list are waiting for one of your
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
vouchers that are currently assigned to
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
someone to be not utilized
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
anymore right so HUD allows us to set
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
each housing authority to set its own
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
preference system so like I said we have
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
the two higher preferences and then our
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
next group which we're going to say is
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
the six to eighty year group that is for
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
applicants who are homeless pay more
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
than 50% of their income for rent living
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
in substandard housing victims of
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
veterans they that's the bulk of the
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
waiting list that's the bulk probably
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
eight or ,000 applicants and that and
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
then the rest of the applicants don't
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
have a preference they don't meet any of
 
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.910 align:start position:0%
have a preference they don't meet any of
the

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
above okay
 
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.509 align:start position:0%
above okay
go

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
ahead so um your your choices for
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
preferences um those aren't a Statewide
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
thing right so the 18 other or 17 other
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
um agencies could have other preferences
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
um most have got I'm sorry are you aware
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
of what the any of those preferences are
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
the V uh are there a variety or or do
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
you believe that they're pretty much the
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
same just in speaking with them and we
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
all have to have a HUD approved
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
administrative plan and it's a public
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
document so they all could be looked up
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
from what I hear from the other housing
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
authorities they have simplified their
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
preference system to um some have done
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
away with preferences the local housing
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
authorities often have a residency
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
preference that you come before somebody
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
who if you live in Nashville you might
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
come before somebody who doesn't live in
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
nashwa they can have a residency
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
preference uh had allows that
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
some of the housing authorities um
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
they've tried to simplify their
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
preferences I would say but they they
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
could be similar to ours um the other
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
little kind of information of the
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
preferences regardless of the
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
preferences HUD requires that 75% of the
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
turnover vouchers each year go to
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
applicants who are extremely lwi income
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and those are applicants who are at 30%
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
or below of the area median income limit
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
so regardless of the preference you
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
still have to meet that mandatory
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
vouchers so it's basically um sort of
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
acts like a preference some at times so
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
and I know that conquer do maybe Summers
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
worth they have closed their waiting
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
list because the list becomes so long
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
applicants um go ahead
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative L and could you explain
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
you said that um one of your other
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
priorities are those eligible for the
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
the waiver program and how do those two
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
programs work together the voucher with
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
the waiver program it gives them a
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
preference so if they're eligible in
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
receiving services on one of the four
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver programs which um is
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence nursing home
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
eligible care uh developmentally
 
00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.230 align:start position:0%

injury home support oh home support for
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
children um those four Medicaid waiver
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're just equal status so
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
it's date of application and and their
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um waiver eligibility form okay
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
so it's just a status that they're yeah
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
so they get a higher wait on the waiting
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
list um the right now just for that
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
preference there are over 300 applicants
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
on the waiting list claiming one of
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
those Medicaid waiver
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
programs okay um I have a question um
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
where can we get a list of the um 18 um
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
other agencies we can send that to you
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you it's on our website as well
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
but we'll make it easy and send that to
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you take um the other question
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I i' I'd like you to address is
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
that um can you um give us uh you know I
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh there may be people that watch this
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
um who are unfamiliar with how the
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
vouchers work and my understanding is
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
that there are the housing Choice
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
vouchers which you know you can use to
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
um get an apartment in a private
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
building and the federal government
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
subsidizes your rent um but then there
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
are other vouchers that are specific to
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh um a unit um and how do those work
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um which when we're talking about
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know do you see that we need you
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
know H how how successful are our people
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
at getting suitable Apartments using
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
either housing Choice vouchers or those
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
um those um vouchers that are the
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
Section 8 so the housing trades Voucher
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
Program formerly known as Section 8
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
right and had tried to move away from
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
section 8 and call it the housing Choice
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
voucher program but its brand name is
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
still Section 8 is easy and with the
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
voucher program is exactly what you said
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
you once you get your
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
voucher you go search for an apartment
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
we help with the Housing search but it's
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
the voucher holder's responsibility to
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
find an apartment or they can use it to
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
purchase a home they can rent a
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured home an apartment a duplex
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh an apartment that has to be uh
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
suitable for
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
occupancy be within our rent limits and
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
pass a minimum housing Quality
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
Inspection standard and they lease up in
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
that apartment and we work with those
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
landlords okay we have had um we've been
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
able to lease all our vouchers so really
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
has not been a problem okay the lease up
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the Section 8 when you so we call a
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
voucher a tenant based program where the
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
tenant has the subsidy and the Tenant
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
chooses where they want to live the
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
other program you're describing is
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
really and Ignatius is shop but it's
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
this it's Project based it's the section
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
A Project based program where HUD gives
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
those contracts to the property and
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
ignatius' team they they manage those
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
contracts but it's Project based so if
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
you want to move you can't take the
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
subsidy with you we a voucher you can
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
take it to Florida we have participants
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
they could go all over the country it's
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
transferable so there's this move option
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
that some people prefer to have the
 
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
that some people prefer to have the
choice

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay um can I ask um like
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're mostly interested in um and and
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
this may be um not specific to um the
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
voucher system but um I know that um New
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing also does a lot of
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
data collection on rent rates and Etc um
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
just wondered do you have
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
do you maintain any data of like how
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
many people with disabilities are using
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
these vouchers and well you've given us
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
some but you know what how many how many
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
do we have say say Project based how
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
many do we have how many could we use
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%
and um you know um what are the um I
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
don't know what what are the in
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
incentives are actually building proper
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
properties that will um accommodate
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
people who have physical disabilities or
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
um other
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities so we really without the
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
voucher um there were no new section A
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
contracts HUD HUD um ended that program
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
in the early 80s um 1980s ended that
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
program so there were no new
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
project-based contracts oh okay um so
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
with the vouchers any any housing that
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing developed and
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
finances the owner of that property
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
cannot say no to vouchers so voucher
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
holders can certainly go into any
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
housing um financed and and administered
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire housing okay all right
 
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire housing okay all right
representative

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
lantin do you think that um HUD would
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
consider Project
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
based ones if it was only a portion of
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
the building that's set aside for people
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
with disability say in which they
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
weren't creating a whole building for
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
yep they I guess I should have clarified
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit more on that project base
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's a you can project base vouchers
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
so we actually are allowed by Hud to
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
take some of our
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
vouchers and project base them in one of
 
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.350 align:start position:0%
vouchers and project base them in one of
those

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
properties um and we have done that so
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
we can project base we cannot Project
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
based vouchers for a specific disability
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
it would be a violation of fair
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
housing so it might be people with
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities have it can apply and come
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
from our waiting list and go into those
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
properties but we wouldn't necessarily
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
have a project based vouchers for a
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
project representative
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
yella yes thank you
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
some where that I had heard that if
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
someone got a
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
voucher um that they had trouble
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
finding housing in New Hampshire um that
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
would meet it but then you also stated
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
that all of them are least and so I
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
guess my question is how many of
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
them well I guess it's kind of twofold
 
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.010 align:start position:0%
them well I guess it's kind of twofold
how

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.020 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.310 align:start position:0%
how
[Music]

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
many structures do you believe
 
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.710 align:start position:0%
many structures do you believe
um

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
are currently let's say on the market
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
that fall within
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
your um
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
rent cap right and then also how many of
 
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.149 align:start position:0%
rent cap right and then also how many of
the

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
people uh if any do you have you seen
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
not be able to find housing and they're
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
out in their time frame that they're
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to find it and have to surrend
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
it so those are great questions um I
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how many buildings or
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
properties we have vouchers in we have
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
2100 landlords for the 4,000 or so
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
vouchers so we have you know large
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
properties with multiple voucher
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
participants in it so we have 2100
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
landlords and the success rate which is
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
also measured by Hud how many vouchers
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
does it take to get one lease up and
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's about the success rate is about
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
70% so all our vouchers are in use but
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's because we might issue three
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
vouchers we might notify three people
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
from the waiting list for one voucher
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that two may not be eligible or
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
successful within their Housing search
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
time so they have 120
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
days and then they can ask for an
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
extension um if they need more time but
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
there not everybody is successful either
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
the vulture could expire or
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
they give give give up or you know they
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't find anything it could be uh we we
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
work with each vure holder to track the
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
barriers so what is preventing them from
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
leasing up is it credit is it criminal
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
record is it they need a first floor
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
they need a one-bedroom they have a
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
service animal all you know all the
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
reasons that we work with them through
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
those barriers to want them to be
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
successful with their voucher lease up
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
successful

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
so um I'm interested in if you're
 
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.149 align:start position:0%
so um I'm interested in if you're
tracking

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
um that the let's say that the um
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
the the property is not
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
useful like we've heard a lot about like
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
Universal Design and stuff like that
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
about it's it doesn't have meet their
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
needs as far as they're disabled and
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
they can't um whether it be first floor
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
or some other you know you know curbless
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
shower or something like that that needs
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
um that the that the person would need
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
um if you're tracking those um don't if
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
they have more no we don't track them if
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
they we know like in the um properties
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
financed by New Hampshire housing we
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
know properties financed by New
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing have accessible units
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
in them so we would refer them to apply
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
to these specific propert where we know
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
they might have units that meet their
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
needs they also in the private Market
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
they could make those modifications work
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
with the landlord to make those
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
modifications but we wouldn't we only
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
track we only would know those that we
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
have it as a barrier that they're you
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
know looking for a unit that they need
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
that is um accessible and barrier free
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
we would refer them to the list of
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
Apartments we know about okay and and
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
for someone you notify three people for
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
a single voucher and
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess if the two people that are
 
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.630 align:start position:0%
um I guess if the two people that are
not

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
successful um in 120
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
days do they go back on the waiting list
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
and they get a notified again what they
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
start the search over again or they just
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
off of the list and go back to the end
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
of the line and start you know their
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
sixy year weight over again all that um
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
they if they're actively looking and get
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
an extension we're very generous with
 
00:28:57.679 --> 00:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
an extension we're very generous with
extension

00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
um you can get extension as long as we
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
have a voucher available and through
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
attrition we usually can but they have
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be actively looking in their Housing
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
search because it's holding up another
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
slot in the event that either they go
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
away or we don't hear from them for
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
several weeks or a month we inactivate
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
the their we inactivate their status and
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
then they would have to reapply and go
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
as a follow up on that what if you
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
notify three people that there's a
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
voucher available and two of them are
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
successful in finding apartment then
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
what do you do we would like all three
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
to be sucessful um because then we we
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
have a forecasting tool and we're when
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
the next month we look at attrition and
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
we decide how many slots do we have and
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
then we say oh how many leased up how
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
many didn't how many are searching so
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
every month we have um a forecasting
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
tool that takes us through so so we know
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
maybe this month we pulled 10 people or
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
20 people or no one was successful um
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're living already living
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
in their where they want to stay they're
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
in place so that's easy so we can count
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
on that right away in our forecasting so
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's always looking at who went on who
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
went off and and balancing it HUD gives
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
us the whole calendar year so as long as
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
the end of the calendar year we don't
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
exceed our voucher count you you kind of
 
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
have some wiggle room if you're a little
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
high one month you use through attrition
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
you'll balance yourself
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
out okay um from what I understand HUD
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
uses the area median rent or they they
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
develop some sort of a formula for what
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
they consider a an acceptable price to
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
pay for an apartment do you have what
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
how does that compare with what uh
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
landlords are actually charging so HUD
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
publishes its fair market rents each
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
year effective October 1st they they
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
were just published last um last month
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
for October 1st and housing authorities
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
have 90 days to set what HUD calls a
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
payment standard that's our subsidy
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
standard so we have a fair market rent
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
We compare it to the rent study that you
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
were talking about you know that um New
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing completes each a rent
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
study We compare it to the low-income
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit program rent so we're
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
looking to see what's what is the
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
comparable Market rent and H gives the
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority we have the permission
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
to set that okay between 80 and
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
120% um we have a waiver to 120% some
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
housing authorities can only go to 110%
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
but we have that flexibility to set that
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
as we're trying to set it close to
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
Market because if if we find our success
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
rate dropping we look at the rents okay
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
and then we want to know why aren't they
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
leasing up I this um H only pays us if
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
they lease up so it doesn't do us any
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
good to have a lot of voucher holders
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
searching and they're unable to lease up
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at what are the
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
barriers again if rent's a
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
barrier then um and we can go in some
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
cases we can go over 120% of the fair
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
market rent as a reasonable
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation for an applicant with a
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
disability we have to get approval from
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
HUD Washington okay all right so what
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying is like if um HUD says the
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
or is 100
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
no uh $1,200 a month say is is an
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable rent you're able to go 20%
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
above that and and and have a a voucher
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
that would accommodate that level of
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
rent okay and we're always trying to do
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
that within that $50 million budget so
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
we can't give everybody 120% we wouldn't
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
have enough money so we're looking at
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
setting we're trying to set our payment
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable can you would before we let
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
you go um others may have other
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
questions but who are the people that
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
are coming looking for
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
vouchers so our waiting list is made up
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
mostly um by with people with disability
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
um elderly or they're on the list so
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
long they become
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
elderly um families with
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
children um are really I would say um
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
applicants with a disability make up
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
most of use most of the vouchers and
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
make up most of the waiting
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
list and and how do they come to you oh
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
sorry they uh they can apply through our

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
one okay okay all right representative
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
lontine and then representative
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
yella uh do the private property owners
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
that um rent to these vouches do they
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
also get a tax credit for doing that not
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
not under the voucher program no
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
y well if the city does one it's not
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
through us we wouldn't know about it if
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
the town or city offers some tax
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
incentive we wouldn't know about
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
it but as far as you know they don't get
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
a federal tax no no no not federal for
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
ahead so we had um a
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
people um well you said 300 people are
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
able to accept
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
one of these waivers that are on the on
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
the waiting list so 300 out of the
 
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
the waiting list so 300 out of the
11,000

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
11,000
 
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
11,000
yes

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm just
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm you but you said that there's
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of the people
 
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.750 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of the people
um

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
are either using or on the waiting list
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
um do you have any information about um
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
the whether it's an intellectual or
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
physical disability um
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
or I guess that yeah because there there
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be a lot of
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
um 300 just seems small as out of 11,000
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
if 300 for us is high on that Medicaid
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
waiver yeah yeah um but it could be
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
small but that's just under those
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid W you know that's just really
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver and that mostly when
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
when they come to the top it's usually
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
under the DD waiver the for
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled it's usually
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
that waiver program but everybody else
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
on the waiting list that um says they're
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
disabled by law we can't ask we don't
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
know the nature of their disability so
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
it could be just they receive um
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
SSDI right we've we've been getting a
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
lot of statistics and a lot of them are
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
are are specifically saying like
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled people are in
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the statistics and not essentially all
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
disabled people um and
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
so it seems like your numbers are more
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
going to be in the everyone category and
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
not specifically broken out as far as
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
dis developmentally versus physically
 
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.990 align:start position:0%
dis developmentally versus physically
dis

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
dis
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
right the only one we would know is if
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's a Medicaid waiver it's the only
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
disability we know because they come
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
under that waiver program all right
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much welcome do we have
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
using the federal programs of the

lowincome housing tax credit
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
program the home partnership program
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
Housing Trust Fund and the state
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund and the recently
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
the invest in h money through Bea we've
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
um worked with Bea very closely to get
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
their funds into a lot of the new
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
production that we have been part of um
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
Bea business and economic Affairs okay
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
Taylor Caswell and his team and what I
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
what I wrote down just so you don't have
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
to keep all the notes after this meeting
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
we will send you a grid that explains
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
the programs okay we'll send you our
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
annual report and we'll send you our
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
program plan which if you just look at
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
the multif family information and D's
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
information will be in there it'll give
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
you a good overview so I only prepared
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
notes because once you take a step into
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance it has so many layers of
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
complexity um but think about it when
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
you go for production we have a
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
production program using the the 9%
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
Federal lowincome housing tax credit
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
program which is simple and complicated
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
it gets private investors to put money
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
into the house
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
in exchange for long-term tax credits
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
and other tax benefits and then the home
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
program the Housing Trust Fund program
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then as I said the state affordable
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
housing fund and then the invest in age
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
funds and then there's also debt
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the projects depending
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
on which tax credit program so the 9%
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
simple way to think about it the 9%
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program is
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
designed that the tax credits would Pro
 
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.230 align:start position:0%
designed that the tax credits would Pro
provide

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
70% of the cost of land acquisition
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
engineering approval and actually
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
building the property and then we have a
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
4% tax credit program where 30% of the
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
cost to do all of that is from the tax
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
credits the challenge is that these all
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
come with rental restrictions that are
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
long-term so the short shortest that we
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
do now we do some 30-year but they're
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
primarily 45 years and 60 years that
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
bring income and rent
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions which means the properties
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
cannot support a lot of debt so if I'm
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing Market I'm going to put some money
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
down I'm going to borrow most of the
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
money because I can charge the residents
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
what the market will allow the whole
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
premise of our programs are you limit
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
the the rent amount Andor the income
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
amount which therefore means you can't
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
build it unless you have what they call
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
the capital stack and so you can look at
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
a transaction that might have five
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
different sources in it so might have
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
tax credits home HTF affordable housing
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
Bea and it and each one of those you
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
should know comes with their own
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so on the production side
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
our goal for both production and
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
preservation preservation example
 
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
conquered Royal Gardens up on the
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
heights 300 units had not really been
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
improved for quite a while we did a
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
major um purchase and recapitalization
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
where they're gutting the apartments and
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
bringing them up to more current more
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
current standards but we'll do about a,
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
to 1200 units on both the new production
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the purchase and Rehabilitation side
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason we do a limited number is
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
because the subsidies are limited we get
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
certain allocation from the state we get
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
a certain allocation um from the fed and
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
so we then provide those resources
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
through competitive processes so on the
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit side on
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
the 9% we have a thing called the
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
qualified allocation plan the qap and
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
that sets out the priorities based on
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing priorities but
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
also priorities from the public so we
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
release the qap the qualified allocation
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
plan and we go through quite a process
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
in in that um same thing on the 4% tax
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
credit side we have a notice of funding
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity and then we do operate a
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
separate Supportive Housing Standalone
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
program um which is a rather small
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
program because we cannot use the
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
federal money in in disability specific
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
housing because as my colleague D
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
indicated fair housing has some very
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
significant restrictions on what we can
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
do with HUD resources you should know
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we have spent quite a time banging
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
on Hud's door to say if they could read
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
their regulations in a different way um
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
and they have not been willing to do
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
that even though their regulation says
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
that we should be able to um put forward
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
a fair housing plan to do some specific
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
disability housing but we cannot and it
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
puts a a restriction on both the capital
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
resources and as D also indicated on
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
what we can do in terms of
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
vouchers so in terms of housing for the
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
disabled I would say a couple things one
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
we have certain minimums for Ada
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
American with Disability Act
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
compliance in the competitive process if
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
they agree the developer agrees to do
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
more units we will provide them with
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
more um points which allows them to
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
score and they chase the points um and
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
the like that said the numbers have to
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
work and I'm going to talk about rental
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
assistance because if you built
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
everything without any debt it still
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
will cost $500 to $700 a month to
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
maintain an apartment with insurance
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance utilities upkeep and and the
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
like so even if you put somebody into an
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
apartment that was completely subsidized
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
there are still long-term carrying costs
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
um and as as D indicated the a lot of
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
the folks who are on disability um you
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
know they're making
 
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
$18,000 doll a year and even a third of
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to really support what
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
you need to carry to carry it I will say
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
that within our programs we have this
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
approach of integration is one of our
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
number one approaches in terms of
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
housing for the disabled and it could be
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
disabled folks could be folks from
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
homeless it could be income and again we
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
we lay out okay you get points if you
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
try to serve these different
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
populations and then the overlay is you
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't want folks just living integrated
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
if there aren't Services if they need
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
services so part of what we do if
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
somebody gets points for some of these
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
categories we ask what's your service
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
plan so that people are successful
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
because that's what everybody wants is
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
them to be successful now we do some
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
Standalone support of housing we're just
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
about to go to our board with the notice
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
of funding opportunity for Supportive
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
Housing but it's small dollars
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking this year it's a
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
million and a half to $2 million which
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
is not a lot of money and that's because
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
we can only use the State dollars fair
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
housing won't let us use the federal
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and and that has been a
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
challenge because there a lot of really
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
good organizations trying to build that
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
disability specific housing but we
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
cannot get past the HUD fair housing um
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
requirement uh let me just go through my
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
notes the other thing that to go to
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative latin's question about
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
tax credits the the complicated answer
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
is it is possible that somebody is
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
getting tax credits developer comes in
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
wants to do a 9% tax credit deal they
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
have agreed um as part of that that
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
they'll accept folks with disabilities
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
they'll accept folks with with vouchers
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
so that so they're not directly because
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
of that getting the tax credit they're
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
getting the tax credits as part of the
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
the development and what we're trying to
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
do is this holistic housing how do we
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
take all of these different pieces so as
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
D indicated housing Choice vouchers have
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
to be accepted in our properties we do
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
some project-based vouchers I'll give
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
you a good example Housing Trust Fund
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
which is profits from Fanny May and
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
Freddy Mack you have to serve Folks at
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
30% area median income they won't even
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
be able to You Know cover the rent and
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
so in that case um you need to put
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
vouchers into those deals so that the
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
apartment will generate enough rent in
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
order to carry the apartment cost and
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
then one other program that New
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be very proud of is a
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
HUD program called section
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
811 um project-based rental assistance
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is a partnership between New
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and the State
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
where folks with severe mental illness
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
are able to get a unit within one of our
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
projects so it's the same thing you if
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
you'll put an 811 unit in your project
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
you'll get a certain number of points so
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's our encouragement and integration
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
approach I think we've we have and I'll
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
get the number wrong I think it's
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
247 currently are out there in the
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
universe we just applied to HUD
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they changed how many we
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
could apply for but we did get 50 more
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
and they're small numbers but for
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
individuals with severe mental illness
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
and for their families it's something I
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
think we're we're very we're very proud
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
of um so I think that's about it you
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
know we have a we have limited resources
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
we distribute them through competitive
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
processes we try our best to include the
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
disabled as part of that policy but it's
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
always being balanced against the fact
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is in a severe
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and I will tell you that
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
a today a two-bedroom 900 square foot
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
apartment probably has a total
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
$370,000 and um so that's why takes a
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
lot of capital subsidy to get an
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
apartment that you then have to rent to
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
so okay senator
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
first um thank you for uh giving us this
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
presentation I have a a few things I'm
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand so you know we're
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
tasked to find solutions to this problem
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
which it it it's very evident by all the
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
meetings we've had and listening to
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
families and listening to all of you
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
that it's a serious problem but I keep
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
hearing that a lot of it's tied
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
federally and when when I'm given a
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
problem I'm kind of Tenacious and I want
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
to find a solution and I'm trying to
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand as a state we're hearing the
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
problems but I'm not being able to grasp
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
like a real concrete solution um and I
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
know the housing is like tied to all
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
this inflation and the economy and all
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
that um and that so I I want to see if
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
we can hone in on a real solution that I
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
can like advocate for or fight for also
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
um rather than reinvent Wheels is there
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
any other state that has mastered this
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
problem I would sure like to know and
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
how they did it so those are my
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
questions um well I I can we actually
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
belong to a national trade Association
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
the National Conference of State Housing
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
Finance agencies I can ask the question
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
about what other states are doing in
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
terms of this issue housing for the
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
disabled I will tell you I I know some
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the answer we just got back is that
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire relative to
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
other States even within New England
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
does not put a significant amount of
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
money into housing um and so I think
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
part of the solution is going to be
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
additional State resources but if you
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
would give me the opportunity Senator to
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
have a internal discussion about what
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
some solutions might be because I'm just
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
ignacius who runs multifamily I work for
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
Jack and Rob DPP our executive director
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and I have as I sit here I represent
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the people of New Hampshire
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
which is also very diverse in terms of
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit nonprofit developers but I
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
will ask the question about what other
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
states are doing to see if we can get
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
some information apprciate that because
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
I it's important we hear the problems
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm not getting a i i we have to
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
find the solution and some of it can be
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
legisla but not all of it can be so I we
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
well thank you yeah thank you
 
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
well thank you yeah thank you
Representative

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
lontine no I forgot okay sorry so just
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
to clarify the building cost of 350 to
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
$370,000 is per unit in a multif family
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay and that's very consistent
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
whether it's a for-profit or a nonprofit
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
because one of the requirements when you
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
get our resources you have to put things
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
out to bid
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that we know that it's competitive
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
those will vary based on location for
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
example a green field in gtown for
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
example May cost less than an infill
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
urban in downtown Manchester and
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the northern part of the
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
state it can cost more because there
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
y

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
y
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
do you have um an idea of um how many
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
units are in
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
process um around the state to you know
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
I think one thing that people with
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities have is that they have very
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
low incomes so it's hard for them to
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
compete on the market do do you have any
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
concept of you know where things are
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
being built CU you know people with
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities want to stay in their
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
community ities and and how many um
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
units are um are are recently built or
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
in process or um and a need has been
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
identified in a particular Community is
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's a lot to ask no I I I think the
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
answer is yes um I'll have to figure out
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
whether we post that information on our
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
website okay they are required as part
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
of tenant selection to give folks an
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply it's supposed to be
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
an open process it cannot be a closed
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
process I know internally we have a list
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
which I didn't bring with me of all the
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
units that are under production with us
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
and where they're located um but but in
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
terms of is that something that we make
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
publicly available I have to take I'd
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
have to take that back and take a look
 
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.710 align:start position:0%
have to take that back and take a look
at

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah I so the reason that I ask is
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm trying to identify you know
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
um how many do we need how many do we
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
have um Coming forward and what is the
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
gap and how do we address that Gap
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
um do you have any other questions
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
yella with
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire housing they have uh
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
they have a bunch of different programs
 
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.309 align:start position:0%
they have a bunch of different programs
right

00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
believe some of the programs that you're
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
talking about when you're talking about
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
um like that that they're required to
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
accept vouchers um
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
is not just projects that you guys
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
are are kind of spearheading but if
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.789 align:start position:0%
are are kind of spearheading but if
you're

00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
financing um if someone comes to you and
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
says like hey I want to fin Finance this
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
this project is that is that the type of
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
project that you're talking about when
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like they have they
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
have to accept the vouchers if they come
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
to you and say hey we want to finance
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
this project part of the stipulation of
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
the loan is that they accept the
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
vouchers yeah I mean most of the folks
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
who come to us to develop or purchase
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
and Rehab yeah um are coming to us
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
because of our our preferential
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
financing whether it's access to tax
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
exempt bonds or it's capital subsidy and
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
all of them are required to accept
 
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.109 align:start position:0%
all of them are required to accept
vouchers

00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um when you're prop when you're uh
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
giving out the
 
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.150 align:start position:0%
giving out the
loans

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
do you look at or how much it is costing
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
per unit um as kind of giving them a
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
better giving them preferential
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
treatment because obviously if you can
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
get more
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
units then your dollar let's say you
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
have $1 million right if you can if
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
you're have projects that are
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
150,000 per unit versus
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
$350,000 per unit you're going to get a
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
lot more units and so I guess my
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
question is are we trying to get the
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of units out of the
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
dollars The Limited dollars that you
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
guys do have or is it kind of just first
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
come first serve or H how are you
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
deciding which
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
projects come first so um everything I
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
I'll give the an answer to your last
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
question all of our funds that are
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy dollars go through a competitive
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
process and there's scoring connected to
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
the competitive process we we try to
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
look at the cost and we have some
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for example we have a
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
maximum total development cost that is
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
based on the market and based on the
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
information so every time we do a
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
development the cost gets entered into a
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
database on a per square foot type of
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
project and um and per and per unit so
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
that's what Market is telling us that is
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
what the market and it's not 150 I mean
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
if we see something at you know two 300
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
you're like wow this is something this
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
is good and so yes we look at getting
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
scarce dollars and getting the most
 
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
units there's no question but there are
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
other considerations I don't know down
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
in 249 Main Street in nashaa there was
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know an empty space and a lot that
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
the city really wanted to develop
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
and so there you're trying to help a
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
community and you're trying to get
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
people the ability to live downtown but
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
it was Urban infill which meant that the
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
costs were higher and and the like so
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes we care about TDC we
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
wish we could control it more but it's
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
very difficult to control because the
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
costs are based on the bid process um
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
and TDC is one thing we look at we look
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
at other factors such as are you willing
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
to do more ADA Compliant units that's
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
too I I just
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
want to um the sense that I'm getting so
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
I I understand that that maybe the the
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
companies that I'm thinking about um
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
that I've
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
seen online
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
um been creating like panelized housing
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
and getting affordable housing very up
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
very quickly you know within like a week
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're like built um they're dried in
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
and and stuff like that they were doing
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
specific um affordable housing projects
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
that were in the orders of like $150
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um for a standalone unit not a
 
00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.630 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um for a standalone unit not a
multif

00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
multif
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
family um but I'm just wondering if if
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh if we're not seeing those types of
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
projects being
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
proposed um maybe there's maybe it's
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
something that I you know should reach
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
out to that the companies that are doing
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of a thing and say hey we
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you should apply in in New
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and my my concern though
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
is if they did that maybe they wouldn't
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
have you know enough points if they're
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
if they're just being like Oh I'm
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
building you know a house um if and it's
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
just you know very affordable that's not
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily checking all of your point
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
boxes that they would then get high on
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
the list of
 
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.309 align:start position:0%
the list of
funding

01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
um on the list for funding right if
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
there if someone was specifically
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
targeting like oh I'm trying to get a
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of points so that I can get high
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
on your your guys's list um how many how
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
many people um
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
that are kind of like waiting I guess to
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
be on your uh to be
 
01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:14.589 align:start position:0%
be on your uh to be
funded

01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that have a project that maybe
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
is you know not not very high points but
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
H how long is their kind of waight or do
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
they just do they
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
how long is that waiting list I guess so
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
we don't do a waiting list we do
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
everything on a yearly basis although
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
this year we have awarded points under
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
the 4% tax exempt on program if you had
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
a prior application that we ran out of
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
money so that folks don't wait I will
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
say like on our 9% which is the big
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
production program we had 19 developers
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
submit preliminary applications and that
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
got Whitted down because they need the
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
numbers to work and the numbers didn't
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
work for them and that got whittel down
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
to um I believe it was 12 and we will
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
only be able to award four or five
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
projects a year on the 9% tax credit
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
side and we have done we have seen
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
panelized and I will say for the multif
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
family panelized there may be there's
 
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
certainly Time Savings but I'm not sure
 
01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
the cost savings are that significant so
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I I've seen that I've heard that
 
01:02:26.599 --> 01:02:28.190 align:start position:0%
yeah I I've seen that I've heard that
too

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
um in C you know certain companies do
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
different ways um the so what when
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying you got you got whittel
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
down to
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
12 um that that means that there's 12
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
developers out there that have some
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
property that they would like to to you
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
know develop housing in but we can only
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
develop housing in four of those those
 
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.029 align:start position:0%
develop housing in four of those those
places

01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
and so there's you know eight places
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we didn't develop or are you
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess that's yes and they
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
might go from the 9% where they get 70%
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
tax credit we can work to see can we
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
switch them over to the 4% where it
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
takes less Capital subsidy and they get
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
less credits but they can carry more
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
debt with higher rents we we try to work
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
with folks cuz we want to build more
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
affordable rental homes that's our
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's our number one goal but with the
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
high cost and limited
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
resources the all states basically
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
follow the same not identically the same
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
but the same competitive
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you thank you I I
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
have you have go I have one quick
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
question do you know what the
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
differential is in cost between a
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
regular two-bedroom unit and one with
 
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.829 align:start position:0%
regular two-bedroom unit and one with
Universal

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
Design no but I that's a fair thing for
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
us to see we can contact for example
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
Corporation for Supportive Housing and
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
we can see whether they have that data I
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair question and the
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
issue of Universal Design comes up
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
during our qualified allocation plan
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
meetings and I think the challenge is is
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
as a quasi public entity trying to
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
balance the extra cost with the unit
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
production uh because we're we're trying
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
to build units and um that's obviously
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about our disabled
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters but if Universal
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
Design I don't know how much it adds
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
I'll find out so do you know if any of
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
the state programs um subsidize
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
Universal Design in their
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
programs I do not but I think it's it's
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
a fair question okay the other my my
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
other question is um who would you
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
recommend that we talk to um that
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
administers these um State um housing
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
trusts who who's in charge so in terms
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
of the hous level yeah on well on the
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
state level it's us we okay so basically
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is entitled
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the Housing Trust Fund dollars and
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
they have appointed New Hampshire
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
housing as the administrative entity for
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
dispersing those okay so we are speaking
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the if we wanted say some of this
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
money from the Housing Trust to go to
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
Universal Design
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
would we be able to do that or would it
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
have to come from one of the other state
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
programs like there's the affordable
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
housing trust I
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
know there was a whole list of them here
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
but but in terms you said because
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
because HUD you said is limited but um
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
you said we we need to rely on
 
01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
state-based programs for some of this
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I if I if I understand your
 
01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.870 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I if I if I understand your
question

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting question and
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
again I'm just ignacious and the multif
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
family housing team about whether the
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislature could say you shall use a
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
percentage of your housing trust fund
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
dollars to to to do it Universal Design
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
um It's Complicated I mean you're adding
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
a layer of complexity but it's a fair
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
question and I can speak internally and
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we'll get back to you on that it
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
will mean less units and but if that's
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
the policy decision of the
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
legislature that's the decision and I
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
don't know how the
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
HUD so HUD HUD has so many like for us
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
to get it become the administer it's
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
pretty simple state says you administer
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
it whether the state can then impose
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
requirements on how it administer and
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
whether those line up with the federal
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
regs I'm going to have to do some
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
research on that okay
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
just repres the senator that was my
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
question I I felt like we'd have to
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
legally look into this because um that's
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
can be very complicated we'd have to
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't put forward
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that we haven't you know
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
dotted all the eyes and crossed the teas
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I I just wonder uh I this may be a
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of an ignorant question but
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking out loud is there a way
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
would it be legal or appropriate to
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
instead of taking taking these funds
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
that that are you've already mentioned
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
the different housing components
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
completely start a brand new way of
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
doing it specifically for this issue uh
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
like we started you know the invest New
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then we did legislation on
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
housing Champions and would we be able
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
to start a whole just new funding
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism for this issue so my so again
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
not just speaking as Ignatius I mean
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
there already is the statute and I and
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
it's like 24
 
01:07:57.799 --> 01:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
it's like 24
c57

01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
c57
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
24c 204 204 c c
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
57 which is the affordable housing fund
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
and if you're looking for a
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism that may be a mechanism where
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
you're not creating a brand new because
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
every time the government creates a new
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
approach it adds a level of complexity
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
to it and and I'm not speaking in favor
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
or against
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
this idea I'm just providing information
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
about that may be the mechanism if you
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
were looking to do it thank you I'm just
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out like how we're
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to proceed you know you know for a
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
solution okay we got two questions here
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
um representative L montine and then
 
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.070 align:start position:0%
um representative L montine and then
representative

01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
Ella I just want to go back you brought
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
up the project in nashaa so I'm trying
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
to get a sense of is it often a site
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
that comes to you and says says we want
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
to develop this site for affordable
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
housing will you then put out the bills
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the start the whole bidding process and
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
let developers know we want someone to
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
build this it's a good question so as a
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
general rule we're New Hampshire Housing
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority the
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
developers do that work so in that
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
particular case the city of nashaa says
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
to a developer neighbor work Southern
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hey we have this lot could
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
you look into developing it so that's
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
that's the answer I will say that there
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
have been a few instances where New
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing has owned land from
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
the state um where the on 90 95 where
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
the liquor store was going to be and I
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
believe it was Hampton we had a piece of
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
land that we did just that we put it out
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
to bid and Developers put forward
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
proposals that we then made a decision
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to sell the property to
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
this developer for this use but that's
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
not generally the way it works generally
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
the developers are in the communities
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
and finding where to build and and
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
working with the communities on that and
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
then they come to you for help with the
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
finance yes okay I'm representative
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
from the housing that you currently
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
Finance do you know how many uh or what
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of the um the
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
units are uh meet the universal
 
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.630 align:start position:0%
units are uh meet the universal
design

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
standards if any well I can find out the
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
answer to that question um my guess
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
would be it's probably
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
not a significant number to go to your
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
earlier questions when you're trying to
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
control total development cost if you go
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
to Universal
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
Design um you're we're going to add to
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
those cost and that may be a decision
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's a good policy decision but that's
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that we're weighing in
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to build the number of
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
units for the best cost um univer and I
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
like that question what would it cost to
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
to do Universal Design and we'll we'll
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
try to see if we can find an answer to
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so um I have another
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
question um which is something that
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing a lot about um Visa
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
part U Vis housing
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
um do parking
 
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.390 align:start position:0%
um do parking
restrictions

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
um make a projects fail because they
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't pencil I mean when we're talking
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
about people with disabilities you know
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
if you're blind or you know you may have
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
a disability that prevents you from
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
driving um do you does every unit need
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
to parking
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
spaces that's my that's my question do
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
you find that that is a barrier to um
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
making projects
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
pencil the simple is answer is
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
everything that is a requirement impacts
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether the property is going to pencil
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
out I mean that's the bottom line if
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing two parking units you're
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
consuming land and then you're building
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
it and then you're maintaining it so
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the requirement
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
of parking spaces um drives up the
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
initial cost and the long-term
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost of the projects and I
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
believe um I believe New Hampshire
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
Housing and Jack may know is more
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
supportive of having a lower threshold
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
of of of spaces per unit uh because you
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of one-bedroom we have
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
senior housing and and if you have a
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
senior housing do you really need two
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
spaces all you're doing is driving up
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
cost that aren't really adding units so
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know Jack if you have any
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
comments has that been um has that been
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
a problem given local zoning
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
requirements well that issue was
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
addressed by the Senate um in the past
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
year um I think um through a bill that
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
might have been filed by Senator Perkins
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
quoka and there was um uh a fair amount
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
of negotiation with the towns because
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the towns yes were very very concerned
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
about hey you know we want to be able to
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
set our own parking requirements and you
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
counterargument um from uh housing
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates was what inis just said which
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
is if they're unnecessarily burdensome
 
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:42.709 align:start position:0%
is if they're unnecessarily burdensome
it

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
creates excess costs uh and and can
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually make a project financially
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
infeasible so I believe um that a bill
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
was signed into law that sets a limit of
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
one and a half parking spaces per unit
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
as a maximum um at the local level okay
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would say is a parking
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
space doesn't exist in space it exists
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the ground and a lot of the sites in
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um require a lot of
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
engineering and a lot of working to get
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
density and every time you add a a
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
parking space you are impacting the
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
ability to have density on the housing
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
representa I believe the the bill you're
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
referring to is
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
hb400 which is uh a bill sponsored by uh
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
Miriam Williamson no uh Rebecca
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
Williamson Rebecca Williamson and and
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
myself oh yes um and we negotiated to I
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
think it's one and a half for
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's structures greater than
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
10 units I believe it's 10 units or
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
greater or something like that that the
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
Senate amended our the house version was
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
um no they're not allowed to require two
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
units or I think it was a maximum
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
requirement of one unit and it got
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
negotiated up to one and a half yeah
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're absolutely right on the
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
sponsorship I think I was confused
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
because at one point the home nebs Bill
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
may have gotten merged with 00 M and
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
then separated so I didn't know how it
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
it sort of all ended up but yes um
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
obviously um representative Mick
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
Williams and you yourself representative
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
one400 just look that
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
one I'm surprised you didn't ask that
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
question anyway okay so we have um all
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
right does anyone have any further
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions I see some folks from the
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
audience have have have wanted to speak
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
but um and you know if you could uh s
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
around and and do you have any do you
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
on what what we can do to encourage more
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities what would be your just are
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
you asking of the audience or well I'm
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
asking of you guys at first well I I
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
guess what I would do is I would request
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have have that
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
discussion internally because of the
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
integration of so many of these programs
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and if we if we do for example
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
Universal Design what does that mean and
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
I don't I can't run those numbers right
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
now but if you would give us that
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity we will provide our thoughts
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
is that fair Jack yeah so one of the
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of this um of this committee at
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Richard's request um we are
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
authorized to go for another year we'll
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
be um providing a preliminary report in
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
early November but then we have a full
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
year so we can um meet with people and
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
do deeper dives into these um into these
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
issues so thank you for offering that I
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so do you have anything
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to tell us okay so so
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
please stay around and we might call you
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
back up um because I see that there are
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
some people in the audience who have
 
01:17:22.199 --> 01:17:23.149 align:start position:0%
some people in the audience who have
some

01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts all right thank you for the
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify no thank you for
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
coming and um hope um hopefully on the
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
22nd we'll be hearing from some of some
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
developers New Hampshire housing um
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
action is working on finding some
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit developers to come and talk to
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
us about these
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
coming thank you for the opportunity
 
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
coming thank you for the opportunity
great

01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay so if if people from the audience
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
would like to uh ask a question or say
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
say something please come forward to the
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
name I just at Leisa Bodwin um I just
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
have one follow-up question from from
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Ricky 's question
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
um regarding the voucher program and I'm
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
wondering um if HUD has a
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
regulation that prevents New Hampshire
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
from contributing to the voucher
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
program um and or another way to put the
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
question is there a regulation or
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for New Hampshire to
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
contribute funding to the voucher
 
01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:55.390 align:start position:0%
contribute funding to the voucher
program

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
yes you don't think that's appropriate I
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't I think that in my in my opinion I
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that um we would do that
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
exactly in that mechanism I think that
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
what we would do if we were to do
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
something would be to essentially
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
earmark some
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
money um
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
and essenti
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
the requirements to get said Grant or
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
whatever would be that they be uh a
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
voucher holder or something like that
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore then that money would
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
essentially only go to those people that
 
01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
essentially only go to those people that
had

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
voucher and so then you would be kind of
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
like helping essentially that um it was
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
also kind of something that I was
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about as far as like if we knew
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
the difference between um the cost to
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
build a house you know is it 10% more to
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
go to um Universal Design or something
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there was some mechanism that knew
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
that that the um New Hampshire
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislature would be willing to earmark
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
some money that would say hey if you had
 
01:20:09.719 --> 01:20:10.870 align:start position:0%
some money that would say hey if you had
a

01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
project um you know we're willing
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
to um if you have a project of you know
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
five units or 10 units we're willing to
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
put up that you know half of that 10% or
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
whatever if you're going to make it
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
Universal design or something and justk
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
some money specifically to help
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
incentiv the Universal Design which then
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
would those units might be able to be
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
better suited to address
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
the disabled populations
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
right so I so I guess my question D
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
is what could the state give you money
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
for vouchers that's the question yes and
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
okay Senator I just keep thinking about
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
how all these people are on these
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
ridiculous weight lists and I keep going
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
back to what you said about somebody
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
terminally ill it's absolutely
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and I call this an
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
emergency this is an
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
emergency I think one of the things I
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
didn't mention is can you come to the
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
microphone please because we're we're on
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I maybe should have
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned when I talk about attrition
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
the average weight time of a voucher
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
participant on the program is 11 to 12
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
years wow okay so if you don't have
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
turnover nutrition you have a set number
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
of subsidies by the federal government
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
you can't go over 4,000 you know or
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the number may be and if
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's very little turnover because
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
once someone has a voucher they hold on
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
to that and if um you someone has
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
extremely low
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
income they're probably going to have
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
extremely low income for 10 12 years you
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
know unless they're working towards um
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
getting off the program or participating
 
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
in some of our family selfs efficiency
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
programs or or they're working you know
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they want to um graduate themselves
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
off the program otherwise the length of
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
grown followup so while they're in this
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
waiting period this endless waiting
 
01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
period where are they what are they
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
doing another good
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
question we ask when they come to the
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
top of the waiting list uh we have to
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
report to HUD if they um are homeless
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
when they get to the top and unless
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's the only question we really ask
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
them but most of them share or will tell
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
us they were either you know staying
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
with friends and family doubling up um
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
living in substandard housing not paying
 
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
other bills to pay their
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
by

01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so unfortunately now what we have
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
to say to a lot of colle
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
is the voucher is not an immediate
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
available resource for many it's it's
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's Federal program and that's how it
 
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
it's Federal program and that's how it
is

01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
funded what do you think about the idea
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
state um providing funding for owners of
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
substandard housing say will help will
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
provide money to rehab this if you agree
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
to accept Section 8 vouchers or if you
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
agree to convert it to Universal Design
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
is there there have been some home for
 
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
all see Coast United Way had a a
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
program something like that where they
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
had a certain amount of funds that they
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
would for landlords who would um be part
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know everything about their
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
program but if a landlord wanted to be
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
part of their program they would give
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
them some money maybe for an in
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
incentive fee for some repairs maybe
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
damages mitigation fund and in return
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
they would rent to a a voucher
 
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.550 align:start position:0%
they would rent to a a voucher
holder

01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
holder
 
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.070 align:start position:0%
holder
um

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
possible um I I guess one one final
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
question that that that I have well I
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
keep saying that but um there are other
 
01:24:56.189 --> 01:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
programs like 79e which is for you know
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh downtown buildings that are um
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
underutilized Etc
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
who who Who's in charge of
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
that do do we know no no is it the local
 
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities but there's the
 
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:21.070 align:start position:0%
municipalities but there's the
okay

01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay can you come to the microphone
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so 79 E vouchers which allow
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities to provide tax credits
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
for yes so RSA
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
79e um essentially is tax deferral um
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
for new projects uh and recently uh
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
among the uses um could be for uh
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
conversion of I think um uh business
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
properties into housing residential
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
housing um but there's no sort of
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide program with an administrator
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is simply a tax incentive that towns
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
May opt to uh apply to a given project
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
in in their own
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
town um would are are there any
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
um are there any prohibitions
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
against what would need to happen for
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
towns to
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
include um Universal Design as um a
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
um as an attribute of a project that
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
would allow the town to provide this tax
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
incentive do would we have to change the
 
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.430 align:start position:0%
incentive do would we have to change the
law

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think so but I am not an
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
expert in this area and I can definitely
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
go back to the office and ask um someone
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
who's got more expertise in this area
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
all right I appreciate that you have
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
have some thoughts you've worked a lot
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
on this Housing St yeah 79e I think if
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
some I think that you would need to
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
change the 79e to specifically State
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
like hey you're allowed to um because
 
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
it's essentially kind of like a list of
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
things that the municipality is allowed
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
to provide um tax incentives for and so
 
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to add another one then
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
you would need to add it to
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
79e um or
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
or kind of say for example the one that
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
just got recently added to change
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
commercial um you know office space
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
into uh housing if you could say as long
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
as it you know comma as long or as long
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
as it meets Universal Design and that
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
would then limit the municipality to
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
only providing that benefit to those
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that were Universal Design or you could
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
go the other way and say say a specific
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
or you know they can do um given a
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
increased um incentive to those that
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
meet Universal Design or something like
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
that but I think all of those language
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
changes would be within 79 E thank you
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah okay all right is there
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
anything else are there oh yes come
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
forward hi Will Walker Hollis uh thank
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you New Hampshire
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
housing for all the information today
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding presentation you guys have
 
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
helped me a lot in my own exploration in
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
the space I do have one request because
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
you guys were taking on so much already
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
um as you were looking at the
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
incremental cost to do Universal Design
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
from building um I'm also wondering can
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
you do a research into what it cost to
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
rehab a place to make it
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
accessible um we in in working in
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
software accessibility for decades we
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
often found that retrofitting something
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
was far more expensive than doing it
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
right the first
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%

five or maybe it's Roman 5 a uh uh or or
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
no Roman 6 where I said um I was asking
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
if if the statistics they that they were
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
giving were for people with intellectual
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities or just people that were
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
just generally disabled the answer was
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
that they were only specifically giving
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
us uh information about people with in
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities it had nothing
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
to do with people with physical
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities so I don't know that answer
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
was using ID as example really yeah I
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
think I meant to get back to that but I
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay it didn't have good notes on it so
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
but thank you you'll have a recording
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
