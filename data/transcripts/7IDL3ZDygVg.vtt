everybody has a copy in front of us here
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think there's copies available for the
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair this is ours okay thank you
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
based on the conversation that we had
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
the other day
i

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
um took it upon myself to draft the
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
following amendment 2025.
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
it dealt with the housing piece
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
the senate for
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 400 piece
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
um so section 83
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
i deleted the
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
last sentence and put a period after the
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
word development
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think that representative turcotte may
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
want to discuss that further
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
on 92
 
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
on 92
and

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
93 added
 
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.390 align:start position:0%
93 added
section

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
5 and
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
on the next page j 93
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
and that's to allow
 
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
and that's to allow
um

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
um
separately

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
separately adopted ordinance
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
the thought was to try to give greater
 
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.310 align:start position:0%
the thought was to try to give greater
um

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
participation by the voters or voter
 
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
participation by the voters or voter
approval

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
so that does provide greater voting
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
approval by the legislative body and it
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
allows for the the posting of that
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and all in accordance with
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
statute and i worked with a municipal
 
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
statute and i worked with a municipal
association

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
um on this language and i think natchez
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
here he just
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah there he is so um they thought it
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
worked for
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
cities and
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
towns okay so let's have uh
 
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
towns okay so let's have uh
representative

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
your name was referenced here by the
 
00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:14.949 align:start position:0%
your name was referenced here by the
senator

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that particular
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
section um yeah
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
although i think
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the attempt was made to actually uh
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
get language in that brought on the
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
point i brought up the other day on i'm
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
talking 92 and 93 right now go back to
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that the language in
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to accomplish and
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
my concern was that
 
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.670 align:start position:0%
my concern was that
any

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
municipality that has adopted the
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
municipal economic development and
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
revitalization district and does anybody
 
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
revitalization district and does anybody
know

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
are there those
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
already existing in the state has there
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
been there are so i'm okay
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
so my my issue was that by adding the
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
language in uh
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
in five
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
it was a it was effectively bypassing
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
the town's ability
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh to have a say in whether they wanted
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
that particular
issue

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
the uh develop the revitalization
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
district and that's because
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
before a municipal economic development
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
district is can be brought into a town
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
or municipality or city it has to be
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
voted on by the legislative body or
 
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
voted on by the legislative body or
the

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.069 align:start position:0%
the
people

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
citizens at a meeting so the intent of
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay we're okay with that language
 
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
okay we're okay with that language
of

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
but we want the voters and or the
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
representatives of that town
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
to specifically
 
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
to specifically
utilize

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 162k1 which is called the local
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
option which is an affirmative vote to
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
bring that piece
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
into their existing
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipal uh
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
revitalization district and again i i do
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
not believe the language that's provided
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
does that i just passed out what i
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
originally given uh to senator bradley a
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
couple days ago man maybe a day ago
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that captures the
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
essence of exactly what we're trying to
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish um it may not be perfectly
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
worded um and it's not in an amendment
 
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.630 align:start position:0%
worded um and it's not in an amendment
form

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.829 align:start position:0%
form
but

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
the what's trying to be accomplished i
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
think is much better captured in that
 
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.470 align:start position:0%
think is much better captured in that
language

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.670 align:start position:0%
language
um

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
back to paragraph 83
 
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
back to paragraph 83
um

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
the only other thing we'd like to see in
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
that and again it's it's it's because of
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
things forced on municipalities and that
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment i just handed out here
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
where it says if a municipality allows
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
an increased density i just changed the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
word there to permits and increased
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
density but the important part is right
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
after it mentions rsa
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
354 a15 8
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
i've strike a struck in the words shall
 
00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
i've strike a struck in the words shall
allow

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
and inserted may permit and that again
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
is to give the municipality
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the decision rather than the state
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
handing down a mandate
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
so those those are the only two things
 
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
so those those are the only two things
uh

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
like i say i i like the
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
the wording of ours better i think it
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually captures um
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
i've read through the amendment that
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
senator bradley passed out several times
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i just don't believe it captures
 
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.389 align:start position:0%
and i just don't believe it captures
what

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
the issue i was trying to raise thank
 
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
the issue i was trying to raise thank
you

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh any uh discussion on this now we so
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
we have two uh
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
potential perspectives here
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
both referencing
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to hear from
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
natch of the municipal
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
association sure as to what's workable
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you senator does he have a copy of
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
does he have the bradley amendment as
 
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.389 align:start position:0%
does he have the bradley amendment as
well

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i've seen i've seen both amendments uh
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record nature grace
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
association um
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
so i guess i will uh address sections 92
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
and 93
 
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
and 93
first

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that the amendment that
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
senator bradley handed out effectively
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
does the same thing as um representative
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
turcotte's uh the language is slightly
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
different but
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh it does say that if separately
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
adopted by the city or town
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
by the procedures described in rsa 162
 
00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
by the procedures described in rsa 162
k1

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
k1
 
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
k1
so

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
that separates out this new section 5
 
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.230 align:start position:0%
that separates out this new section 5
from

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
and section j
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
from the existing definition of public
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
use under 92 and then
 
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
use under 92 and then
um

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the district establishment under 93
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so you'd have to have a separate
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
town meeting vote if you have a town
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
meeting or
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
in a city council or a city um a
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
city council vote in order to adopt
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
um those provisions so effectively it
 
00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:04.629 align:start position:0%
um those provisions so effectively it
does

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the same thing um
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
i just think the language might be a
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
little bit clearer in senator bradley's
 
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.269 align:start position:0%
little bit clearer in senator bradley's
amendment

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
as far as section 83 goes
 
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
as far as section 83 goes
um

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see any legal difference between
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
the term allows and permits
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
effectively the same thing
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
although it is um the case that if you
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
were to change shall allow
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
to may permit
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
um that would make that would shift um
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
workforce housing from being something
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily linked to um
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
housing for older persons in terms of
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
any sort of
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
any sort of incentives
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
to something that is just permissive and
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
would not would not put a requirement on
 
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
would not would not put a requirement on
municipalities

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that's helpful but i went through
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
that rather quickly so i'm happy to
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:22.629 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
so is the committee
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
good with either one of these i'd like
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
to try to start getting some of this
 
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
to try to start getting some of this
accomplished

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
at least in terms of section 92 and 93
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
my language
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
which i think he said is a bit clearer
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
it has the same intent as representative
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
turcottes so i would hope that we're
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
okay with that in terms of
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
point of 83
 
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.510 align:start position:0%
point of 83
is

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
if a community is going to have um
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
elderly housing
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
then with incentives then it would have
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
workforce housing with incentives i mean
 
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.549 align:start position:0%
workforce housing with incentives i mean
one

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
potential option would be
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
83 the way it is in this amendment but
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
with a sunset clause
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
of say five years see how it works um
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know and the legislature would have
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
to reauthorize it so that would be
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that i could live
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
with i haven't had a chance to share
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
with my senate colleagues but hopefully
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
they could live with it too and i think
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
that would i think that would be
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know another
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
um guardrail so to speak
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro you had your
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
speaker on as well just a quick if if
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
indeed uh senator bradley's
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
concept can you can you lower that
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
please right if if senator bradley's
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
concept is accepted then we would take
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
the language that he's presented in his
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
in his amendment 2025 s and the shall
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
allow should be uh in it
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
rather than the may permit correct
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.990 align:start position:0%
i i think
yeah

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
that

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
in both 92 and 93 are acceptable to
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte because
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
basically according to the testimony
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
we've just heard they're exactly the
 
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.669 align:start position:0%
we've just heard they're exactly the
same

00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:36.549 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
the what what we're talking about is two
 
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.070 align:start position:0%
the what what we're talking about is two
words

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
with the possibility of a sunset
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
provision with the possibility of a
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
sunset provision representative yeah
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and again i
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
on 92 and 93 it if the intent is
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually the exact same thing as as i'm
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting in my language and again my
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
language is
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
it is slightly different but to me it's
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
more it's more clear
 
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
more it's more clear
as

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
i'm always
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about the intent
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure
 
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure
um

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
gets that attempt intent
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
across as well i'm willing to look at it
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
some more
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
as to 83
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether the word allow stays in or
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
changes to permit that's not my issue my
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue is the shall um
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
i i believe uh just as easily we could
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
put may in there and we could have a
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
sunset position um
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
on a may um
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
dislike telling towns you must do this
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what shall
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
the word shall means you know there's a
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
wide range of words we can use shall
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
could would may
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and shall's the most definitive of
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
them all and um
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
for me i i would need to see a may in
 
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.190 align:start position:0%
for me i i would need to see a may in
there

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
carnelli thank you um
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
it might be down to one word but it's a
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
minor important word there and uh i i
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with what uh representative
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
turcotte said and also um we've received
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of comments um
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
both from the public and from our caucus
 
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:32.830 align:start position:0%
both from the public and from our caucus
about

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.470 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
section related to 400
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.470 align:start position:0%
and i think
the

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
may versus shall
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
would also be
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
a major point in taking this back to our
 
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
a major point in taking this back to our
caucus

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it looks
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
as if there's just uh primarily we're in
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
in concurrence on 92 and 93 the intent
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and hearing the department say that
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they're reading it the same way
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
so the issues primarily now with 83
 
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
so the issues primarily now with 83
and

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
that word may
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
and possibly scooting around that with a
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
sunset provision
 
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.710 align:start position:0%
sunset provision
clause

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
so we need to you know put this aside
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
now and we know that there's there's a
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
possible way of steering the ship
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
are there before we drop 400 uh
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative do you have anything else
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
no nothing other than that other than
 
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
no nothing other than that other than
the

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.909 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
do they end up passing out the full
 
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.669 align:start position:0%
do they end up passing out the full
amendment

00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
with all the
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
deletions i think senator bradley we did
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the other day am i correct we
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
passed out and then we were only down to
 
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
passed out and then we were only down to
these

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
these three issues really these
 
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
these three issues really these
paragraph

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
we had agreed to take out sections 86 89
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
90 and 94.
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
you would agree to
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
keep in all of the other
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
sections other than
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
83 92 and 93. yeah did i confuse
 
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
83 92 and 93. yeah did i confuse
everybody

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
i do believe we are okay with the
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions of these three paragraphs i
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
would of course we have time we will
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
confirm that but i don't believe there
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
are any other issues on 400
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay and i had that that communication
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
also so i think we're we've got that
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
noted too now so we're closing in on 400
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
um is there need for any more discussion
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
on 400 at this time
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the conferees 420 is totally out of
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
the picture now that was resolved
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so we will not be uh
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
discussing 420 that is out of this bill
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's been handled through the conference
 
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
it's been handled through the conference
there

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i would just say
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a chance to consult with
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
senator d'allesandro but i think senator
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
hennessey's fine yes i'm fine are you
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
fine with that senator d okay thank you
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so we've communicated on that
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
that extraordinary needs grant is going
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
forward with accountability within it
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
next i guess we need to address uh
 
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
next i guess we need to address uh
430.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
430.
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
and where we are on this uh
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
all the way from roman numeral 3 to
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 25 on the bill itself
 
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 25 on the bill itself
um

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i had a discussion with some folks in
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the health and human services earlier
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
and there are some portions of 430 which
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
are technical corrections that were in
 
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
are technical corrections that were in
the

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
original house version of 430
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
which will enable the department be in
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
conjunction with what is happening in
 
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
conjunction with what is happening in
reality

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.230 align:start position:0%
reality
um

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
so i i i think somewhere along the way
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
we need to have this discussion and i've
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
asked that those
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
areas be
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
marked as far as
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
which ones
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
are not in the floor amendment which
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
were in our house bill as came out of
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:38.070 align:start position:0%
the house
committee

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay so backing up a little bit where i
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
was when i was reviewing again
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation last night at midnight
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh i saw sections dealing with the
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
glencliff home
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and and and uh being able to
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
provide uh incentives for folks to come
 
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.630 align:start position:0%
provide uh incentives for folks to come
in

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
finding these nurses now is very
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
difficult they're in competition with my
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
area with with hitchcock big time and
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
even with grafton county home and with
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
the cottage hospital
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so they're they're looking at
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
anything being able to award up to ten
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to attract these nurses
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
to the facility
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
um there are there's also some cleanup
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
in regard to um
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
some of the uh funds which were paid
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then this is just one small area
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
um i had another question about the
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
kinship uh care homes which is in this
 
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.510 align:start position:0%
kinship uh care homes which is in this
thing

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
and where there can be an exception and
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
extending from 30 days to 100 days 180
 
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.549 align:start position:0%
extending from 30 days to 100 days 180
days

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
placing children into these facilities
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
which are not licensed and i was just
 
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.310 align:start position:0%
which are not licensed and i was just
asking

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
is there oversight of these facilities
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
during the extended one-half year period
 
00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.630 align:start position:0%
during the extended one-half year period
time

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
if these things are not critical to you
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
know and we're in the original version i
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
can't see any reason why we wouldn't be
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
moving those parts forward
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.029 align:start position:0%
any discussion
yeah

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
as discussed the other day
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
will not be part of a complete package
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
of 1661.
 
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
of 1661.
um

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that can be brought up
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that can be brought up
uh

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
in six months they can uh put it forward
 
00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.029 align:start position:0%
in six months they can uh put it forward
then

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that the senate had the
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to call a separate
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on they declined
 
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on they declined
that

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
they non-concurred
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
and then took
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
our 430 less the floor amendment and put
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
it on here this bill
 
00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
it on here this bill
will

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
will not be part
 
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
will not be part
of

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
the 1662.
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just came from 1662. 1661
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we're in one today
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
is there a response
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like where we're coming
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
from now is that 430 should not be part
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
of this bill
so

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
we may need to
 
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.070 align:start position:0%
we may need to
reconvene

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
reconvene
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
on this issue um
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
i somewhere in my pile of papers here
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
docket i can look it up easily and
 
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.389 align:start position:0%
docket i can look it up easily and
quickly

00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
but i suspect that
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative umberger can illuminate
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
on this i believe that the house pass
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
version of 430
 
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
version of 430
passed

00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
out of the finance committee the house
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
went to the floor there was the
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment added that i believe was house
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
the senate rejected that
 
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.510 align:start position:0%
the senate rejected that
added

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
the balance of 430 back to
 
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.470 align:start position:0%
the balance of 430 back to
um

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
this bill 1661 but
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
the point i'm trying to make is i think
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
the house passed virtually all the
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
sections of
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 430 i think it came out of
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
your committee representative berger 20
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
to nothing so i'm kind of mystified as
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
to why it's a problem today
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
that it would be a problem for me and i
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
suspect for my senate colleagues
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
a big problem
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to address that one as
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
i've explained now multiple times the
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
issue is not
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
so much the content of the bill or it
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
we went we did not have a
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee or conference on the bill by
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
itself and that the senate chose to
 
00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:11.190 align:start position:0%
itself and that the senate chose to
non-concur

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
the number of items in the bill alone is
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
a problem for many on our caucus we've
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
had the discussion
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the more that is added to 1661
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
that the more that is added to 1661
um

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli mentioned it on
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
400 alone
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
when you have 400
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and 430 on it 430 as of now is not going
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
on anyway but the more you add on to
 
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.029 align:start position:0%
on anyway but the more you add on to
that

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
we are going to have
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
issues with our caucus now
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
i i attempted to explain that the the
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
senate has a little bit different
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
dynamic with 24 of you than
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have with over 200
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
a a vote if you will so the votes that
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
you're seeing
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
coming out of
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
finance is one thing what you saw on the
 
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
finance is one thing what you saw on the
floor

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:11.029 align:start position:0%
floor
is

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
totally unrelated to what actually went
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
on to get us to that point
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
of including
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
430 along with the floor amendment so
 
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.389 align:start position:0%
430 along with the floor amendment so
again

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
again
as

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
as of the moment
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
430 is not going to be part of this bill
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you were to
 
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.789 align:start position:0%
if you were to
say

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
we want 430 more than we want to attempt
 
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:37.909 align:start position:0%
we want 430 more than we want to attempt
to

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
go with
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
400 that might be an option but
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
400 as we've
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
as you've seen by the house floor boats
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
400 is not admired by the majority of
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
our caucus and some on the other side of
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the aisle so you want to start adding
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
all these things in there
 
00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
all these things in there
it's

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
well that would be unfortunate because
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to build a parking
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
garage but if we're at loggerheads i'd
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd like to just say
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
my two cents that
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
this bill was designed originally
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
and a result of
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
approximately five to six years of hard
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
work with the directors of the cte
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
centers throughout the state with the
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
advisory councils with business
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
trying to align what we're producing out
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
of our schools k through 12
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
a commodity which business and industry
 
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
a commodity which business and industry
manufacturing

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
recognize has the skills to
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
be successful in other words the student
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we need to double the number of
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
students we coming out of our high
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
school situations
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
with this skill understanding to
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
properly prepare and maintain industry
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
and manufacturing in the state
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we're not doing
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
it and this bill provides the
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students to attain the
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
graduation carnegie units the graduation
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
requirements the 20 required
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
for a student attending a cte course now
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
to get those credits not necessarily
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
through the sending school but in the
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
receiving center
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to avoid going to a
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
program because they have to remain home
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
at that sending school to receive that
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
one algebra course or that chemistry
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
course now it's embedded into the
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
courses and the programs the studies of
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
the cte
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
that program is is is critical
 
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.350 align:start position:0%
that program is is is critical
and

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
coupled with the emergency situation not
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't call it emergency but it
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
makes our garage much safer we all know
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
the condition that is in
 
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
the condition that is in
and

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a problem within the
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
next what is a problem right now so that
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
that is key
 
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:11.909 align:start position:0%
that is key
to

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think all of our positions right here
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
and we got to try to work together here
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
on this other stuff that's been added to
 
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
on this other stuff that's been added to
it

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh likened to that christmas tree
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
with too many bulbs on it i think has
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
represented our senator guy to mention
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor
 
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.310 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor
so

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
i would encourage us all to try to work
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
together to try to get to that in the
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
net that is resolved
 
00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:36.789 align:start position:0%
net that is resolved
um

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
so is there any further discussion on
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
this right now we will be resourcing for
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
our next one which is we're going to
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
have to come to the table with some
 
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:48.789 align:start position:0%
have to come to the table with some
answers

00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
so i suggest that we work carefully
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
together on that
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
as we have been doing senator bradley um
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
what time would you like to come back
 
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.549 align:start position:0%
what time would you like to come back
tomorrow

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
what is what time do these reports have
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
to be end to
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
three o'clock two is it just nine a.m i
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
would suggest nine o'clock too
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
and i would think we'd bring our lunch
 
00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
and i would think we'd bring our lunch
too

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:15.669 align:start position:0%
too
okay

00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
