00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
okay the hour being at 10 o'clock
 
00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
basically we're turning today over to
 
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 align:start position:0%
and so you all have decided who's going
 
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
to go where and when and all that kind
 
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
of stuff so I'll just say whoever's on
 
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
please come forward and do whatever it
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
good morning for record I'm Caitlin
 
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
Davis from the Department of Education
 
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
and we have a variety of presentations
 
00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the Department of
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
Education for some of the programs that
 
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
we oversee that are funded in the
 
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 align:start position:0%
education trust fund on the agenda today
 
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
tentatively first up we'll start with
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
career and Tech education and
 
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.449 align:start position:0%
career and Tech education and
transportation

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
related to those programs the next item
 
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
we have up on our agenda is special
 
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
education depending on timing
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
um and like in the morning we also plan
 
00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
to discuss lease Aid and public school
 
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund now that might get
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
pushed into the afternoon just kind of
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
depending on how many questions and
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatnot you all have for for the
 
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
department and then in the afternoon
 
00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend an intensive period
 
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
of time going over the education funding
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
formula and how it relates to the
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
various different recipients of those
 
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
education of that education funding
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so I think so you'll hear from each
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
of the staff that operate the programs
 
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
at the department and I think they'll
 
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
pretty much take questions as you all as
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
we go the point of today is for you all
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
to have a good understanding of how the
 
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
programs work and operate at the
 
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so that in about
 
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
a month from now when you start going
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
into this really heavy budget
 
00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 align:start position:0%
discussions you have a general
 
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the program works and
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
then so you can really just focus on
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
what are the impacts of various
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
decisions rather than trying to take
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
that time then and understand the
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
programs so each staff I think has some
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
handouts for you and we'll go through
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
those over the course of the day but you
 
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
know stop us let us know you have any
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
questions and you know we're all here to
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
support the committee so with that I'm
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to Jeff beard
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
who's the administrator of the career
 
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and and uh
 
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the committee
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm Dr Jeff beer does Caitlin
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm the state director for CTE
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
and the bureau administrator for the
 
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
Bureau of career development at the
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
Department of Education what I want to
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
do is just give a brief overview of
 
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education and three
 
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
major sources of funding for programs in
 
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
major sources of funding for programs in
CTE

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
CTE
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
so if you go to the first page of the
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
the handout CT is shorthand for Career
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
and Technical education we have about 30
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
CT centers that are Regional centers
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
located in high school public high
 
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
schools across the state in addition to
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
that there are CTE programs at the 70 uh
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
the seven community college is in the
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
ccsnh system CT includes a really wide
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
range of programming everything from
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
business building construction trades
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
Automotive trades cosmetology
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and criminal justice the
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
general I.T cluster engineering Advanced
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Health Sciences and really
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
it's an essential driver for the state's
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
economy it's a steady stream of skilled
 
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable workers that can go into
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state and provide
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
their their competence to help with the
 
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.409 align:start position:0%
 
importantly

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
um CT programs I'll quote myself here CT
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
programs prepare kids to be able to
 
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
enter into that job market with minimal
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
of the job training so the idea is that
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
by going through our typically two-year
 
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education programs
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
that kids would be able to take an
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
entry-level job at a company crucially
 
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire because we
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to as we know we've had
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
historically an out migration problem we
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
want to keep kids here we want to have
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
them have well-paying jobs they can then
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
contribute to the tax base by buying
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
homes and uh
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
in in our communities
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
um on the next page there's a
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately somewhat blurry map that
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
shows the uh the distribution of the
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
regional CT centers and the Community
 
00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:52.689 align:start position:0%
regional CT centers and the Community
College

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 align:start position:0%
College
 
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
Programs across the state
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
our most recent CT Center just came
 
00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
online last year up in Colebrook uh the
 
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
before I go into talking about the
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
Perkins Federal funding does anyone have
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
any general overview questions about
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
Career Technical Ed
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question about
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what it's called the
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
fast start or where you could go when
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
you're in high school you could go to
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
the local Community College do these
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
courses qualify as credit for those
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
programs absolutely yeah the the the
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
program that the Community College uh
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
has is called Running start
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
um and it provides young people the
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
um college credit while still in high
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
school one of the requirements of CTE
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
programs in New Hampshire at the high
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
school level is that young people are
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
able to earn either apprenticeship hours
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
hours towards licensure or college
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
credit while they're in high school so
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that's an integral part
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and just just a quick question
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know ice obviously this
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
is an alternative to going to college
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
for the kids that decided you know a
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
college degree is not really what they
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
are interested in and there will always
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
be you know not everybody needs to be a
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
college graduate
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
in your experience how close to being
 
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
ready to take a you know skilled job you
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
know are kids that finish uh you know
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
the city you were mentioning with
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
minimal on-the-job training where are
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
they you know in general terms are they
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
pretty much there and they just need a
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
bit of training to get the specific
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
needs of the employer or will they you
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
know is it the equivalent of getting two
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
years but they still in the significant
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
amount of support well uh to be honest
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's really a yes and proposition
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
um it CT is not an alternative city is a
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
is part of a career planning Career
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
Development process so a young person
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
could come out of some of our programs
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
ready to go immediately into a job a
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
good example would be young people that
 
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
go through health science programs earn
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
an LNA can work as a licensed nurse
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant right out of high
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
school our Auto Tech program students
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
will come out and are able to work at a
 
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.180 align:start position:0%
dealership uh working on cars
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we have programs like
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
biotechnology and computer programming
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
where there's probably some
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
post-secondary piece they're going to do
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
they could go into and again one of the
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
requirements is that there is the
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
entering immediately into a job however
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
um some fields that require some
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
post-secondary Education and Training
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
whether it's apprenticeship for the
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
trades most students come out of our
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
building construction trades programs
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
Electrical Plumbing construction with
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
some hours towards their apprenticeship
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
but they're not full apprentices and
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not Journeymen at that
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
point so there's going to be some
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
Education and Training that happens
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.420 --> 00:10:00.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely work-based learning is one of
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
the requirements for CTE programs in New
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there has to be some kind
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
of internship during the time that a
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
Young Person's in the program some of
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
those involve employers coming into
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
schools and supervising work which is a
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
simulated internship but we really
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
encourage the gold standards really
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
community-based authentic internships so
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely every single program has some
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
aspect of earlier before we started a
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
session we're talking a little bit about
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
teacher education and there are teacher
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
education programs in the CTE centers
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
that include student teaching so young
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
people whether they're deciding to work
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
with preschool-aged kids or Elementary
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
or middle school aged kids have an
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity within their school district
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
to go out and assist teachers learn
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
about instruction assessment all the
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
things that the teachers do so
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
internships and work-based learning is
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
an essential component of CTE
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
um maybe this isn't the time but at some
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
point will you speak about some of the
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
programs that have closed and why they
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
were closing I'm thinking particularly
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
the automotive program at Portsmouth
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
High which I think was shut down so if
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
you can give a sense of which programs
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
are growing which programs are not doing
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
well and perhaps your sense of why
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
either now or later on yeah absolutely
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative happy to happy to speak
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
to that the uh the decision
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
um is uh made at the local level so
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not to to keep a a course or
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
program of study running is really based
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
on local decisions at the state level
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
when we bring new programs on the first
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
thing that we look at is the economic
 
00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.470 align:start position:0%
thing that we look at is the economic
feasibility

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education has the
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
authority to approve new programs uh at
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
this at the local and state level we
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't shut programs down at the state
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
level if the local Says student interest
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
has waned over time
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
um we are having difficulty it's very
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
difficult to get CTE teachers because at
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
the end of the day CT teachers are
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
career Changers so they're people that
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
have made the decision to no longer work
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
and they're often much more lucrative
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
fields to become teachers and train up
 
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:16.700 align:start position:0%
the next generation of of of kids
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
what we will do at the department is
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
often encourage centers to really look
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
at the economic need to say in the
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
example of Automotive or in the example
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
of advanced manufacturing which is a
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
major sector in our state
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
consider what you can do to keep that
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
program online because it is so
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
all right uh so a major source of
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
federal funding for CT programs in New
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is Perkins and if you'll go to
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
the next page after the uh the state CTE
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
map the official term is strengthening
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
CT for the 21st century act each year
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gets about six million
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding that funding is based
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
on demographic data so when octay which
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
is our federal partner determines the
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
the funding they really base it on
 
00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
the funding they really base it on
population

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the entire New
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
England region gets about the same
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
allocation so Maine New Hampshire
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont we all get six million dollars
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
so we have about comparable populations
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
and we distribute the allocations to
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
leas or to the regional CTE centers
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
really based on a formula uh so it's
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
really the number of kids between the
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
ages of 5 and 17 served in the region
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
that are in poverty and that's based on
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
that safe data which is the the small
 
00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.710 align:start position:0%
that safe data which is the the small
area

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
um economic income and poverty
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
data that's provided by the U.S Bureau
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
of the census and then that's divided by
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
the total number of kids between the
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
ages of 5 and 17. that gives the the
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
allocation for each Center that goes out
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not based on
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
um enrollments it's not based on number
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
of programs or types of programs it's
 
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
strictly based on demographic data and
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
not just on the demographics of the town
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
in which the center is located but the
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh does does that
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
include rehab of these uh centers uh CT
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
centers and I imagine that would be
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
extra and where are we at as far as the
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
number of centers that we've rehabbed
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you asked that I'm going to get
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
to that later on because that's a
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
separate program those funds are State
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
funds that go to that the renovation and
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
the construction
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
but I but I will cover that in some
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
detail in in a little bit down the line
 
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
detail in in a little bit down the line
crucially

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
crucially
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
um only leas and the community college
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire are eligible
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
recipients of these funds that's per the
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
ACT those are considered the the local
 
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
um CTE schools per the definition of the
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
law Once Upon a Time Carl Perkins
 
00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.210 align:start position:0%
law Once Upon a Time Carl Perkins
awarded

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:04.220 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
scholarships I'm a recipient actually of
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
one I got my cigs at UNH and my Master's
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
at UNH
 
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.300 align:start position:0%
um on a full
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
assistantship do they still do things
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
like that I mean we need to encourage
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
more people to go into education
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
especially CTE it was a great perk for
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
me they even offered me to go get to
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
continue to go to Ohio State to get my
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
doctorate at that time I couldn't do it
 
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:31.790 align:start position:0%
doctorate at that time I couldn't do it
but

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so do they still do things like that
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
the the possibility to set up
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
scholarship funds the capacity is there
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk in a moment about the
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
the way that the the funding gets
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
distributed and there are some State
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
leadership activities that we're
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
required to spend funds on but any
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
recipient could decide to set up a
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund including ccsnh
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
they receive about a million dollars
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
annually from
 
00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:00.019 align:start position:0%
this grant
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
so the the breakdown of the Perkins
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
funds of the approximately 6 million
 
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.370 align:start position:0%
funds of the approximately 6 million
oh

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.670 align:start position:0%
oh
sorry

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory but it was apropos
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know Mary made me think of it a
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
little bit going using some of this for
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
your graduate work
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
um the way this is written there's an
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
implied assumption that
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
poor kids need ctes more in than other
 
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.750 align:start position:0%
poor kids need ctes more in than other
students

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.769 align:start position:0%
students
um

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
is that just an implied assumption is
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
there another way of doing it or is
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
there there it's a I just made the
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
thought makes me a little bit
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable because there may be other
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
kids who would like to go into a career
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
and it's not because you know they're
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
like from a poor area can you just kind
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
of correct me in my thinking here and
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
how these things are distributed or
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
thought about that's a great question in
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
terms of access New Hampshire is really
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated to making sure that everyone
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
has access to CTE we acknowledge that
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
it's a valuable opportunity for career
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
development for any kid no matter of of
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
zip code or where they're coming from
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
the um the way that the the funding
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
allocation does work out is because it
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
is based on population and demographics
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
which again is prescribed in in the law
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the federal law it tends to be this
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
combination of population density and
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
number of people in poverty so
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester quite frankly will always get
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
the largest allocation because it's the
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
largest community it has the largest
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of people in poverty
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that said there are a number of other
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.850 align:start position:0%
um that said there are a number of other
communities

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
um Wolfeboro being one that has a
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
regional CT center that is a relatively
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
affluent area that's serving a large
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of students so the the access and
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to access high quality
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
programming is
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
um is definitely something that that we
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
strive for across the state and as I
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more in the future
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
about transportation that does become a
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
challenge but by and large the the
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
ability to access CT is not impeded by
 
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.210 align:start position:0%
ability to access CT is not impeded by
where

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
where someone lives
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you if I just sort of add
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
there's I try to get past that
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
assumption that these schools are for
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
those kids who aren't smart enough to go
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
to college which was an old you know
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
bromide and to get past that uh that
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
that basically that prejudice that I
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
think sticks with us a little bit yeah
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's well said and that is something
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
that does that does persist uh something
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the CT centers and the directors
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
have been very involved in as the
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
department has been as well is really uh
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
trying to convey to decision makers who
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
are going to be parents that CTE is a
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
great option for anyone and that it will
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
always give someone an advantage over
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
someone who has not taken part in CTE
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
there's a large number there's some
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
national level data about
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
um college going for young people who
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
have been through CT versus not and uh
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
70 of CTE participants do go on to to
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
some level of two or four-year College
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
which is not to say that that is that
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
the necessarily the desired outcome it's
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
really whatever
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
um wherever someone finds himself on
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
their career development
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
pathway it should be something that
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
meets their their interests their needs
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
and their ability to participate in the
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
economy thank you for being sensitive to
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
that you're welcome
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
so the way that the the Perkins
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
breakdown works and this this gets a
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
little tricky so I'm happy to entertain
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
some questions about it but essentially
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
um there's five percent of that six
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
million is used for administrative costs
 
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education so it's
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
things like my salary the the cost of of
 
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:42.260 align:start position:0%
leasing our suite of offices
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications it's really sort of
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
what you might think of as indirect
 
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.510 align:start position:0%
what you might think of as indirect
costs

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
um and that again that's prescribed in
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
in Perkins you can use five percent or
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
you states have to use five percent of
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
their Perkins allocation for
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
then there's 10 percent used for State
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
leadership activities so if you think
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
about it you'd think well uh six million
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
dollars that's quite a bit of money but
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
10 of that really is not a whole lot we
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
end up with about 600 000. of that 10
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
there are some set of sides that are
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the law so for example we
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
have to set aside
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um 10 of the ten percent so sixty uh
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
thousand to prepare uh individuals for
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
occupations and careers that are
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
non-traditional for their gender so the
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
idea would be young women in Auto Tech
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
young women in welding young women in
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
construction young men in healthcare
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
young men in cosmetology young men in in
 
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
young men in cosmetology young men in in
education

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
so we have to have some some funds that
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
we use for that purpose the way that the
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has done that for
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
the last two years is we've contracted
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
with monster in worldwide the uh the job
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
aggregator to run a series of targeted
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
social media ads where if someone's say
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
scrolling through Facebook or Instagram
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
they'll see or Twitter they'll see an ad
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
they can click on it and it says here's
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
information about employment
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
opportunities and training opportunities
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
for if say you're a young woman
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
interested in getting into becoming an
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
electrician you can connect with that
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
in addition we have to spend
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
um a um a set amount it ends up being
 
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.789 align:start position:0%
um a um a set amount it ends up being
125

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
125
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
000 on State institutions and the way
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
that state institutions are defined in
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
the ACT New Hampshire really only has
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
one which is the Department of
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections systems we have the men's
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
and women's facility here in Concord we
 
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
have the facility in Berlin and there's
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
a a set of CTE
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
courses and and opportunities that are
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
happening in each so here in Concord
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
there's a culinary arts program there's
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program there's a graphic
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
design program and there's a general
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
business program where people learn how
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
to use Excel word and the basic uh the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
basic Microsoft Office things that will
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
prepare them for employment post
 
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.870 align:start position:0%
prepare them for employment post
incarceration

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
um in addition part of our state
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
leadership funding as you may may know
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's a state law that requires that
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
every young person in the state take a
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
career inventory by the end of ninth
 
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.169 align:start position:0%
career inventory by the end of ninth
grade

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
um so in order to make that not an
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate we're using out of our
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
Perkins funding money to pay for a way
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
to which is a career interest inventory
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
any questions about the state leadership
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
before I go on to
 
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.510 align:start position:0%
before I go on to
okay

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
um this is the the part that can be a
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
little confusing so the remaining 85
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
percent gets distributed to the eligible
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
recipients uh and there is a split
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
between the community college system and
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh the high schools so it's a 21 and uh
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
0.5 it goes to the community college
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
system uh the remaining 79 and a half
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
goes to the the Regional High School CT
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
centers but before that happens we're
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in Perkins hold up to 15 of the total
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
allocation in reserve we've chosen to do
 
00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.529 align:start position:0%
allocation in reserve we've chosen to do
10

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:23.539 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
and what we do and again that's 10 of
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
that total not of the 85 but it gets
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
held back from the 85.
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
um so it's about
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
um it ends up being about uh 500 000
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's held in reserve
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
what we do with that is we distribute
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
that in the form of uh competitive Grant
 
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.289 align:start position:0%
that in the form of uh competitive Grant
competition

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
competition
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
um that we do twice a year once in the
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
fall once in the spring the purpose of
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
this grant competition is to fund
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
activities at the regional CT centers or
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
the community college that increase the
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
number of Industry recognized
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
credentials earned by uh by students so
 
00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credentials are ircs
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
include things like licenses badges
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
certificates an apprenticeship card
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
would be an IRC essentially an IRC is
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
something that if you have it on your
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
resume it gets you in line for a job and
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
gives you some preference over a
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
candidate that does not hold the IRC
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
and so finally about four million
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
dollars gets distributed to the among
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
the 30 Regional CTE centers and then
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars goes to ccs and
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
age which then gets distributed among
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
the seven Community College uh in the
 
00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:38.029 align:start position:0%
the seven Community College uh in the
system

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
so what can they use the funding for
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
they can use it to buy equipment
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
professional development for for
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
teachers promote work-based learning and
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
the earning of those industry recognized
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
credentials a large amount of the the
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
Perkins funding does go to equipment
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
um I'll talk more about this as we get
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
into tuition Transportation but CTE is
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
more expensive than non-cte running a
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
current technical education program like
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
an auto program will cost a school
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
district a great deal more money than
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
running a math program or an English
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
program in the same high school so they
 
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
do use quite a bit of it for equipment
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
professional development is an important
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
piece of this because CTE again has some
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
unique needs classroom management in a a
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
busy CTE space where there's major
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
safety concerns is very different than
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
classroom management in a non-ct setting
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
um really important principle and you'll
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
hear this probably from other folks uh
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
today that talk about Federal funding
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
Federal funding has to supplement local
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
funding it cannot supplant and replace
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
it so if there was something that was
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
being covered with local money or
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-federal money in the past you can't
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
then use federal funds to to then pick
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
up that cost that's a a general
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
any questions about the Perkins funding
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
before I go into tuition transportation
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay so uh tuition
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh colloquially known as
 
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.890 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh colloquially known as
TNT

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
TNT
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
um nine million dollars uh each year
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
comes from um from the state of New
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this goes into the general
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
um every student in the state is
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for TNT funding so public
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
school students non-public school
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
students homeschooled students there is
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
a a piece in the RSA that that's Rel
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
related to transportation that does know
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
the District of residence is responsible
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
for transportation which is then
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the the department so in
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
the case of non-public school students
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
or homeschooled students it's where they
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
live that covers the cost of
 
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
transportation to CTE
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
um transportation is paid to sending
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
districts first and then the remaining
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
costs for tuition come later
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and as I talk more about it well
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
transportation is a fairly significant
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
cost uh in the in the the last fiscal
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
year we paid out 682 000 in
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
transportation costs of that 9 million
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
tuition cost is a much more significant
 
00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:16.130 align:start position:0%
tuition cost is a much more significant
cost

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
but uh crucially the nine million
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
dollars is used by New Hampshire for
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort with uh Perkins so
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
Perkins has a provision in the act that
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
says that you must level fund your state
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
effort if it dips below it we run the
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
risk of losing the 6 million in federal
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
funding so what that means is is is if
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
there is ever an increase in tuition and
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
transportation it goes above the 9
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars it must remain level
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
funded at whatever the increase is in
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
order to continue to meet the
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
so again for FY 23 which covered the
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
2122 school year CTE transportation that
 
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:00.980 align:start position:0%
we reimbursed to
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
sending districts was 682 000 118.33 but
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
importantly this was based on a rate set
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Board of Education
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
um quite a long time ago
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um it at least a decade ago the current
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
rate that's set and this is in in
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
statute and in rules is 10 cents per
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
student per mile for a bus
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
and 25 cents per per mile rather for
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
self-transporting so in the case of a
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
young person who's driving themselves to
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
CTE or their parents dropping them off
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's 25 cents a mile current federal
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
rate for mileage reimbursement I believe
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
is something in the area of 60 cents a
 
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:48.649 align:start position:0%
is something in the area of 60 cents a
mile

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh tuition uh is calculated by a
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
percentage the doe 25 is that cost per
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
pupil rate that's calculated annually by
 
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.070 align:start position:0%
pupil rate that's calculated annually by
districts

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
districts choose they look at their
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
their needs they look at the cost of
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
running CT programs and they decide is
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
their rate going to be 20 of that Doe 25
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
all the way up to 40 percent of that Dua
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
25. this varies by
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
um by CT Center and they make the
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
termination based on a number of factors
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
including things like energy cost
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
equipment that they're running supplies
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
for programs again a welding program
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
costs more than a teacher education
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
program in terms of supplies needed
 
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.510 align:start position:0%
program in terms of supplies needed
um

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
the idea is essentially that that CTE is
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
more expensive than non-ct
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
so it's it's going to cost more
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
um or somebody to attend a CTE program
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
than not attending a CT program because
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
of the equipment costs the energy cost
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
the supplies cost so on and so forth
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
right now the majority of CTE students
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
attend a high school in which the
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
regional CT Center is located
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
so there there are sending school
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
students that come within regions to go
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
to CT centers a great example would be
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
Concord right here the crtc in Concord
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
they have eight sending high schools
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
they probably have the most in the state
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
followed by Seacoast School of
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
Technology in Exeter which has seven but
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
really by and large the majority of CTE
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
students attend the high school in which
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
and in the um the last fiscal year that
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
we made payments uh 8 million one
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
hundred twenty three thousand six
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
hundred nineteen dollars and seventy
 
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman right uh can you
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
can uh sending District split that uh
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
where they send their students
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
say if one program doesn't one like
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
kings would
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
versus uh Tri-City
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
one offers certain things and the other
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
one can I split that yes yeah I'm glad
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
you asked the uh the way that the the
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
RSA is written um and then the the
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
attending and minister of rules is if
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
the CTE program is not offered within
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
the the center that that's being served
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
that a student may attend another Center
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll cover those the
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
department will cover those
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
now two quick questions
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
um if the student attends the high
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
school which holds the CTE Center do
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
they still get the tuition or the
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
transportation reimbursement
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
they do not there's a couple um
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that though
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
um Exeter Manchester Nashua all have
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
um they don't have high schools that are
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
sending to the CT sector the CT center
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
is right there but they do have some
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation happening so in the
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
example of Exeter extra high schools up
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
the road from SST so they do get
 
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
the road from SST so they do get
Transportation

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
reimbursements but in the case of a
 
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.020 align:start position:0%
student who's walking down the hallway
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
to to attend CT that they would not get
 
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.490 align:start position:0%
to to attend CT that they would not get
transportation

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
and is it time for the Board of
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
Education to consider raising the
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
transportation rate if it hasn't been
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
done and there's such a difference
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
between what we do and what the federal
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
government does that's a great question
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
um there does need to be a change to
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Ladd has a
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
bill um in this current session that um
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
that seeks to do that so it really is a
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh it's a multi-part uh step of the the
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the current law uh directly and the
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that goes along with
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
it directly refers to that rate that was
 
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.490 align:start position:0%
it directly refers to that rate that was
set

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
um so in order for the rate to be reset
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
the law has to be amended so it's a sort
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
of a one two three then we'll be able to
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
so quick question on the
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
tuition rate I just want to make sure I
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
understood it correctly since it's the
 
00:32:57.409 --> 00:32:57.419 align:start position:0%
first time I uh you know get exposed to
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
this the
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
local authorities that have cd centers
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
are basically deciding what additional
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
payments are needed to supplement their
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
tuition and that's between 20 and 40
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent but it's them who make the
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
calculations or does the state approve
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
those because I would assume there's got
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
to be a check from the state that the
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
you know increases the requested rate is
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
reasonable correct every uh every fall
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
the the schools will submit to us their
 
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
proposed rate and then we we approve
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
that rate but the uh to to clarify the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
um the tuition is a percentage of that
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
Doe 25. it's again it's based on the
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
idea that the tuition is based on a full
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
day of school but that young person is
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
for part of the day going to the CTE
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
Center yep yep understand one
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
separate question we were talking
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
earlier about you know the funding for
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Perkins being the tied to Poverty
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
rates among other factors and I'm just
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
trying to understand whether the intent
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
legislation based on your interpretation
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
obviously because nobody can read the
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
mind of the feds but
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
what's the intent to steer more you know
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
low-income students into City or just to
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
adjust for the fact that likely they
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
would have a harder time thing paying
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
for it and make those opportunities
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
available to everybody but send more
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
financially to the people who need
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
financial aid rather than to you know
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
the people who need financial aid less I
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe the latter is the intent is to
 
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
to make more opportunities available and
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
that again acknowledging that CTE can be
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
an expensive proposition it was intended
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
to give some some assistance to leas so
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
that they can provide high quality CT
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
my question I'm a newbie here so I
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
apologize for a really Elemental
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
question I'm about to ask you could you
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
explain doe 25 what is that I can
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
attempt to okay
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
Caitlin may be able to fill in the
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
blanks a little bit on this but
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
essentially there's a per pupil uh raid
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's set by every uh Lea across the
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
state and the doe 25 is is essentially
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is the cost per pupil here's how
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
much it costs to educate a young person
 
00:35:21.849 --> 00:35:21.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
nuances I'm sure just a quick question
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um tell me the um enrollment across the
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
state for uh the total well CTE centers
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely uh representative
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we fluctuate between 9 500 and 10 000
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
students and we're pretty
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and I've looked at the the 10-year uh
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
Trend and it's generally speaking around
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
9 500 students
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
um there was a little shift about five
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
years ago where there was a law that was
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
introduced previous to that you had to
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
have completed two years of high school
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
before entering CTE when the law was
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
amended it allowed young people to enter
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
after completing one year of high school
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we still have yet to see a
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
significant bump in part of the reason
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
for that is that young people have so
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
many graduation requirements that they
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to fulfill that when they are able
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
to consider CTE they have to make sure
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
that they've satisfied English math
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
science so on and so forth
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
now you have another question because
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
what you just said years ago I used to
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
work in CTE
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it was called
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
something different back then
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things that was my job
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
was to align certain vocational classes
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
for academic credit for example um in I
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
did a biology credit for Health Sciences
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we did um oh just a a math credit
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
for uh lead the way does that happen
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
because that just seems like a simple
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
way to encourage more kids to go where
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
they'd get the dual kind of credit for
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
participating in those courses I'm glad
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you asked that question absolutely it
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
happens uh quite a bit
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
um and something that will help with
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
that is HB 1661 was passed last
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislative session it allows for a
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that's in the regional CTE
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
agreements that requires a statement of
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
how local districts will accept evidence
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
of Competency and then award partial or
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
full credit toward graduation for things
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
that are completed in CTE
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I do have an additional piece and for
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
whatever reason when I printed off my
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
packet it looks like it was left off so
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna grab my uh attache
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
and see if it's in there because I do
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
want to talk about renovation and
 
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:58.849 align:start position:0%
want to talk about renovation and
construction

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I apologize for that for whatever
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
reason that last part was left off uh my
 
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
original test copy had it my copies do
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
not but I'll give you the overview and
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
then I can provide it to you at a later
 
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.329 align:start position:0%
then I can provide it to you at a later
date

00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
so the um the the other major uh source
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
of CTE funding
 
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:19.940 align:start position:0%
um is uh CTE Center renovation
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
historically that has come from the
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
capital budget however there's no
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirement in statute that the funding
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
does come from the capital budget there
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's opportunities for other ways to
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
fund this
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules for CTE it's a
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
1303 is the the actual admin rule
 
00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:41.890 align:start position:0%
1303 is the the actual admin rule
citation

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:41.900 align:start position:0%
citation
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
it has it established a priority list
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
for CTE Center renovation and that's
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
based on earliest date of construction
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
to most recent
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the the centers that are still in
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
line to be renovated there's a current
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget request from the
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
Department for a project in winnesquam
 
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
Department for a project in winnesquam
Tilton

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
Tilton
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then there's another project that's
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
proposed for Newport
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
the um the the major development in
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
winnerscom is that it was a regional
 
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579 align:start position:0%
subcenter so that at one point in
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
history there were agricultural
 
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
history there were agricultural
sub-centers

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
sub-centers
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
Fall Mountain which is over in Langdon
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
and then winnesquam
 
00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
had fewer programs and they were
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
strictly agricultural
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
they've since expanded so in the last
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
year wintersquam
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
applied for their renovation funding and
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
as part of that renovation funding
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
request they had asked to include two
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
new programs so in that in that proposal
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
they had included an advanced
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing program which is a major
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
economic need in that area as well as a
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program just as an aside
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
cosmetology is is kind of an interesting
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
program because it doesn't show up in
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
labor market data and the reason it
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't is that labor market data is
 
00:40:10.569 --> 00:40:10.579 align:start position:0%
largely based on Employment Security
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
data and employment security data is
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
based on people paying workers
 
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.569 align:start position:0%
based on people paying workers
compensation

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
so any independent contractors will not
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
show up in workers compensation data
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
because they don't
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
the businesses don't pay pay that
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology licensed cosmetologists
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
people that cut and style hair do nails
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
Etc are all essentially independent
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
contractors and so for that reason when
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
you go to look at labor market data it
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit more tricky with
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
cosmetology than when something say like
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
Auto technology where you can look at
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
all the dealerships and see how many
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
employed that said it's a a well-paying
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
vital career path and the thing I always
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
say I said this to House Ed myself
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
excluded you can tell by looking at me
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't go to hair salons a whole
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
lot but for the most part most people
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
have been in the last month or so and
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
just as a sort of anecdotal thing you
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
just a quick question seeing how
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
cosmetology is one of the many
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
professions that requires a license for
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
people to be able to earn a living can
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
you give me an idea of how far along the
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
licensing path does taking a CTE course
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
in that get you excellent question all
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
of our cosmetology programs give someone
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
one year toward the license so by the
 
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
time that the students finish every
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
student another thing that's a little
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
unique about Cosmetology in New
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that the salons within the
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
CT centers are licensed cosmetology
 
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.230 align:start position:0%
CT centers are licensed cosmetology
salons

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
salons
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
and the teachers are actually triple uh
 
00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:47.579 align:start position:0%
licensed they're licensed as CTE
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
teachers so they have the state
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
credential they're also licensed
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology instructors which is a Board
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
of Cosmetology requirement and they're
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
also licensed cosmetologists so they
 
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:00.500 align:start position:0%
have that triple uh credentialing
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
there are a couple centers and I don't
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
want to misspeak but I know that Dover
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
is one of them where the students come
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
out with their license so they actually
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
earn sufficient hours that they can come
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
out and have the the credential and are
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
so for the um the the renovation
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
projects uh the um the request is is
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
um a couple details so the um the state
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
will pay up to 75 percent of the costs
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
of renovating a CT Center
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
the um the priority is based on that
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
that cue that was established in the
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
admin rules
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
but that's predicated on the locals uh
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
securing 25 of the funding so they have
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
to do that by vote they have to do that
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
um in advance of getting approved for
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
the project what that means is that
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes communities don't have
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
sufficient votes to secure the 25
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
percent to get a bond and then they move
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
down uh the queue we have five centers
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
that have not yet been renovated there's
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
still up for uh for renovation and in
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
order Newport and winnesquam which I
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned before currently have projects
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
um in the the process of having funds
 
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.450 align:start position:0%
um in the the process of having funds
requested

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:22.460 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
then Milford
 
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.170 align:start position:0%
then Milford
Claremont

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.309 align:start position:0%
Claremont
and

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
and Peterborough thank you so
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
Peterborough was slated for the next
 
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.069 align:start position:0%
Peterborough was slated for the next
biennium

00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:38.569 align:start position:0%
biennium
um

00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
the the cost of renovating has become a
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
bit of a challenge over the last two
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
years as you you can imagine with
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
construction costs going up so much so
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place to adjust uh
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
the request if it comes in at a larger
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
that was originally estimated but the
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
way it works is it's based on a
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so there is a monthly
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
report that comes to the department
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
where they will say these are the costs
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
so we we reimburse for actual costs so
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
we don't give that 75 that gets funded
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
we don't grant that to a community up
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
front it's based on a reimbursement
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
model where they submit the the actual
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
costs it gets reviewed by my office and
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
additional equipment like let's say uh
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
like I know Kinks would start a
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
machinist program or restart a machinist
 
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
program now is there any additional
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
monies provided to buy that equipment
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
like CNC machines or whatever that's
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
part of the renovation so again the way
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
that things are are worded currently is
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
that the renovation is sort of an All or
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
Nothing proposition where the entire
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
Center gets renovated at once that does
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
include equipment upgrades uh typically
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
the annual Perkins uh is how most
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
centers uh fund equipment repairs and
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
and Replacements if they are approved
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
for a renovation project they include
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
all the costs needed to upgrade
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
one thing I miss was your name oh uh Dr
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
Jeff beard
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
I think you said it but I didn't have
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything to broadcast
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
you I think you're winning
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh because my understanding the student
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
population has
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
plummeted over the last 10 years and if
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're steady at 9 500 that means you're
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm so I'm so glad you noted that
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative Emrick it's uh it is
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that as um as the
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
student population across the the state
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
for high school students has continued
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
to decrease uh CT has remained constant
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of that is due to uh to
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
the efforts of uh the CTE community in
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
raising awareness one thing that we've
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
done at the department level is really
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
increased a lot of Outreach and a lot of
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
direct marketing
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
um work to parents because parents are
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
the decision makers the other piece that
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
we looked at was again going back to our
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
Perkins funding one of our set of sizes
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
to recruit members of special
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
populations there are a number of
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
special populations including people
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
um

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
but a crucial uh segment of a special
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
population for the state of New
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are English language Learners
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
and often just as uh non-english
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
language learner communities the parents
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
are the decision makers about education
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's very true about
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
um about New American and immigrant
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
communities so doing Outreach in the
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
form of we took our CTE brochures and
 
00:46:45.609 --> 00:46:45.619 align:start position:0%
translated them into Spanish Portuguese
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
Swahili and Arabic which are the four
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
major language groups of ell folks in
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
the state made those available to school
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
counselors to distribute to to families
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
and to kids so they could be informed
 
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:00.500 align:start position:0%
about the possibilities of CTE
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:02.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
with what you just said it popped into
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
my head are these available for adult
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
Learners as well if you're having a
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
career change someone who wishes to you
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
know go into one of these programs do
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
um non you know not the young people but
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
adult Learners representative Murray
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
your time may not be better uh
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
so uh the uh the Bureau of adult
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
education and the career development
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau we're we're co-funding a pilot
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
that we're calling CTE after dark it's a
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of misnomer it could happen
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
during the day it could happen when the
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
sun's out but the idea is to make
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
available again because of capacity
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
issues some of our CTE programs in high
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
schools can are capped at 14
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
participants because of safety so an
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity could be to offer CTE
 
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.430 align:start position:0%
opportunity could be to offer CTE
programming

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
programming
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
um say three to five pm and adult
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
Learners and high school students could
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
both work on say an auto shop uh Auto
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
Tech program a computer science program
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
so we're funding that over the next year
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have four applicants for the the RFP
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
that we put out I'm hoping to to pick a
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
winner and roll out the pilot over the
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
next school year
 
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.750 align:start position:0%
next school year
okay

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're very welcome
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record it's Amy
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
Clark from the Department of Education
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
um I promise it's not as complicated as
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
building Aid so I have two other
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
programs that I'm gonna
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
talk to you about today I'll wait for
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:42.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:49:42.849 --> 00:49:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
so the first packet is Lisa there's two
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
of them and just the title is at the top
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that's how you'll find it there it's
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
the skinnier of the two packets
 
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
the skinnier of the two packets
uh

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.849 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
um this is just a cover page so my
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
contact information is there in case
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
and so the second page is that program
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
summary again I like to fit my whole
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
program on one page so if you just need
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
to go one page here it is uh the
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
um again contact information the laws
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the rules are there where you'll
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
find the lease Aid laws also in RSA 198
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
15 HH section HH
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a couple of sentences really
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
it essentially says so this is buried in
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
that building Aid law 198 15 is building
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
Aid So within building Aid there was a
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
section created in my mind it was
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
created because we had building aid for
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
if you owned land and you were going to
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
build a building then you apply for
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
building Aid and at some point somebody
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
said well what happens if you lease a
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
building so then this part came into
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
building Aid and it does require a
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
separate appropriation so keep that in
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
mind building Aid is one appropriation
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
lisade is a separate appropriation
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
and then what lease Aid is really is
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's for uh charter schools are our
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
school buildings that lease uh most
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
commonly lease spaces at one time uh
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
some Career and Technical Education
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
Centers were included there but now the
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
regulations separate uh the
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation is specific to Charter
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
Schools so that's what we'll talk about
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
today so lease Aid is really just those
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
State Grant funds to help uh school
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
districts in this case charter schools
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
with a portion of their lease and that
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
portion in law is stated as 30 percent
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
of their lease payment their annual
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
lease payment up to fifty thousand
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
dollars maximum that maximum has changed
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
over the years and we'll talk about that
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
right in a little bit but that is the
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
cap on lease Aid currently
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh the funding source I know that we're
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
here talking about the education trust
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
fund but the funding source actually is
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the general funds for these uh for
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
these lease aid funds I think the
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
thought is to get that transferred over
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund eventually
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're including it today
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
um the history of lisaid is really it
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
was created in 2003 but was never funded
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
until fiscal 20. uh so again put into
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
law but really nobody applied we had no
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
funds for it in the first appropriation
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
came in fiscal 20. and then there's that
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
little table there I'm just going to
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
take you through that table I think it
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much tells you that all the
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
history of Lisa that you're going to
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
want to know uh First Column is fiscal
 
00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:39.890 align:start position:0%
want to know uh First Column is fiscal
year

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
second column is how much the
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
legislature appropriated
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
you can see it's two hundred thousand
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and then five hundred thousand
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
dollars thereafter uh then the third
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
column is the number of schools that
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
applied for lease Aid
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
and unlike building Aid it's not a first
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
come first serve it's everybody
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
um gets a portion of the lease Aid that
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
was appropriated so everybody gets 30
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
percent up to 50 000 if we don't have
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
enough money everybody's prorated across
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the the big the first big number
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
column there I guess it's the fourth
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
column is the total amount of eligible
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
lease payments this isn't the grant
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
amount this is the actual eligible
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
amount of lease payments
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
um similarly to school building
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
construction things like maintenance are
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
not included in building Aid similarly
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
in leases we have to go through and have
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
them separate any kind of Maintenance
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
costs so maintenance costs are not are
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
one example of things that are not
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
eligible for lease Aid so if you
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
subtract out of those things we received
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
on in fiscal 20 we received 20
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
applications with 2.5 million dollars of
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh annual lease payments seeking a grant
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the next column is the actual amount of
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
Grant if
 
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.650 align:start position:0%
Grant if
um

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
if we had enough money so those 20
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
applications for fiscal 20 were seeking
 
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.569 align:start position:0%
applications for fiscal 20 were seeking
454

00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
454
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
000 we only were appropriated two
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars so all the
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
payments across the board were prorated
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
down to 44 everybody received 44 of
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
their payment
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to know what the shortage is
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
that year we were short 252 000
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so the next fiscal year there was an
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
adjustment made
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you can see the next year was five
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars 16 schools
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
applied and right across the board that
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
year they were requesting 382
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
000 we had enough to make that payment
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
so we actually paid everybody what the
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
law allowed and we weren't short any
 
00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:50.329 align:start position:0%
law allowed and we weren't short any
money

00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
um some and I you know I can take you
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
through all four rows but I I think you
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
can see the picture there a couple of
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
things to note
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
um some odd numbers that might jump out
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
at you fiscal 20 to fiscal 21 why do we
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
have 20 leases and then the next year
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
only 16.
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a com it's not like four schools
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
just dropped off the it was actually a
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
combination of things
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
I think two schools closed uh and I
 
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
think three schools purchased
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
um one school didn't end up applying uh
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
so that's maybe like six schools and
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
then we added a couple of schools so the
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
difference there is four so for a few
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at the row where it
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
says total lease amount eligible
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
um one thing to note is that part of
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
lease Aid is if you're a first time
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
charter school and you're starting up
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
those construction costs to for that
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
leased building are eligible for lease
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
Aid and so if you look down that column
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see 2.5 million 2.5 million 2.7 and
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
then there was a big jump in fiscal 23
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
of 4.2 million that's because we had a
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
charter school had about a million
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
dollars of startup costs 1.1 million
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
dollars of construction to bring that
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
building up to for startup costs
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
interestingly none of that was actually
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
covered by lease Aid because the cap in
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
their lease payment 30 in their lease
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
payment was already fifty thousand
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars so we really covered the 30 and
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
none of that construction cost was
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually covered
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
because it exceeded the cap but that is
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
why you might see that jump in that
 
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.130 align:start position:0%
why you might see that jump in that
number

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
and then going through some other notes
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
um the cap used to be 30 000 uh for
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 and 21. that's why you some of
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
the proration is a little different but
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
then the cap
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
um is now fifty thousand dollars for a
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 and 23 and and it's currently
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly I guess I'll just
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
um some people ask what are we going to
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
get for the next what are we looking at
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
forecasting for the next biennium we
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
have Charter Schools coming on board
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
um often
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and so we are expecting five new
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
schools this year we have received their
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
we know that they're coming but full
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
applications on all that detailed
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
information isn't due until September
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
but if we make rough numbers let me just
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
assume all five are going to meet that
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
cap at fifty thousand then we're going
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
to need an extra 250 000 we have seen
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're preliminary applications and
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
they're actually instead of 250 000
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're closer to 125 000 due to our
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
estimates on their spaces that they're
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
renting uh we also anticipate some
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
leases aren't the same payment every
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
year and the increase from 22 23 from
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
just the group that we're paying on now
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
was about 100 000 so if we just add all
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
of those numbers up
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
um the request for lease Aid is likely
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
going to be anywhere from 875
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
000 to a million dollars for Lisa that's
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
what we're anticipating for
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
a total Grant amount and then we're just
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
going to wait and see what the
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so the um the 47 million
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
dollar grant that was a federal Grant
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
was for startups
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
for startup Charter Schools is that
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
correct is that are we still using that
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
or is that I believe so that does not
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
include construction costs is my
 
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.930 align:start position:0%
include construction costs is my
understanding

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:59.809 align:start position:0%
understanding
okay

00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.849 --> 00:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:07.069 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
foreign

00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm looking at the table
 
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:11.630 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm looking at the table
um

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
which has quite a few charter schools
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
that appear to be eligible for release
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
Aid and are not applying
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
do we have an understanding why they're
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
choosing to uh quote unquote leave money
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
on the table here because
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
it is rather surprising to me that
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
somebody who is eligible wouldn't apply
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there are reasons why I'd
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
be curious to you know hear your
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that uh we have um I'd have
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
to pull the files on these but we
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually did go back and ask each of
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
those Charter Schools why they didn't
 
00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.349 align:start position:0%
those Charter Schools why they didn't
apply

00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
um let's see there's one two three
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
there's five schools that look like that
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for Lisa that did
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
not apply uh and it's hard to say so
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
there's probably two
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
two hurdles I want to call them hurdles
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that they could be fully
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
defined as hurdles but uh one of them is
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
that you have to have a lawyer review
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
your lease and I know that that was one
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
of the responses that they did not have
 
01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:09.299 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to review their lease and then
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
I do know other responses where you have
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
to have your proper documentation that
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
you have a certificate of occupancy that
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can have proper permitting for the
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
space that you're in as well as your
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
space is a public school remember
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
charter schools are public schools
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're required to be ADA Compliant and
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
so part of that proof of ADA compliancy
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
is that you have had
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
um an architect or somebody familiar
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
with the Ada regulations come in and
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
create a certification that the
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
statement that the facility is ADA
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
Compliant and so for new new Charter
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
Schools we actually require that at
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
startup but some of these are older
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools and didn't provide that
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
documentation at the time they got out
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one quick follow-up I
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
am not aware what is the universe of
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
charter schools in New Hampshire what is
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
the like total population how many are
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
we talking about oh that's great
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
question unfortunately I'm not in the
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
charter school program so I don't know
 
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:23.810 align:start position:0%
my question more and more every year
 
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
my question more and more every year
[Laughter]

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last page I have for
 
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.530 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last page I have for
you

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
um is really just a list of all the
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
charter schools so that'll at least give
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
you the list of the active Charter
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
Schools uh and we put them on there
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
whether they received lease eight or not
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
and again some are not receiving Lisa
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
because they own their own buildings
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
some are um paid forth by other means uh
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
and um so that kind of gives you their
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 fiscal 23 history on here
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
because of that cap if you take your
 
01:01:59.099 --> 01:02:00.349 align:start position:0%
because of that cap if you take your
your

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
um lease you divide or the cap which is
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
50 000 you divide it by that 30 percent
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
for quick numbers essentially you're at
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
a hundred and sixty six thousand dollar
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
lease anything else above that you'll
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
get capped so if you so let me say that
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
again if your lease if the school has an
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
annual lease of greater than 166
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
666 dollars 66 cents if you're greater
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
than that that annual payment then
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
you'll be subject to that cap right I
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
take 30 of that I'll get fifty thousand
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
dollars so in this list
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you have essentially five
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
five schools that are subject to that
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
cap there might be a couple like there's
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
a hundred and sixty nine thousand I
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
think they're you know they get shorted
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
about 800 bucks because of the cap or
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
something like that but you have Academy
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
signs for the design creva strong
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
foundations The Birches Academy and
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
Wyndham uh Academy public charter they
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
those five schools received
 
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
substantially less than 30 percent
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
because they are subject to the cap
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but everybody else uh the cap for the
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
most part covers their uh the 30 covers
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
their portion of Lee said
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
if um in a small town their public
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
school closed and they reauthorized the
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
school as a charter
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
the lease expenses that the town charges
 
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
for that Charter would be covered under
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
this payment is that correct uh can you
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
say that again the the if a town had a
 
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.930 align:start position:0%
say that again the the if a town had a
school

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
an elementary school for example and it
 
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.730 align:start position:0%
an elementary school for example and it
closed

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
police they would they were leasing the
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
building from the town
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
this would cover that
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
lease I'll have to check to see if
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
there's any nuances in the law but
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
essentially it says you know that it
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't there's not any exclusions of
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
who you're paying so if a charter school
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
was leasing from the town then I'm under
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
the quick assumption that that would be
 
01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
a perfectly fine lease setup but again
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
I'd have to check the rules all right
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay moving on good
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay so the next uh program that we um
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
operate in my uh the Bureau of school
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
facilities is um the safe grants and
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
um this safe Grant security action for
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
Education safe grants so think of our
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
um our safety grants for schools door
 
01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:51.650 align:start position:0%
um our safety grants for schools door
locks

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
locks
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
um bollards in front of the schools
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
doors windows things like that that is
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
our safe grants some bigger projects
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
under safeguards might be our vestibules
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
those are large expensive projects but
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
for the most part safe brands are
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
schools putting applications in anywhere
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
from ten thousand dollars to twenty
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for an application
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe more
 
01:05:15.299 --> 01:05:16.670 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe more
uh

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
so on that second page your handout
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's the one page summary of the
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
program uh you'll find the laws and the
 
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.770 align:start position:0%
program uh you'll find the laws and the
rules

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
rules
um

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
safe Brands is really a name for
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
funds that we can obtain to pay for
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
secure for secure security projects for
 
01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
secure for secure security projects for
schools

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
it really started out with the public
 
01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund which is
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 19815 Y and Z we can't go
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
any further I'm told Y and Z and we're
 
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.210 align:start position:0%
any further I'm told Y and Z and we're
done

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so the that public school
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund is defined one of
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
them just defines uh what it does and
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the other one defines the members it's a
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward statute and
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the safe Brands essentially try are
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
trying to Target a public and non-public
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
schools for school security Improvement
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
projects the public school
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund is a fund a state
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
fund that's just used for public schools
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
but safe grants is really any funding
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
that we can obtain to give out grants
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
for school security so one of them
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
recently under funding sources you can
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
see uh recently we had General funds
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
through the public school infrastructure
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
fund of 3.9 million dollars and then we
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
were also able to obtain
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
um 10 million dollars of fund funds
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
through the arpa through the Gopher uh
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
through the Gopher office so
 
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that the safe Brands
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
really Encompass State funds and federal
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
when we obtain those federal funds part
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
of that application was that we would go
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
through we would use those I'm sorry I
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
said state but when we obtained those
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds that 10 million dollars of
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
federal funds part of that application
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
was that we would go through the public
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund process in
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
obtaining that and which means that we
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
have a public school infrastructure fund
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
commission that reviews the projects we
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
work closely with Homeland Security who
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
ranks those projects and through that
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
process they then get recommended to the
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
Governor from the governor they then go
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
to Governor Council in fiscal and that's
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.329 align:start position:0%
 
Grant

01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah thank you uh I know some
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
schools don't didn't get any second
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
round money
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for that they don't
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
get what what round if you if you look
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
at the chart
 
01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.029 align:start position:0%
at the chart
uh

01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes well so you notice some most
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
most got first round money
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
then you look at the second round
 
01:08:02.809 --> 01:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
and some didn't get and my town didn't
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
get second round money and I'm wondering
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
why they didn't is it because they
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
didn't apply or what uh no uh well
 
01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.230 align:start position:0%
didn't apply or what uh no uh well
um

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
we can go through that in a second but
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
557 applications that we've received
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
that did not receive funding there was
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
we have an outstanding 21.5 million
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
dollars of uh requests that were unable
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
to be funded so there you know there is
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
a column in there that says whether the
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
school applied or not so if there's a
 
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
number in there but they didn't receive
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
funds then they didn't receive funding
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
because of the ranking process uh but or
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
it could be that they didn't apply if it
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
so under the summary of awards how we
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
tried to keep again safe grants is what
 
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:55.010 align:start position:0%
tried to keep again safe grants is what
we're

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know schools don't always
 
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.890 align:start position:0%
um you know schools don't always
um

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
care where the funding comes from it
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
might have some different requirements
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
along along there but it's for security
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
projects so the first round of funding
 
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
that we released was for using State
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
funds so that first round schools
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
applied just Public Schools were
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
eligible because that came from State
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
funds which is through the public school
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund which is just for
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
public schools and then the second round
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
everybody who didn't receive a grant
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
under the first round was bumped to the
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
second round we opened up the
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
application process again we've received
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
new applications we granted out that 10
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars of federal funds to
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
school districts including public
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
schools and non-public schools and those
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
Awards actually are just getting to
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
schools right now so schools will just
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
be starting you can see amount paid is
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
very little at this point because
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
actually there's a grant agreement
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
notification that is due uh tomorrow so
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
there are some deadlines that are just
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
starting for schools
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and so those numbers will be more
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
robust next time we talk about the safe
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
grants but the money at this point has
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
all been allocated the 3.9 million
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
dollars of State funds and the 10
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars of federal funds with
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
the exception of some um you know it's
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
not we do have a like 40 or 50 000 that
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
the commission is holding off for some
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment requests they kept
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
that buffer instead of breaking into
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
another category of projects
 
01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
another category of projects
um

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
when we talk about school security
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
projects there's usually three types of
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
projects that we talk about we talk
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
about access control we talk about
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
surveillance and we talk about emergency
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
alerting so you can kind of think about
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
in in the security world you know you
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
have access control trying to prevent
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
people to get access to the school you
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
have surveillance surveilling the school
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
for any
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
um with cameras and things like that and
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
then any kind of alerting that you need
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
to do to your uh to the police
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
department so those are kind of the
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
three categories almost all of the
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
security projects fall into one of those
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
buckets uh the first round of funding
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
um they were given to access control
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
surveillance and emergency alerting
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
projects but with that 10 million
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funds part of that
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
application was to through gopher was to
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
focus on access control so if a project
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
didn't rank high enough some of it was
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't the category that
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security kind of rose to the
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and then on the last page or set of
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
pages is just a breakdown by School
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
District the number of applications the
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
total amount that they requested where
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
they received whether they put an
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
application in for round one whether
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
they got funding or not and then same
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
thing for round two and then same thing
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
for whether their project wasn't funded
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
at the very last page
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
you can see the totals on the bottom
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
and again I I guess I just want to point
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
out looking at at the the very last page
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
on the totals we've received um one
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
thousand over a thousand applications
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
requesting over 35 million dollars of
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
projects the grants do cover 100 of the
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
grant so but they did cap it uh they
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
meaning the public school infrastructure
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
fund did cap the projects at a hundred
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per school so
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
um one school requested to build a
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
vestibule that cost over a million
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
dollars if they receive that Grant it
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
would have been just a hundred thousand
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
dollars uh for that Grant
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
and then you can see across the board in
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
the round one 168 schools were awarded
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
almost 3.9 million dollars
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
there is a little column there that just
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
um how much was not uh funded because of
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
that cap and then in round two same
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
thing but what I really want to call
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
your attention to
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
um is the of those 1060 applications 557
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
were not funded it just goes to show
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
that it was a competitive process
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
through this and Homeland Security did
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
work to rank these projects and the
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
total that is kind of left on the table
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
right now unfunded is that 21.5 million
 
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:27.310 align:start position:0%
right now unfunded is that 21.5 million
dollars

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the summary of that program
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'm happy to
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%

okay

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%

video

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.610 align:start position:0%
video
[Laughter]

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
I always see data in finance
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
for special education
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
okay so I um have I gave you two
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
handouts the first one is the
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
information we're going to go through
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
and then the second one is a history of
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
special education Aid how much we've
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
paid out and um what rate we've paid
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
them out at for proration
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
so we have um and I'm going to do a
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
brief overview and then we'll get into
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
discussion of special education Aid as I
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand that's the primary topic
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
today so we um are governed by idea New
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chapter 186 C and then the
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
standards for the education of children
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
So Lisa is the administrator for the
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
office of finance and data management
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
and she provides fiscal management over
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
and her team over our fiscal Ida funds
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and disbursement of our state
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
level funds for special education Aid
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
and court ordered placements she ensures
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
the implementation of policies and
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
procedures for the financial
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirements gathers reviews and
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
analyzes Special Education data for the
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
integrated monitoring activities our
 
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
federal reporting and any programmatic
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
decisions that we make
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
she also completes the annual
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
application for federal funds and then
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
prepares and submits the annual state
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
performance plan annual performance
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
report to the federal government with
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
our 17 indicators so that's just a
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
little of what they do
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
the next slide is just a breakdown of
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
how many students as of October 1st 2022
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
how many students we have in special
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
education and it's broken but down by
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
disability the next slide gives you the
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
key for Disabilities so it tells you
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
their age how many are in each
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
disability for a total of 30 917 kids
 
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.030 align:start position:0%
disability for a total of 30 917 kids
um

01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
I want to say like a percentage of
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
special ed for overall I want to say
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in this yeah so it's it's
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
right around 17 18. I I will say that um
 
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we do get is that
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
our number of special education students
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
has played stayed fairly static for the
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
last 20 years
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
um that's some data that we have online
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
so it's gone up a little down a little
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
but not any higher than about 31 000 and
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
not any lower than about 28 000 so it's
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's been which was that the percentage
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
17 18. it's about 17 18 yep so if you're
 
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:52.580 align:start position:0%
22 yeah
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
yes we are
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
you're right if you're at if you're
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
still at 17 or 18 that means the deity
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
Community is increasing because the
 
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:04.139 align:start position:0%
student population is declining yes
 
01:26:04.139 --> 01:26:06.229 align:start position:0%
student population is declining yes
okay

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
um so at the bottom of page three I've
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
broken down all the funds that we um put
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
through our office of finance and data
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
management we do receive our idea funds
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
um the first pot of money is for grades
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
K through 12 or 5 through 21 that's 53
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
million for Ida preschool and this is
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
targeted at three and four year olds
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's 1.6 million we did receive some ARP
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
funds through the covid relief money and
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
we received 9 million for our K-12 and
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
about 800 000 for our preschool
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
the state funding starts with special
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
education we have about 210 000 there
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
and then special education Aid is it
 
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
about 33 million and our court ordered
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
placement funds are at 2 2 million we
 
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
also have the co-curricular fund that is
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
about 50 million that one just passed
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
now does this include DD uh individuals
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
up till age 21 this includes all yep all
 
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
disabilities inclusive of 21. okay so
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
that it goes all the way up to your 22nd
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
birthday now after legislation that was
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
passed last year okay thank you
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
how much did that cost yeah the the
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
extra year extra year we will know um
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
this summer when we receive all of their
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
submissions for reimbursement one of the
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill that passed last year
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
was that we would pay for any extra
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
funds that the districts incurred
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
because the bill passed after they had
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
already done their budgets so when we
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
received special education Aid
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
applications we will also receive those
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
applications for those students that
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
turned that were 21 turning 22 over the
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
past year so we're not really sure how
 
01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:49.460 align:start position:0%
much we will have
 
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:55.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
um

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
you uh yeah now I lost it I lost my
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
train of thought
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
I'll come back all right we'll Circle
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
back go ahead okay
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
so then if we go to
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
um court ordered placements yep I'm
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
gonna talk about that right now oh good
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be quiet yeah it's on page at
 
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
the top of page four one of our state
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
funds is um for court ordered placements
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and these are provided um to districts
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
for those children in placement for
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
which the Department of Health and Human
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
Services has financial responsibility so
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
if dcyf or DHHS goes through the court
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
system to place a child this fund will
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
assist those districts with paying for
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
some of those funds once the district
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
has reached three times the estimated
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
State average expenditure per child or
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
cap which is right around 60 000 this
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
year all expenses beyond that are
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
covered by this court ordered placement
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
fund so districts will throughout the
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
year they will submit invoices to us to
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
say we've reached cap now and showed
 
01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
that they've reached cap and then asked
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
for us to pay the remaining portions of
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
that the whatever they need for an out
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
of District placement or services or
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
whatever goes beyond that sixty thousand
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
um I did write this year's cap is and I
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
did not put it on there but it is right
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
around 60 000. and then
 
01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
um I also wrote last year we paid out so
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's not actually paid out a little over
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
three million over three million just
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
over three million and that's on the
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
page where I listed out all the
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
um funds that we have
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
the three million well that's what was
 
01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
budgeted yeah to what was budgeted was
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
two million and then we added one and
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
then we added more money
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
my question is with regard to
 
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:44.219 align:start position:0%
the current situation with YDC if in
 
01:29:44.219 --> 01:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
the current situation with YDC if in
fact

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
we don't act and those kids all have to
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
be placed someplace would this fund be
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
the fund that paid for that if they are
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.729 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
when these kids turn 22 now yep all
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
right do you coordinate with DHHS or
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody to help them along
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
just beyond the uh age 22 because they
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
effectively fall off a cliff right so
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
the districts um it's that's done at the
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
district level and the district should
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
be reaching out to their local area
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
agencies and coordinating with them as
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
well as coordinating with VR
 
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
um we have been working collaboratively
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
with VR to develop a system whereby they
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
have more people within schools and
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
assisting and we're trying to support
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
them with that but it is a district
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to that's that transition
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
plan that they should be developing and
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
accessing area resources for that child
 
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
is that part of the IEP
 
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
the transition plan yes is part of the
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
thank you

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
you have you once a district has reached
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
three times the estimated State average
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
how often do how often does it exceed
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
that and is this a do you think this is
 
01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
a reasonable formula for what you're
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with now or do is it very
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
frequently that this that the schools ex
 
01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
so um it's been running about 100
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
students and with the court order funds
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't lap so the court order funds
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
if we don't have enough to pay then we
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
put in uh request to receive more money
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
and so that we continue to pay for the
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
invoices so it's not like spend it's not
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
like um special education Aid where we
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
just have a budget with
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
um with court order there's a law that
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
says that we'll they'll replenish the
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
money so this is a reasonable statement
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:06.110 align:start position:0%
this is not
foreign

01:32:06.110 --> 01:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.729 --> 01:32:09.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
well the question is how many how many
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
kids do we have in court ordered or out
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
of District placements total around the
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
state I mean so court ordered is right
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
around 100 students but that's only the
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
ones that reach cap there may be other
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
students that are court ordered but they
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't reach that sixty thousand dollar
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
cap but we reimbursed for um 100
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
students last year
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
and What's the total for the uh Auto
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
districts out of District I would have
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
to look that number up for you okay
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
no he means in general out of District
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
but you're you're mean over the entire
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
population of special education how many
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
of them are out of District okay
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
okay because all of the court ordered
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
placements were out of District okay
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
so then the next one we have is the
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
special education Aid fund um this one
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
is provided to districts for children
 
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
whose services are con considered high
 
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:04.910 align:start position:0%
whose services are con considered high
cost

01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the state reimburses districts at 80
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
percent for any costs that are 3.5 times
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
the estimated cost per pupil
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
so once they get to that sixty thousand
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollars after that we will pay them at
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of what is um what is
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
required after that the state also
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursed versus districts at a hundred
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
percent for any costs over 10 times the
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
cap so if they get to six hundred
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars then we would start to
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
cover at a hundred percent
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
um there is typically not enough funds
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the account and reimbursement is
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
typically prorated which is on that last
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
so on the next page um special education
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
Aid State funds we did a little diagram
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
to show an example of a student that
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
costs 155 000
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
so which we minus the cap so that ninety
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars that's everything
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's above cap that's what gets Pro
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's what gets divided out by the
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
eighty percent so if we had enough funds
 
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
the state would pay eighty percent of
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
the ninety two thousand
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
which we we would end up paying 73 and
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
then the district would be responsible
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the 18
 
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.890 align:start position:0%
for the 18
000.

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
000.
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
the 18 000 the 73 add up to the 92 000
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's above cap and so and then so if
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
we had enough funds that 155 000 student
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
the district would end up paying 82 000
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
and the state would end up paying 73
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
000. this year we did not have enough
 
01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:41.540 align:start position:0%
funds we paid out at 98
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
so instead of 73.6
 
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
000 we paid 72.3 000 for that student
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
and the district ended up having to pay
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
another thousand the difference towards
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
that student so they ended up paying 82
 
01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.689 align:start position:0%
that student so they ended up paying 82
000

01:34:58.689 --> 01:34:58.699 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay sorry a very quick question in a
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
previous slide I've seen the same amount
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
referred to as cap and ecbb are those
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
just two different terms used to look at
 
01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
the same number or are they two
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
different numbers that are close enough
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
to each other that I
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
so court ordered is three times and
 
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
special education Aid is three and a
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
half times right but
 
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
I I understand that difference but again
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh the cap
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
referred on the I'm talking about the
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
page four of your handout in the top
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
part we talk about the cap number that's
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
around 60 then we talk about an ecpp
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
number about 60. are they the same
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
number or are they different in what
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
ways no it's based off the estimated
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil so the estimated cost and
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're just rounding numbers the
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
estimated cost per pupil oh it's not on
 
01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:07.940 align:start position:0%
here is 17 000.
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
gotcha and then the cap is that right
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
and we end up with a 60k because it's
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
3.5 times 17. see that's where I was a
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
bit confused by and you know I'm new so
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it and the other club my
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
original question really was that 98.27
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
I thought you said earlier that in that
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
this is a fund where everything gets
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
paid out and topped off I may again need
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
a clarification it's it's because
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
special education Aid we do have a
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
budget and we can't go over it four or
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
two uh sorry that's all term court order
 
01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
two uh sorry that's all term court order
students

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
um it's because of the way it's written
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the law it we keep we can have more
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
funds added to our budget so the this
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
court ordered are the ones where the
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget is replenished as needed because
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
there is you know the statute says there
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
is no cap we just pay as needed while in
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
the special education Aid we have a
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
budget we try to get it right but then
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
we prorate if we are over it I really
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate clarifications thank you
 
01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:08.699 align:start position:0%
so the next slide just gives you an
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
overview of special education Aid
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
history if you look at the far right
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
column it tells you what percentage we
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
paid out special education Aid and
 
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
paid out special education Aid and
before

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
um 21 and 2020 and 2021 we were
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
prorating almost every year since 2008.
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
um we did do 100 for those two years of
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 but then again this past
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
year we go went back to prorating again
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
and that's also on this other sheet as
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
well a little bit larger than what is on
 
01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.870 align:start position:0%
well a little bit larger than what is on
this

01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of numbers so
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
I think reps
 
01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.610 align:start position:0%
I think reps
question

01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
Pro rating cat Aid makes a big
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
difference too small special ed age
 
01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.050 align:start position:0%
difference too small special ed age
sorry

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
um makes a big difference to little
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:37:58.199 --> 01:37:58.870 align:start position:0%
school districts
um

01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
when our once we pass the budget when
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
our superintendents notified the rate at
 
01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:08.090 align:start position:0%
our superintendents notified the rate at
which

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
or are you able to tell them the rate at
 
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
which they'll get reimbursed so I have
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
to give um the state has to give an
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
estimated cost so in September the
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of September
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
um oh I think it's due October 1st we
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
have an estimated cost and that's before
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're finishing our review process
 
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
we're we're finishing our review process
so

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it gives them a rough estimate of
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
what they'll get reimbursed and if we
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
can reimburse that 100 and we knew in
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
September we were not going to be able
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
to reimburse at 100 all right thank you
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
you have a big job thank you for what
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
you do it's a real big job right so
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
through that process they in July they
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
start to submit their invoices and all
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
of those pieces for special education
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
Aid and we go through all of their
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
documents as compared to the IEP so that
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
in September end of September she has
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
that number to be able to put forward
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and uh let me see
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
2011 we uh we looked at this
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
and we looked at funding at 100 and we
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
predicted it was going to be 90 million
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
dollars which is very close to that
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
number which is
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of interesting uh way
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
back then it was uh you could see the
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
trend but we've but we're reducing in
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
population which
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
you know but you it's not really it's
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
reducing faster than uh what was
 
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
what 2007
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's uh interesting to look
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
um the last page shows you um when we
 
01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
each year what the estimated cost per
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
pupil is or that eccp ecpp and what the
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
three times is and what the ten times
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
were for all of those years just to give
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
you an idea of how that is the last one
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
is just a breakdown of our federal funds
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that I put in if you if you had
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions about it or
 
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
just as an informational piece
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
and as I said on this sheet all of the
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
pieces that are on this are just here
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
and now I was like I can barely read
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
um this is education I guess on a more
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
philosophical level as opposed to your
 
01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
philosophical level as opposed to your
numbers

01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
um we often hear of you know parents
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
will come in to say the school's not
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of my child and it
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
seems like I mean you're going over
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
backwards there's so much money that is
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
put towards an individual child how
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
often do you get that how do you respond
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
to some of that
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
it's so it's difficult to respond to
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
that because of all um decisions are
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
made for that IEP team meeting so it's
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
really down to that granular level of
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
the decision is made based on the child
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the IEP team meeting
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
um we do not have we're not able to say
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
no you can't do that because the team
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
made that decision
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
um we do have the complaints process
 
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
where they can call and they can say I
 
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
need assistance with this I don't think
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
my child is getting what they need but
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
really it is that IEP team meeting that
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
you go to to say yes this is what the
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
needs are this is what we think should
 
01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.649 align:start position:0%
needs are this is what we think should
happen

01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
um we do monitor districts through
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
another office within our Bureau and
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
they get down we get as granular as we
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
can and we do as much as we can with our
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
authority to say you're not you're not
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
providing these these Services the way
 
01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
you should be providing them or you're
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
not providing reports to parents to show
 
01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
their progress so those are the pieces
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
that we we try to do on the back end but
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
really you can't make you can't change
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
an IEP team's decision about what
 
01:41:35.219 --> 01:41:36.169 align:start position:0%
an IEP team's decision about what
happens

01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
um because it is that's the authority
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
that idea has given them can you tell
 
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
the parent yeah we are
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
many times districts do do that but it's
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
like I said it's at that District level
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
that you know District or SAU or it's at
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you um how many uh
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
kids come off about a special ed
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
and what would you do to incentivize
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
kids coming off especially because it
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
would seem so you know if they have a
 
01:42:09.719 --> 01:42:10.609 align:start position:0%
would seem so you know if they have a
need

01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
then we Supply that need some kids
 
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
should be coming off
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
I think it would vary District by
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
District how many kids they're keeping
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
on and how many kids they're taking off
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
um if you know you have some districts
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
where their numbers are very low because
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
they're very they have a multi-tiered
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
system of support within their school so
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
that you can be meeting some of those
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
needs without placing them in special
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
education whereas other districts May
 
01:42:38.209 --> 01:42:38.219 align:start position:0%
any child that needs assistance they may
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
be identifying them at a higher rate
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
than another District so it's hard to
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
say how you would get them to um
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
not identify the child it really is
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
based on the progress of the child if
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
the child has met their goals and
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're you know there's no gap between
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
where they should be and where they're
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
where their
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
um Regular education peers are it would
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
be hard hard to uh determine
 
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
I could we I mean we could see how many
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
students are discharged but that
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
discharge from special education is also
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
if they've moved to another District if
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
a parent has refused if they've
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
graduated if they've you know there's a
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
variety of exiting information that that
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
On a related question when I was on the
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
school board in Windham we made a
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
significant significant investment in
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
early intervention in the hope of
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
minimizing the amount of resources that
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
those students will need based on the
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
theory that if you come in early you may
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
be able to do it with more you know with
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
more Effectiveness and it will decrease
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
the amount of resources you need later
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
is this something that you guys are
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
monitoring or do you have thoughts on on
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
whether early investments in early
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
intervention result in a you know
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
reduction of services needed down the
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
road or uh you know because right now I
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
just have anecdotal data I'm looking to
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
see whether you know the state sees
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
something in the data across the state
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
on that so we have a third office within
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
the bureau the office of special
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
programs and what they do is they work
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
with districts around best practices for
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
improving results for students with
 
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
disabilities one of the things that we
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor is
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
Universal Design for Learning for school
 
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
districts or udl and Assisting School
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
Districts and developing that
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
school-wide so that improves improves
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
the overall teaching for students to
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
improve their results to do exactly what
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
you said to you know get them early and
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
assist them early so that you're trying
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
to mitigate that impact of the what they
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
potentially have as a difficulty
 
01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.109 align:start position:0%
potentially have as a difficulty
um

01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
we also um we also do I lost my train of
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
thought no worries so basically just in
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
general terms that seems to you know my
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
experience in Windham relates to your
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
opinion and the best practices best
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
practices in the state right yeah okay
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and the other I I just remembered
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
so the other piece is we've targeted
 
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
reading actually for the young ages we
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
are doing our state systemic Improvement
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
plan targeted at reading starting at the
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
kindergarten level because we feel that
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
it will be helpful for exactly the
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
reason that you've said because research
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
has shown that it's it that that is
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
helpful so thank you
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
um following on the same line some of
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
these issues are lifelong they're not
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
going to go away there's not a cure
 
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.149 align:start position:0%
going to go away there's not a cure
um

01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of how many students
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
are you know have sort of an issue that
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
is dealable in this way and can
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
eventually move off of a special ed
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual program as opposed to how
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
many students will be dealing with these
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's because it's such a varying um I
 
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
mean you saw the number of disabilities
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we have because some of those
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
disabilities vary so much it's hard to
 
01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
disabilities vary so much it's hard to
say

01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
um and we're not at that granular level
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
with the district saying where they are
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
um disability wise and really we're
 
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that they may have this
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
disability for the rest of their life
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
but how did they work with that
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
disability and how that can they become
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
successful with the accommodations and
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
the things that we teach them throughout
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
important

01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:32.830 --> 02:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
hello everyone Mark Manganiello with the
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Office of school
 
02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
of Finance I see a lot of new faces to
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
division two nice to meet you welcome to
 
02:35:20.690 --> 02:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
the division I've been with the
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
department for two years I actually used
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
to be an LBA performance auditor so I
 
02:35:26.570 --> 02:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
was trained by Mike Kane and Mickey
 
02:35:28.370 --> 02:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
landergan and I worked on this Committee
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the before so it's it's always good
 
02:35:32.929 --> 02:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
to be back to division two
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
um like Caitlyn said we're going to be
 
02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
talking about the different adequacy
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
programs so in front of you you have a
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheet for fiscal year 22
 
02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
for charter school so charter school has
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
an adequacy program and inadequacy
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
funding formula there's some
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
similarities with District adequacy but
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're just going to walk through the
 
02:35:52.429 --> 02:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
charter school adequacy formula Tyler's
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to talk about some of the
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
programming pieces and then we're going
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
to talk about District adequacy
 
02:35:56.819 --> 02:35:58.910 align:start position:0%
to talk about District adequacy
so

02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
when you look at the charter school
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula that First Column is
 
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
the charter school the second column is
 
02:36:07.969 --> 02:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
ADM ADM is a fancy way to say students
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's the average daily membership and so
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
we we call it ADM because it's meant to
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
capture a full school year enrollment so
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
if um if a student was there for all 180
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
days of a school year you would say 180m
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
that is one student but if a student was
 
02:36:25.690 --> 02:36:25.700 align:start position:0%
there for 90 days at this Charter School
 
02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
you would do 90 days divided by how many
 
02:36:30.889 --> 02:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
days in the school year 180 you would
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
call that 0.580m so we count a student
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
not just a snapshot count we count their
 
02:36:38.690 --> 02:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
whole school year and we converted into
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
something called an ADM but it's
 
02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
essentially a pupil count for simplistic
 
02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:43.969 align:start position:0%
essentially a pupil count for simplistic
terms

02:36:43.969 --> 02:36:43.979 align:start position:0%
terms
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
so for each ADM in the charter school
 
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
formula and this is also true with the
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
district adequacy formula as well as the
 
02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
EFA formula there's something called
 
02:36:56.270 --> 02:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
base adequacy so for 180m
 
02:36:59.950 --> 02:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
um for fiscal year 22 you get 3
 
02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
786.66 so if your student is attending a
 
02:37:05.809 --> 02:37:05.819 align:start position:0%
charter school for a full year that is
 
02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
your base adequacy amount that you're
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're essentially guaranteed if you
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
attend the full year
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
we look at that student and we look at
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional demographic information about
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
that student so that those components
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
are called differential Aid so with that
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
student you've already counted them as
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
180m if they're half an ADM you'd get
 
02:37:24.010 --> 02:37:24.020 align:start position:0%
half of the
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
3786.66 but if we have one student one
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
ADM you're getting your base adequacy
 
02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
aid but we look at other demographic
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
information about that student so if the
 
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
student is eligible for we call it f and
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
R but it's free and reduced price meals
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
essentially what that means is that
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
student is below 185 percent of the
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
federal poverty guideline so if they're
 
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
below 185 percent of the federal poverty
 
02:37:49.929 --> 02:37:49.939 align:start position:0%
guideline we count them as a student
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
basically as our poverty metric as a
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
student experiencing poverty and we also
 
02:37:57.170 --> 02:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
they are eligible for the fnr program
 
02:37:59.929 --> 02:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
the fnr program is overseen by the food
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
and nutrition Bureau within the division
 
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
of learner support that's a separate
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
program the one we talk about fnr
 
02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
program the one we talk about fnr
numbers

02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh free and reduced price meals number
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and adequacy we're not talking about a
 
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
meals program we're just talking about
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
identifying a student that is below 185
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty guideline
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
so a student experiencing poverty so
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's good to think about those as two
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
separate programs but they use the same
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
data sets
 
02:38:25.969 --> 02:38:25.979 align:start position:0%
so if a charter school student is
 
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
identified as being in the fnr eligible
 
02:38:31.130 --> 02:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
for the f r program we also add not only
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy but
 
02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
1893.32 cents this is the fiscal year 22
 
02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:37.969 align:start position:0%
1893.32 cents this is the fiscal year 22
formula

02:38:37.969 --> 02:38:37.979 align:start position:0%
formula
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
um into the formula
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to skip over sped for a
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
second and move on to English language
 
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
learner which is the next column after
 
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
that if the student is an English
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
language learner that's a particular
 
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
program that is federally federally
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
funded federally regulated and state
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
implemented if they're um an English
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
language learner I mean they're learning
 
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
English essentially we add 740 dollars
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
and 87 cents uh to the uh adequacy aid
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
for 180m
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the next one is third grade reader
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is not a lot of students typically
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
but if the student is in third grade
 
02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
they scored below proficient on the
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
third grade reading test and they are
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
not f r eligible nor are they sped uh
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
receiving sped Services nor are they an
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
English language English language
 
02:39:28.090 --> 02:39:28.100 align:start position:0%
learner then we add
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
740.87 to the formula
 
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
um so we're telling these all up
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
um sped as the last one sped is kind of
 
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
unique because the way sped works is the
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
a district of responsibility so where
 
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
the student lives is their home public
 
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
school traditional Public School
 
02:39:48.590 --> 02:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
District they are the district
 
02:39:50.809 --> 02:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
responsibility so sped is a little bit
 
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
different so you just need to think
 
02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
about that when you talk about Charter
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
but just to go back to how sped works if
 
02:39:58.429 --> 02:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
the student is in a charter school they
 
02:40:00.170 --> 02:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
are receiving they have an IEP so
 
02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
they're receiving sped Services we take
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
one ADM and add two thousand and thirty
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
seven dollars and 11 cents to the
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and so what we're doing
 
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
here is we're telling these all up so if
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
we look at the Academy of Science and
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
design charter school which is the first
 
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
one there we'll do 528 times the base
 
02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:20.420 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
3786.66 we get two million dollars there
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
F and R we're doing the same process 22.
 
02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:28.870 align:start position:0%
F and R we're doing the same process 22.
times

02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:40:33.530 --> 02:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
1893 and 32 cents and we get 42 000 sped
 
02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're doing the 12 times the 2037 we're
 
02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
getting 24K English language Learners
 
02:40:41.929 --> 02:40:41.939 align:start position:0%
we're doing five times the 740 we're
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
getting 3704 and then they had no uh
 
02:40:47.090 --> 02:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
third grade readers they might they
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
might just be high school I don't know
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
but um they had no uh third grade below
 
02:40:52.250 --> 02:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
proficient third grade readers that's
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
also not a very common metric used
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
um or a number we have so we're telling
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
this all up and we're getting something
 
02:41:00.410 --> 02:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
called the cost of an adequate education
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
so everything I just explained is also
 
02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
true for district the district formula
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's also true for the EFA formula this
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
is what we call adequacy adequacy has a
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
lot of different names sometimes we call
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
this constitutional adequacy because
 
02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
when we say the cost of an opportunity
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education that's a
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
certain standard the state has the state
 
02:41:22.730 --> 02:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
has determined that these metrics at
 
02:41:25.130 --> 02:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
these price rates is a standard that we
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
must fund our schools so sometimes it's
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
called constitutional adequacy sometimes
 
02:41:31.370 --> 02:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's called just adequacy sometimes it's
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
called the left side of the formula when
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
Mickey talks about a spreadsheet the
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet might have complicated
 
02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
things going on in the right side of the
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
formula but the left side of the formula
 
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
it might just be adequacy so it can get
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
really jargony and difficult to talk
 
02:41:44.929 --> 02:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
about but if you sit down with Mickey
 
02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
and work through a formula and a
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet those are some of the terms
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
you'll go to become familiar with if you
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
do that work and study study these
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets more more deeply
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so we're telling those all up to
 
02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
become the cost of an adequate education
 
02:42:00.050 --> 02:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so when we sum that up for all the
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
charters in fiscal year 22 we get 27
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars so that's base plus
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
differential Aid
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
now Charters had something that's up
 
02:42:09.889 --> 02:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the cost of an adequate
 
02:42:11.330 --> 02:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
education it's called an additional
 
02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
Grant and it's just basically a flat
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
rate per ADM and so it's for uh fiscal
 
02:42:19.270 --> 02:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
year 22 it's
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
3552 and 28 cents and so
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
I I have the charter school formula uh
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
printed out here charter schools have an
 
02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
additional Grant above and beyond the
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education as we talk
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
about District formula you'll notice
 
02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
districts also have additional grants
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
they have different names and we'll
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about those the
 
02:42:40.610 --> 02:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
different District formula when we get
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
there but the charters formula uh Aid
 
02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the cost of an adequate
 
02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
education is called additional Grant
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
districts have their own additional
 
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
grants but they have different names
 
02:42:51.469 --> 02:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
which will make more sense when we do
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
that presentation
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
so telling that all up we get uh 46
 
02:42:58.490 --> 02:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars for 46.7 million dollars
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy formula the only thing
 
02:43:03.469 --> 02:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
that's different with Charters is we
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
send that 46 million dollars we don't
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
send all 46 million dollars to Charter
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
Schools we send them 45 million dollars
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
because the 1.4 million in sped adequacy
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
goes to the district school and so
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
because the district is financially
 
02:43:21.290 --> 02:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for for doing the sped
 
02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:22.190 align:start position:0%
responsible for for doing the sped
Services

02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
um or for paying for this bad Services
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and they work come up with agreements
 
02:43:27.410 --> 02:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
with the charter schools to figure out
 
02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
how that's going to work how the service
 
02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
delivery is going to work and how it's
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to be funded or built
 
02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:33.650 align:start position:0%
going to be funded or built
um

02:43:33.650 --> 02:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the the charter school formula
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
um do we have any questions about the
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
charter school formula
 
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh first of all ADM no is that
 
02:43:50.270 --> 02:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment basically
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's yeah it's so enrollment sometimes
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
in uh and then this is a jargon
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
technical thing sometimes enrollment
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
means snapshot I use it universally but
 
02:43:59.570 --> 02:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you see enrollment it
 
02:44:01.010 --> 02:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
could mean snapshot meaning One Moment
 
02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
In Time another way to talk about it is
 
02:44:05.389 --> 02:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
membership but but yes it's essentially
 
02:44:08.330 --> 02:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
enrollment well now you mentioned half
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
of an ADM how do you come up with that
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay so we we look at a calendar
 
02:44:15.530 --> 02:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
um so if a calendar is 180 days we
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
actually do it to the half day so we do
 
02:44:19.969 --> 02:44:19.979 align:start position:0%
a calendar of 360 half days but just to
 
02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
make it easy we'll just say 180 days
 
02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
because that's a typical school year so
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
we are looking a student sends us
 
02:44:26.929 --> 02:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
information of when the student came
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
into the school so if the first day of
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
school is September 1st we start
 
02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
counting each day and we have their
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
calendar so we know the holidays we know
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
that teacher conference days whatever
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
whatever there's an instructional day
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
that is their calendar they must provide
 
02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
that 180 instructional days there's also
 
02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
it gets complicated there's also hours
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
but just to keep the math easy we'll use
 
02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
180 days some people provide more than
 
02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
180 days but just keep them easy we know
 
02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
if the first day of school is September
 
02:44:55.849 --> 02:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
1st and the last day of school June 15th
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
and in between they they have a bunch of
 
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
holidays whatever it may be we know it
 
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
tallies up to 180 days because we've
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
done the math
 
02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
um we'll track the students attendance
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and if the student
 
02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
leaves the school we'll say okay they
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
left on
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
let's say December 31st and if we if we
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
look at their calendar we know you've
 
02:45:17.929 --> 02:45:17.939 align:start position:0%
been credited 90 days if the math works
 
02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
out that way we know you've been
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
credited 98 days if you have provided
 
02:45:23.809 --> 02:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
you have been responsible for 90 days of
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
instructional days for this student then
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
we do 90 days divided by the full
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
calendar which is 180 which would equal
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
the 0.5 ATM okay one final question if I
 
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
may uh so you're not counting the days
 
02:45:41.450 --> 02:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
that he's absent that's a good question
 
02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:43.070 align:start position:0%
that he's absent that's a good question
representative

02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
um it's all about yeah we don't we don't
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
look at attendance so if the student
 
02:45:49.849 --> 02:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
misses a day goes is sick we're not
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
docking your adequacy it is where the
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
student is enrolled it needs to be a
 
02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:55.010 align:start position:0%
student is enrolled it needs to be a
member

02:45:55.010 --> 02:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
um is the student might show up might
 
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
not show up they might be tardy as long
 
02:46:02.090 --> 02:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
as that district is so just to back up a
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
little bit every child and I don't know
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
the age is a sick basically 6 to 18 is
 
02:46:08.270 --> 02:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance I think every
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
student needs to be in an educational
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
pathway the most popular of those
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
educational Pathways is the district
 
02:46:15.170 --> 02:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
public school system so the student will
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
sign up with their District Public
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
School System saying I am a student in
 
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
this system
 
02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
um uh and so they're they're
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
communicating to the district that they
 
02:46:26.330 --> 02:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
they that they're you know they're in
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
that school system they're going to show
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
up and we will fund them as if they
 
02:46:31.849 --> 02:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
would show it up every day essentially
 
02:46:33.770 --> 02:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
right thank you one final question that
 
02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
just came up uh in my mind here uh
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers some attend just some
 
02:46:43.010 --> 02:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
classes how do you handle that
 
02:46:44.450 --> 02:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
um so if a student tells their District
 
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
that they are homeschooled that means um
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a particular enrollment status
 
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
that we capture in our system they are
 
02:46:56.270 --> 02:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
home educated they are not
 
02:46:59.270 --> 02:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
a student of their District they're not
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to likely get a degree from
 
02:47:01.849 --> 02:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a degree from
 
02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
their District they're going to get a
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
home education program they're going to
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
graduate through the home education
 
02:47:06.359 --> 02:47:07.309 align:start position:0%
graduate through the home education
program

02:47:07.309 --> 02:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I can't go into the details about how
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
that exactly works but they are
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
home educated the district is aware of
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
them they can attend courses because
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
they are taxpayers
 
02:47:18.349 --> 02:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
um basically the way the policy works is
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
they do pay local taxes so they're
 
02:47:23.809 --> 02:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
entitled to extracurricular activities
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
if they want to join the sports team
 
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
they can do that if they want to take a
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
course they can do that the state never
 
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
sorry the state only reimburses for
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
homeschool kids taking courses if
 
02:47:36.290 --> 02:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
there's additional Appropriations in the
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy line item so that is how
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
current law works there's a couple bills
 
02:47:41.809 --> 02:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
in House Ed if they make it through
 
02:47:43.849 --> 02:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
House Ed to the house floor into Finance
 
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
you might see those bills there's bills
 
02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:46.849 align:start position:0%
you might see those bills there's bills
to

02:47:46.849 --> 02:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
waive the conditional requirement that
 
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
we only reimburse districts for
 
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
educating homeschool students on a
 
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
course by force basis if there's
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations so there is
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
bills in the house education to remove
 
02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
that conditional requirement that
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's excess Appropriations
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
um but there yeah we have about the
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent of 36 students that are home
 
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Heath oh I know my
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
question just went out oh I know what I
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to ask you to do would you explain
 
02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
um adequacy is paid out to public school
 
02:48:29.809 --> 02:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
districts differently than adequacy
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
payments are paid out to Public School
 
02:48:33.889 --> 02:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh to public charters
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
is it still the same where they're paid
 
02:48:39.170 --> 02:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
um oh oh yeah
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's a different distribution
 
02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
schedule that's right um just to clarify
 
02:48:43.010 --> 02:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about the distribution
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
schedule um when I say 38 students um
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually 300 students but if we
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
roll up their coursework to be the
 
02:48:50.929 --> 02:48:50.939 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a full-time student and it
 
02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
would equal like 38 full-time students
 
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that but that's right
 
02:48:55.969 --> 02:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
representative Heath uh so the charter
 
02:48:58.910 --> 02:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
distribution schedule is we do a first
 
02:49:01.610 --> 02:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
day count and we pay 30 of what we think
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
the full payment would be so you get a
 
02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
first day count we calculate well we
 
02:49:06.770 --> 02:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
think the full annualized payment will
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
be and we pay 30 in September
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
um then we pay another 30 percent in
 
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:13.429 align:start position:0%
um then we pay another 30 percent in
November

02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
November
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
oh no December now I'm going to mess the
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
schedule up
 
02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and then another 30 percent in March
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
um 30 of what we think the total amount
 
02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
will be and then we do a 10 after the
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
school year is complete we have a full
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
capture of all the charter school data
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
and we pay that last 10 percent and um
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
we have to do that uh with Charters we
 
02:49:36.530 --> 02:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
have to do that 10 correction
 
02:49:38.270 --> 02:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
um pretty quick turnaround because with
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
Charters we're paying them in the same
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
year that the charter student was
 
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
educated we're paying them in that same
 
02:49:45.230 --> 02:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
year so that's different with Charter
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
Schools with district schools we have a
 
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
one-year lack so
 
02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
um whatever the student was in school
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
year 22 whatever the ADM was in 22 we
 
02:49:56.330 --> 02:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
pay you in 23. whatever the ADM is in
 
02:49:59.870 --> 02:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
this year we'll pay you in 24.
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
so there's a one-year lag on District
 
02:50:02.809 --> 02:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
data suite and the distribution schedule
 
02:50:04.490 --> 02:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
is different the distribution for
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy is 20 in September uh 20 to
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
November and then 30 percent
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
um in uh January then 30 percent uh and
 
02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
then approximately 30 whatever the uh if
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
there needs to be any reconciliation but
 
02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to follow up on one of
 
02:50:28.969 --> 02:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
your comments earlier when we were
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the differential Aid
 
02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that I the third grade
 
02:50:36.050 --> 02:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
non-proficient reading score was
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
exclusive from the other differentials
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
so you know if a student had already
 
02:50:43.070 --> 02:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
qualified for federal free and reduced
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
or sped or English Learners then they
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't qualify as a third grade
 
02:50:51.170 --> 02:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
differential that's correct so my
 
02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
question I guess leading back to that is
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
um are the other three differentials
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
also exclusive of 30 no so it's only
 
02:51:01.010 --> 02:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
third grade is exclusive okay thank you
 
02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:05.870 align:start position:0%
third grade is exclusive okay thank you
correct

02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
shout out adequate questions I'll bring
 
02:51:09.469 --> 02:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
towel up he'll talk about uh programming
 
02:51:28.010 --> 02:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
can y'all hear me now
 
02:51:33.650 --> 02:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh it's tal t-a-l Bayer b-a-y-e-r just
 
02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
I believe you all have this handout so I
 
02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take a moment I'm not
 
02:51:44.570 --> 02:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
sure what um some of your sort of
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
familiarity with Charter Schools are so
 
02:51:48.889 --> 02:51:48.899 align:start position:0%
I was gonna do sort of a brief talk
 
02:51:50.809 --> 02:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
about them and then kind of work into
 
02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
more financial related information first
 
02:51:54.769 --> 02:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
off uh charter schools are public
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
tuition free
 
02:51:58.910 --> 02:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
um schools that are authorized by RSA
 
02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:52:03.530 --> 02:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
um that authorization initially occurred
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
in 1995 the first Charter School opened
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
in 2005. as of this year we now have 30
 
02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
charter schools in the state of New
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serving approximately 4 900
 
02:52:14.399 --> 02:52:16.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serving approximately 4 900
students

02:52:16.090 --> 02:52:16.100 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
in brick and mortar charter schools and
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
then there's an additional
 
02:52:24.650 --> 02:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
619 in velax full-time and then there's
 
02:52:26.330 --> 02:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent where they're
 
02:52:28.010 --> 02:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
taking a couple classes here and a
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
couple classes there and if you add all
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
those up there's an approximately
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
additional 1350 students full-time
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
equivalents that are also in vlac
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look at the enrollment
 
02:52:39.779 --> 02:52:40.849 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look at the enrollment
Trends

02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
Trends
 
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
um you can see the graph here to the
 
02:52:45.650 --> 02:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
side but essentially 2010 is the
 
02:52:47.809 --> 02:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
smallest block there's gradual increases
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
from 10 15 to 20.
 
02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
um this year it's about a 14 increase
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
from last year
 
02:52:56.690 --> 02:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
um not surprising considering sort of
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and its impacts on student
 
02:52:58.560 --> 02:52:59.870 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and its impacts on student
education

02:52:59.870 --> 02:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
if we flip the page over
 
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
um this is just kind of kind of a brief
 
02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
synopsis of how these schools break down
 
02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:09.170 align:start position:0%
synopsis of how these schools break down
um

02:53:09.170 --> 02:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:12.110 --> 02:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
there are very few charter schools that
 
02:53:14.809 --> 02:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
are larger typically than about
 
02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
um 200 students a majority of charter
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
schools are in the 100 to 199 or less
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
than 100 student range there are the
 
02:53:25.849 --> 02:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
mega schools there are two schools that
 
02:53:27.410 --> 02:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
are serving between five and six hundred
 
02:53:29.570 --> 02:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
students but again majority of schools
 
02:53:33.410 --> 02:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:35.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:35.330 --> 02:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
flipping into a little more Finance
 
02:53:39.530 --> 02:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
Focus for those that aren't familiar
 
02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
there is What's called the CSP Federal
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
grant it's a grant by the federal
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
government it's the charter school
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
program Grant which essentially helps
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
allows AIDS charter schools and starting
 
02:53:53.870 --> 02:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
up during that critical time when
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
funding resources are not readily
 
02:54:00.769 --> 02:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
available the grant is a 46 million
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant
 
02:54:04.370 --> 02:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
um currently and I'll give you a kind of
 
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of it but of that 46
 
02:54:09.050 --> 02:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
million dollar Grant 90 go to sub
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
grantees sub-grantees are prospective
 
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools seven percent would then
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
go to technical assistance and support
 
02:54:19.010 --> 02:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
for these schools excuse me
 
02:54:21.230 --> 02:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining three percent is
 
02:54:23.150 --> 02:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
for Administration staff to kind of
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
oversee monitor
 
02:54:26.210 --> 02:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
um both the Grant and support the
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools if you were to look at
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
this grant to date over 17 million has
 
02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
been obligated out to sub-grantees
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
um we have roughly a million in uh
 
02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
technical assistance contracts approved
 
02:54:42.889 --> 02:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
by GNC and these contracts are for
 
02:54:46.490 --> 02:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
things for PD support of the charter
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
school community and then the
 
02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
administrative costs right now we're
 
02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
running at about 3.8 percent over the
 
02:54:55.610 --> 02:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
remaining life of the grant that will
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
drop down below the three percent it's
 
02:55:00.410 --> 02:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
just as we initially started there was a
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
lot more sort of administrative startup
 
02:55:06.170 --> 02:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
to get the the grant established but
 
02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
it'll even out below that three percent
 
02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:09.650 align:start position:0%
it'll even out below that three percent
mark

02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
mark
 
02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:10.490 align:start position:0%
mark
um

02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:12.370 --> 02:55:12.380 align:start position:0%
subgrant overview
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
grants are awarded to some grantees
 
02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
through a competitive process to date
 
02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
we've held two Grant competitions we're
 
02:55:21.889 --> 02:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
actually in the middle of our third as
 
02:55:25.370 --> 02:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
we speak which um we will be closing out
 
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
that competition in early March
 
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
um of the sub Awards as mentioned 17
 
02:55:33.769 --> 02:55:33.779 align:start position:0%
million have been doled out 11 went to
 
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
New charter schools and then five went
 
02:55:39.710 --> 02:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
to existing schools what can this money
 
02:55:42.769 --> 02:55:42.779 align:start position:0%
be used for essentially you have two
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
phases in a charter school with opening
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have what's called
 
02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:47.150 align:start position:0%
you have what's called
um

02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:50.450 --> 02:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh startup or planning phase which can
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
last up to 18 months it could be
 
02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
anything uh funding could be used for
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
anything from curriculum design and
 
02:55:59.210 --> 02:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
preparation purchase of materials for
 
02:56:01.450 --> 02:56:01.460 align:start position:0%
the School Technology if you have a
 
02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
design person or a program administrator
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
or director of school who is overseeing
 
02:56:10.969 --> 02:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
the the build out of the school you
 
02:56:12.769 --> 02:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
could be paying their salary through
 
02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
that community outreach marketing
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
website design it's pretty open to a
 
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
very broad array of costs associated
 
02:56:25.969 --> 02:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
with starting the school and then once
 
02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
the school opens it its doors this grant
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
becomes highly restrictive and it moves
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
into what's called implementation phase
 
02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
you can no longer pay salaries you
 
02:56:36.170 --> 02:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
you're essentially limited to things
 
02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:37.010 align:start position:0%
you're essentially limited to things
like

02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:37.610 align:start position:0%
like
um

02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh equipment marketing Outreach
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
training it becomes much more restricted
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
in Focus because the understanding is at
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
this point the schools should be
 
02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:51.230 align:start position:0%
this point the schools should be
um

02:56:51.230 --> 02:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh not self-funded but operational based
 
02:56:57.370 --> 02:56:57.380 align:start position:0%
off of support from from state aid
 
02:57:01.130 --> 02:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
the last page is just a breakdown of
 
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
Mark has done quite a bit of talking
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
about ADM it's individual breakdowns of
 
02:57:09.250 --> 02:57:09.260 align:start position:0%
schools and their average ADM
 
02:57:12.170 --> 02:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
we we mentioned the the four thousand if
 
02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:14.660 align:start position:0%
you look in the far right corner the
 
02:57:17.330 --> 02:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
4900 students in charter schools that
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's the total of all these schools up
 
02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:21.050 align:start position:0%
that's the total of all these schools up
above

02:57:21.050 --> 02:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
above
 
02:57:22.849 --> 02:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so happy to answer any questions you
 
02:57:26.090 --> 02:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.130 --> 02:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
since we don't have the color can you
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
confirm on the page before 69 is startup
 
02:57:34.730 --> 02:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
25 expansion six replication absolutely
 
02:57:37.969 --> 02:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
yes um so the smallest slice would be
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
replication the largest is startup with
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
25 for the expansion
 
02:57:45.530 --> 02:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and just to provide a little bit of
 
02:57:47.769 --> 02:57:47.779 align:start position:0%
context for that with the the
 
02:57:51.370 --> 02:57:51.380 align:start position:0%
replications it is always a challenge uh
 
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
encouraging getting Charters to
 
02:57:56.450 --> 02:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
replicate because they're so con sort of
 
02:57:59.210 --> 02:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
consumed with their own existence
 
02:58:00.889 --> 02:58:00.899 align:start position:0%
um and that is actually one of our our
 
02:58:02.030 --> 02:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
challenges right now in terms of
 
02:58:04.309 --> 02:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
pipeline building is getting high
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:11.090 --> 02:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
okay just didn't think Mr chair just a
 
02:58:13.450 --> 02:58:13.460 align:start position:0%
quick clarification question on page two
 
02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
I wondered whether it's the table or the
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
graph that has the accurate numbers
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
because there are two discrepancies
 
02:58:23.090 --> 02:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
between the numbers listed on the left
 
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the bars on the right
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
generally I assume it's the table that's
 
02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.490 align:start position:0%
generally I assume it's the table that's
correct

02:58:28.490 --> 02:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:58:31.250 --> 02:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know it says that you know the graph
 
02:58:33.889 --> 02:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
says that five schools are in the 200 to
 
02:58:36.889 --> 02:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
299 while the table says four and there
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
is no school in the 400 499 on the table
 
02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
but there is one in sorry there is one
 
02:58:44.269 --> 02:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the table and none in the graph I
 
02:58:45.889 --> 02:58:45.899 align:start position:0%
need to check that I didn't catch that
 
02:58:47.570 --> 02:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
error if you could just clarify which
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
are the accurate ones you know it's not
 
02:58:52.130 --> 02:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
a huge deal but every little detail May
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
matter it's an important deal so I'd
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
like to get that information corrected
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:00.290 --> 02:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
I've got a question on this 46 million
 
02:59:02.450 --> 02:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
dollars is that
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
every year or one-time Grant or
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
so it it the total Grant is 46 million
 
02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:10.190 align:start position:0%
so it it the total Grant is 46 million
dollars

02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:59:12.889 --> 02:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
um and it's over the life of the the
 
02:59:18.650 --> 02:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
grant so I I it officially would end uh
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
next year uh and then we would get no
 
02:59:23.450 --> 02:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
cost extensions to kind of oversee the
 
02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
the grantees through their their
 
02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
expensive funds but it's not 46 each
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
year it's a 46 million dollars total as
 
02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
long as it lasts or until it expires
 
02:59:35.330 --> 02:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah how much do you have left
 
02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh well to again obligated to date has
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
been what did that number I gave you was
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
17 million
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so we're not really too worried about
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
you're not running out of money right
 
02:59:50.090 --> 02:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
yeah okay one of the the challenges
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're facing so if you don't know the
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
history of the Grant had been delayed
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
for a little while when it finally got
 
02:59:57.950 --> 02:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
implemented it's been a a bit of
 
02:59:59.929 --> 02:59:59.939 align:start position:0%
catch-up trying to expend funds and then
 
02:59:59.939 --> 03:00:01.370 align:start position:0%
catch-up trying to expend funds and then
additionally

03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:02.710 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

03:00:02.710 --> 03:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:05.690 --> 03:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
encouraging schools to spend and utilize
 
03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
the money so it uh I think it it is
 
03:00:11.929 --> 03:00:11.939 align:start position:0%
certainly uh sped up as we've uh
 
03:00:13.550 --> 03:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
implemented the program
 
03:00:15.170 --> 03:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
um but when we first started it took
 
03:00:16.849 --> 03:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
almost six months to get folks to start
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
using money and I think a lot of that
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
was more connected with
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
schools were flush with PPP funds Esser
 
03:00:25.849 --> 03:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
funds a variety of
 
03:00:28.910 --> 03:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
easier access and easier to to document
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
funding sources okay thank you yes
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one of the things
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
when Charters first came into being was
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
that they'd be
 
03:00:42.290 --> 03:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
um coordination with the traditional
 
03:00:45.410 --> 03:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
public school districts in terms of
 
03:00:45.420 --> 03:00:46.570 align:start position:0%
public school districts in terms of
sharing

03:00:46.570 --> 03:00:46.580 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
03:00:51.469 --> 03:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
excellent ideas or model programs like
 
03:00:53.330 --> 03:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
in for instance Manchester we have the
 
03:00:55.250 --> 03:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
wonderful Mills Falls charter school
 
03:00:57.530 --> 03:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's a Montessori school and it's
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely exceptional
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
um always wishing that there be some
 
03:01:06.590 --> 03:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a pathway or maybe incentive for
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
some of the cool things that we've seen
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
in Charters to be learned or brought
 
03:01:14.690 --> 03:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
into our public school system that has
 
03:01:18.110 --> 03:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:20.330 --> 03:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't use the term never come to
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
pass it is taken longer than it should
 
03:01:25.250 --> 03:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you so I I moved here
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
from Washington DC and we kind of ran
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
into a similar problem when we opened
 
03:01:31.130 --> 03:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
the first charter school I worked with
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
it was 99. um it took almost 15 years
 
03:01:38.030 --> 03:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
until the the wall between public and
 
03:01:40.429 --> 03:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
Charter came down a bit it's a lot of
 
03:01:42.769 --> 03:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
trust building partnership building
 
03:01:44.450 --> 03:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
capacity building between schools
 
03:01:46.490 --> 03:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
schools like Mills Falls
 
03:01:49.130 --> 03:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
um reaching beyond their walls and then
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
Public Schools receiving that
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
communication I guess it's happening but
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
it is a slow process and then also
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
finding opportunities for both public
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
and Charters to operate in shared space
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
so for example there's a monthly you
 
03:02:06.230 --> 03:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
know State superintendent calls used to
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
be Charter Schools weren't part of that
 
03:02:09.550 --> 03:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
now they are so that's a shared space
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
that helps create that environment one
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the other things that we're also
 
03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
doing through this grant is one of the
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
objectives is to create that sort of
 
03:02:20.590 --> 03:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
shared Community
 
03:02:24.530 --> 03:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
we are hosting both conferences as well
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
as PD days where we'll be inviting both
 
03:02:29.210 --> 03:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
public and Charters and then within
 
03:02:31.150 --> 03:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
those conferences trying to create some
 
03:02:33.769 --> 03:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
icebreaking activities just to get folks
 
03:02:36.530 --> 03:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
to to connect
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes breed I'm really really happy to
 
03:02:40.370 --> 03:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
03:02:43.730 --> 03:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I have had a couple of concerned
 
03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
parents call me in terms of questioning
 
03:02:49.610 --> 03:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
why that
 
03:02:53.330 --> 03:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
um a charter may be advertising that
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
they are following a certain Christian
 
03:02:59.389 --> 03:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum is that I explained that
 
03:03:03.170 --> 03:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's not possible that that they are
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
public schools so they are not sectarian
 
03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
in nature
 
03:03:07.319 --> 03:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
in nature
absolutely

03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:03:10.969 --> 03:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
um I I'd be curious if if you have names
 
03:03:12.590 --> 03:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
of those schools I'd love to see that
 
03:03:15.290 --> 03:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
because within their Charter we review
 
03:03:17.389 --> 03:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
those at time of Charter approval if
 
03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
there were language in there indicating
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature it would be
 
03:03:24.889 --> 03:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
immediately addressed and if after
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
approval they were doing that I would
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
encourage any parent to bring that to
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.620 --> 03:04:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that's the biggest
 
03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
or enough
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
oh my God that's fine
 
03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:20.030 align:start position:0%
oh my God that's fine
foreign

03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of school funding and this
 
03:04:23.990 --> 03:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
is mostly District school funding that
 
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to be covering here it's a
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
big topic
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
um some people on this committee have
 
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
been studying it for years some people
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
are new to it some people have dabbled
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
um even for veterans it can be a
 
03:04:36.410 --> 03:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
difficult sometimes non-intuitive
 
03:04:38.269 --> 03:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
process to study all the ins and outs
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's complexities to it we're going
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
to try to talk through some of those if
 
03:04:45.530 --> 03:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
you kind of hit a brick wall and you're
 
03:04:46.969 --> 03:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
struggling with something don't be
 
03:04:48.290 --> 03:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
discouraged you can talk to the
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
department you can talk to the LBA and
 
03:04:51.550 --> 03:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
we can help you work through some of the
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
nuances of school funding
 
03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:54.950 align:start position:0%
nuances of school funding
um

03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of information in here
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
some of it's more of a reference some of
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
it I'll be talking through today uh
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
so the first handout is 22 Pages if you
 
03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
go to page two
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
summary of all revenues and expenditures
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
for all district public schools and so I
 
03:05:15.710 --> 03:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
always start a training with this
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
document because really it shows you the
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
size and scope of our district public
 
03:05:22.490 --> 03:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
schools and so there's how much money is
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
spent how much money including local
 
03:05:26.690 --> 03:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
state and federal dollars is spent on
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
District Public Schools the number is uh
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 how much revenue did
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
they get is 3.6 billion so to put that
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
in context uh kind of fun fact is our
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy is 80 billion
 
03:05:38.809 --> 03:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
dollars so District Public Schools
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
represent about four percent of the New
 
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy so that's sort of just
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
interesting to put into context about
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
how the size and scope of of this policy
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
area that is the sort of policy or of
 
03:05:51.889 --> 03:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
education but also shared with um
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
division two
 
03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
um so when we're talking to districts we
 
03:05:57.889 --> 03:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
like to tell districts you should know
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
how you get your money
 
03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so when we look at that 3.5 3.6
 
03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
billion dollar Revenue number right here
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we have percentage breaks down of
 
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
where that money is coming so the
 
03:06:11.450 --> 03:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
largest funder of schools is the local
 
03:06:15.469 --> 03:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
education property tax so that is 2.2
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and it makes about on
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
average 60 percent of the funding mix of
 
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
District Public Schools so that is the
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
the biggest funder of school is local
 
03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
education property taxes
 
03:06:28.250 --> 03:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
I have a couple documents here to talk
 
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
about the Statewide education property
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
tax so just to back up a little bit
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers the typical property
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
taxpayer pays four taxes they pay a
 
03:06:40.370 --> 03:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
municipal tax they pay a county tax so
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the municipal tax is mostly covering
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
fire police power agent you name it uh
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
County taxes covering our County
 
03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:47.809 align:start position:0%
County taxes covering our County
Services

03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
local education property tax that's
 
03:06:52.250 --> 03:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
funding our local schools these are all
 
03:06:54.650 --> 03:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
local taxes then we have a Statewide
 
03:06:56.929 --> 03:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
education property tax that is also
 
03:06:58.610 --> 03:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
funding our Public Schools but it is a
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
state tax and so it can trip people up
 
03:07:02.450 --> 03:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a few documents to go
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
through the difference between a local
 
03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
education and a Statewide education
 
03:07:08.570 --> 03:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
property tax and how how that Statewide
 
03:07:10.969 --> 03:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
education one works and we have a tax
 
03:07:12.650 --> 03:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
cut that's effective this year that I'm
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through
 
03:07:16.490 --> 03:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
so going back to this document
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
um about 60 percent of funding is coming
 
03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
from local education that is the local
 
03:07:21.769 --> 03:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
education property tax it does not
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
include swept the next biggest funding
 
03:07:26.809 --> 03:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
source is adequacy Aid so that makes up
 
03:07:29.450 --> 03:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
on average 27 percent of the funding mix
 
03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
of District Public Schools
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and that is the line item of adequacy
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
that and does include the Statewide
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
education property tax and we'll go and
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
we'll explain that in further detail
 
03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:42.830 align:start position:0%
we'll explain that in further detail
later

03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:07:44.330 --> 03:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
um the only thing other interesting
 
03:07:46.010 --> 03:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to point out is we've had
 
03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of federal money coming into
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
schools so we had three covid stimulus
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
bills they all have acronyms those
 
03:07:54.889 --> 03:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
acronyms have acronyms so we have cares
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
act Carissa
 
03:07:59.570 --> 03:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
ARP the way we talk about them in this
 
03:08:01.550 --> 03:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
in school funding is their the acronyms
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
beneath those are sr1 sr2 sr3 so what
 
03:08:07.849 --> 03:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
you need to know is that about 650
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal funding um
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
due to covid
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
um went to District public schools and
 
03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
as you can see about half of that money
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
or so has already been shown up in their
 
03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 financials so if you look
 
03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
at their funding mix in 2020 Federal
 
03:08:25.730 --> 03:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
funding was 4.8 percent of their funding
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
mix so a very tiny amount now it's up to
 
03:08:31.250 --> 03:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
8.9 percent of their Federal funding mix
 
03:08:33.650 --> 03:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
or their school funding mix so um it's
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
growing in size but relative to local
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
property taxes and relative to State
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
funding it is still a relatively small
 
03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:41.929 align:start position:0%
funding it is still a relatively small
number

03:08:41.929 --> 03:08:41.939 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:08:44.929 --> 03:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
but that is how the federal funding has
 
03:08:47.929 --> 03:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
drawing down the funds the federal funds
 
03:08:52.130 --> 03:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.130 --> 03:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
I knew you'd have something thank you
 
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
yep we have a dashboard I mean I only
 
03:09:07.849 --> 03:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
have uh once the fiscal year is closed I
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
get the financial data from the
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
districts but we do have real-time data
 
03:09:13.550 --> 03:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
from our grants management system but
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so far so good we don't know where
 
03:09:16.849 --> 03:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
they'll well they'll end up when the the
 
03:09:18.769 --> 03:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
money runs out or in the period of
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
performance runs out hopefully they're
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
able to spend it all but yeah there was
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
a slow start which you remember from the
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
beginning there's this little start but
 
03:09:26.929 --> 03:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
they've picked up from now
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
so moving on to uh page three
 
03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
page three is a way to think about uh
 
03:09:35.330 --> 03:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
some of the programs that are funded
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
through the education trust fund a lot
 
03:09:38.210 --> 03:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
of these programs we've talked about
 
03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:39.230 align:start position:0%
of these programs we've talked about
today

03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:09:40.849 --> 03:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
um you you got the top there you have
 
03:09:43.130 --> 03:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
sped Aid so you had the sped Bureau come
 
03:09:45.290 --> 03:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
in and talk about sped Aid that's paid
 
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust fund there's
 
03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
multiple other programs in here I'm not
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to go into detail but I will point
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
out that the largest of the programs is
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
adequacy adequacy makes up about 90 to
 
03:09:59.929 --> 03:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
95 percent
 
03:10:03.170 --> 03:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
of all uh State funding districts
 
03:10:05.090 --> 03:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
receive so adequacy is the largest state
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
funding source although there are lots
 
03:10:09.769 --> 03:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
of programs
 
03:10:14.030 --> 03:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is a pie graph
 
03:10:19.070 --> 03:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund Revenue as
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
recorded in the annual comprehensive
 
03:10:24.410 --> 03:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
financial report for fiscal year 22.
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
so like I said most of the education
 
03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
state aid programs that go to schools
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
come from the education trust fund will
 
03:10:34.969 --> 03:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is a fund that
 
03:10:36.170 --> 03:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
receives a bunch of different Revenue
 
03:10:38.210 --> 03:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
sources so if you look at the table
 
03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
there the the biggest Revenue sources
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
are really business taxes well swept is
 
03:10:45.170 --> 03:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
the biggest but the biggest non-swept
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
source is uh business taxes so 177
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
million in business profits 297 in
 
03:10:52.809 --> 03:10:52.819 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of other taxes there you
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
might notice Lottery has
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
146 million dollars so you've probably
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
you probably when you if you buy a
 
03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
scratch ticket or a lottery ticket it
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
says that goes to the Department of
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
Education to fund education that's what
 
03:11:10.670 --> 03:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um I know lotteries
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
also within this division
 
03:11:13.610 --> 03:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
um The Lottery Commission the way it
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
works is they run their business they
 
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
play they run their games and whatever
 
03:11:19.130 --> 03:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
profit they have over gets transferred
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund and so they
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
bring in 146 million dollars
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
so I get questions from citizens I'm
 
03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure you get it as well
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
um some people go well I thought Lottery
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
was going to pay for all of Education
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
well it pays for 146 million and we're
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
very grateful that they're able to
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
provide that but it does not pay for the
 
03:11:38.929 --> 03:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
full you know 3.6 billion in Revenue
 
03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
that they that they need
 
03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so uh this is just all the different
 
03:11:45.530 --> 03:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
programs that go into the education all
 
03:11:46.610 --> 03:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
the different Revenue sources that go
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund
 
03:11:51.050 --> 03:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
um the biggest one on there is the swept
 
03:11:52.610 --> 03:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
and the swept we're gonna spend a lot of
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
time talking about the swept because it
 
03:11:57.050 --> 03:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
can be a little complicated so the swept
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide education property tax
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
and it taxes all property taxpayers
 
03:12:04.969 --> 03:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
except for utilities if you notice on
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
this table utilities have their own
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
property tax so they're excluded from
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
but the way to think about the swept is
 
03:12:13.969 --> 03:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
the state sets a number and Statute in
 
03:12:16.490 --> 03:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
which it wants to raise so the number in
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
statute or they said it would be a
 
03:12:20.090 --> 03:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
chapter law but the number on staff
 
03:12:24.230 --> 03:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
statute is 363 million dollars so for
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 the state wanted to raise
 
03:12:29.929 --> 03:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars and so then they
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at the full tax base of the swept
 
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
how much property values exist in the
 
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
state and so in fiscal year 22 the total
 
03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
sum of property value was 200 billion
 
03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:40.670 align:start position:0%
sum of property value was 200 billion
dollars

03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
so if you do 363 million over 200
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
billion you get and then you multiply
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
that number by a thousand you get a mill
 
03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
rate a tax rate of 1.83 per thousand so
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was the swept tax rate in fiscal
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
year 22 on an equalized basis we can get
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
into different how taxes actually
 
03:13:02.450 --> 03:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
affects our tax bill can be a little
 
03:13:04.490 --> 03:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
technical but on an equalized basis
 
03:13:08.330 --> 03:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
essentially the tax rate was 1.83.
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 23 there was a one-time
 
03:13:15.769 --> 03:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
swept tax cut so where via chapter law
 
03:13:19.250 --> 03:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and the 2223 budget the law was
 
03:13:22.130 --> 03:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
changed to say the swept will not be 363
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
million it will be 263 million so 100
 
03:13:28.610 --> 03:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
million less and it and we did uh dra
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
when calculating that they did 263
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
million over 213 billion so property
 
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
values had grown and they got a mill
 
03:13:38.809 --> 03:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
rate of a dollar twenty three per
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
thousand so essentially the swept tax
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
cut was approximately because property
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
values went up the tax tax really went
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
down but essentially that tax cut was a
 
03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
50 cents per thousand tax cut that is in
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
effect in this current tax year the tax
 
03:13:56.809 --> 03:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
bill that you're that we're um that
 
03:13:57.769 --> 03:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
you're paying taxes on if you pay
 
03:14:00.349 --> 03:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
property taxes so that is
 
03:14:03.769 --> 03:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
um how the swept tax cut works
 
03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
um but it's more complicated than that
 
03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:06.590 align:start position:0%
um but it's more complicated than that
um

03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:09.290 --> 03:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's um the way swept works is kind of
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
unique in a sense that if I go over to
 
03:14:13.849 --> 03:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
uh well I'll explain it in further
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
detail later I have a lot of handouts on
 
03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
it but swept is fully retained locally
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
so essentially the the tax collector in
 
03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
your community gets the gets the levy
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
that they must raise from the dra so if
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
they have to raise a hundred thousand
 
03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollars they'll make sure that they send
 
03:14:31.910 --> 03:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
out tax bills to raise a hundred
 
03:14:33.889 --> 03:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and swept but they have
 
03:14:34.969 --> 03:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
to raise that money and they have to
 
03:14:36.530 --> 03:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
give it all to their school district
 
03:14:38.450 --> 03:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
they can't keep any of it so they raise
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
that money they give it to their school
 
03:14:42.969 --> 03:14:42.979 align:start position:0%
district and so all of these Financial
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
transactions that are occurring are all
 
03:14:49.250 --> 03:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
recorded um uh they're recorded on the
 
03:14:51.590 --> 03:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
state ledger so a community is
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
collecting taxes and a community sending
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
attacks to their school district but no
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
money actually comes into a stake bank
 
03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
account but when you read their kafer
 
03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
and you read the financial documents and
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
you look at the budget we record that as
 
03:15:07.010 --> 03:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
if the revenue came into the state and
 
03:15:08.929 --> 03:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
we do that because we mandated it via
 
03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
law that the revenue must be raised and
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
then we mandated via law that the
 
03:15:14.150 --> 03:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
revenue must be spent meaning it must go
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
to the school district so we record that
 
03:15:18.769 --> 03:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
363 million as coming into the state
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
even though no literal dollar came into
 
03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
the state we just know it happened
 
03:15:23.220 --> 03:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
the state we just know it happened
um

03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then we record all of it going to
 
03:15:28.130 --> 03:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
the school district as an expenditure so
 
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
when you think about swept it gets a
 
03:15:30.530 --> 03:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
little complicated you have to think
 
03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
about the local ledgers and the state
 
03:15:34.370 --> 03:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
ledgers and I have a few documents to go
 
03:15:36.410 --> 03:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
through that and uh we might have
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions but um I'll go forward and
 
03:15:40.730 --> 03:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
talk about the adequacy formula and talk
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
about how that swept cut interacts with
 
03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula which adds another
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.250 --> 03:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
so on page five this is the adequacy
 
03:15:54.410 --> 03:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
formula so some of it's going to sound
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
familiar to the district formula so this
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
is fiscal year 23. in this formula it
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
changes pretty much every year for the
 
03:16:03.230 --> 03:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
past five years it has changed every
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
year so it's hard to keep track of it
 
03:16:06.969 --> 03:16:06.979 align:start position:0%
some things stay the same
 
03:16:09.650 --> 03:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
but there's always tinkering with it and
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it so
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 and 24 no different so
 
03:16:16.370 --> 03:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
just going through the adequacy formula
 
03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
a similar process we are calculating the
 
03:16:21.530 --> 03:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
average daily membership
 
03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so same process if you're 180 day
 
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
school year you're there for 90 days
 
03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's 0.5 ATM same same calculation
 
03:16:29.690 --> 03:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a little different with
 
03:16:31.969 --> 03:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
Charters and districts but um for for
 
03:16:34.610 --> 03:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
this discussion it's basically an ADM uh
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
is remember looking at enrollment
 
03:16:41.330 --> 03:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
um oh in this formula uh we call it
 
03:16:45.170 --> 03:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
pupil I say pupil count because that's
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
how the lva labeled it once
 
03:16:47.399 --> 03:16:50.090 align:start position:0%
how the lva labeled it once
um

03:16:50.090 --> 03:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.889 --> 03:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
so sorry yeah ADM it's different this is
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
a different uh document it's not it's
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
not spreadsheet with ADM but it's the
 
03:16:58.010 --> 03:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
same process so if you have 180m in a
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
yep sorry about that um so yeah the
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
first line is base adequacy Aid so we're
 
03:17:13.150 --> 03:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
looking at your 180m is
 
03:17:15.769 --> 03:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
3786.66 just like it is for Charter
 
03:17:15.779 --> 03:17:17.389 align:start position:0%
3786.66 just like it is for Charter
Schools

03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and we're going through the same
 
03:17:20.330 --> 03:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
process just like Charter Schools we're
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
also going to look for additional
 
03:17:24.050 --> 03:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
demographic information so just like
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we're gonna look to see
 
03:17:27.530 --> 03:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
if that student is fnr eligible if they
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
are fnr eligible meaning they are 185
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
percent below the federal poverty
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
guideline we are adding 1
 
03:17:36.190 --> 03:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
000 uh uh
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
1893.32 cents
 
03:17:41.809 --> 03:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
if they are receiving sped Services same
 
03:17:44.330 --> 03:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
as Charter Schools uh we add two
 
03:17:45.769 --> 03:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty seven dollars and 11
 
03:17:45.779 --> 03:17:47.090 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty seven dollars and 11
cents

03:17:47.090 --> 03:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
cents
 
03:17:48.650 --> 03:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
um if that student is also an English
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
language learner we are adding 740 and
 
03:17:53.450 --> 03:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
87 cents
 
03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then if the student is a third grade
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
reader um meaning it's the the exclusive
 
03:18:02.210 --> 03:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
exclusive uh metric there if they are in
 
03:18:03.290 --> 03:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
third grade
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
scored below proficient third grade
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
reading test and they're not fnr not
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
sped or not English language learner
 
03:18:10.750 --> 03:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
then we add in
 
03:18:14.450 --> 03:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
740.87 and so just like Charter Schools
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
this is just a funding formula this is
 
03:18:19.550 --> 03:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Aid to districts this is
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
not restricted to the fnr program at a
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
district this is not restricted to the
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
sped program at a district this is not
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
restricted to the English language
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
learner program at a at a district this
 
03:18:30.769 --> 03:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
is just a measurement a way to calculate
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education just
 
03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
like Charters
 
03:18:36.650 --> 03:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
um but after that it starts to get
 
03:18:38.929 --> 03:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
different than Charters so we're telling
 
03:18:40.490 --> 03:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
up all these metrics so if you have a
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
hundred students in your school we would
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
do a hundred times the
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
3786.66 that would get you your base
 
03:18:50.330 --> 03:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid if a hundred of those
 
03:18:53.210 --> 03:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
students were also fnr eligible we would
 
03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
do uh sorry if 50 of those 100 students
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
let's say we're fnr eligible We Do 50
 
03:18:58.979 --> 03:19:00.309 align:start position:0%
let's say we're fnr eligible We Do 50
times

03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
1893 and 32 cents
 
03:19:05.570 --> 03:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
if 20 of them were sped eligible same
 
03:19:08.090 --> 03:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
metric we take the 20 times uh two
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
thousand and thirty seven dollars and 11
 
03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
cents and then if you know same process
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
goes on we're telling up all those
 
03:19:15.230 --> 03:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
students and we're applying those rate
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
amounts and so we're telling that all up
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
to get to the cost of an adequate
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
education for a district public school
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
which is the same process for a charter
 
03:19:26.090 --> 03:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
school so over here we have we tally all
 
03:19:27.170 --> 03:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
those up
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we get to the cost of an adequate
 
03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:29.630 align:start position:0%
and we get to the cost of an adequate
education

03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:19:31.969 --> 03:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
so if we tally up all those metrics and
 
03:19:33.530 --> 03:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education is a
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars we know constitutionally
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
speaking we have to make sure because
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
the state has defined this as the
 
03:19:41.630 --> 03:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Constitutional adequate education we
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
need to make sure your district has a
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars so instead of we don't
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
just cut a check right away for a
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars we check to see how much
 
03:19:50.929 --> 03:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
money did you raise through the
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax so if
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
you raised a million dollars through the
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax
 
03:20:00.290 --> 03:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
we'd give you a check for zero dollars
 
03:20:02.690 --> 03:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
um if you raised five hundred thousand
 
03:20:04.610 --> 03:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
dollars uh through the Statewide
 
03:20:06.530 --> 03:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
education property tax but your
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy we needed to
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
fund you at a million dollars you have a
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
benchmark that you must receive a
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars but your swept is only
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
500 000 so now the state is going to cut
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
you a check for five hundred thousand
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
dollars so you're up here so you have at
 
03:20:23.210 --> 03:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
least a million dollars five hundred
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars from the state five
 
03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars from the state
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
but through the swept
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
um it's actually collected through your
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
local tax collector but we call it as it
 
03:20:33.530 --> 03:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
is a state tax and we call it a state
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
Grant and we we have them recorded on
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
their financials as such although uh it
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
basically never came into the state um
 
03:20:43.010 --> 03:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
so it's it's sometimes uh it can get
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
kind of humorous because the districts
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
go thanks thanks for giving my money
 
03:20:49.370 --> 03:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
um so that is State policy
 
03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so that is how most districts about
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
um most districts it follows uh about 95
 
03:21:01.370 --> 03:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
percent of districts their cost of an
 
03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
adequate education is uh greater than
 
03:21:06.769 --> 03:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
what they race through their swept and
 
03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
so therefore we must cut them a check
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
but there are some districts or some
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh adequacies calculate
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
the municipal level there's some
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities where their swept could
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
be two million dollars and their cost of
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
inadequate education is a million
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
dollars and so some people call these
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
donor towns there's no such thing as
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
donor towns under current law there was
 
03:21:31.610 --> 03:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
a process a year ago where if your cost
 
03:21:33.230 --> 03:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education was a million
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
dollars and your swept was two million
 
03:21:37.490 --> 03:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
dollars the state would say you only
 
03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
needed a million dollars now take two
 
03:21:42.170 --> 03:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
million take that one million and keep
 
03:21:43.849 --> 03:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
it and take the other million and send
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
it to the state and that would go into
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the state
 
03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the state
could

03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
do what it wanted with that money and so
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
those communities said that was a
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
donation to the state and we are donor
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
towns that's not that's not the policy
 
03:21:56.750 --> 03:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the state and hasn't been the policy
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the state for 10 years so now
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
currently if you have a cost of an
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education of a million dollars
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
your swept is two million dollars
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
you just keep your swept of two million
 
03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
dollars nothing goes to the state
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
um this web never goes to the state so
 
03:22:11.389 --> 03:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
it would go from your tax collector to
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
your school district and they would have
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um uh above and beyond the
 
03:22:16.490 --> 03:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
Constitutional adequate education they
 
03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
would have something we call excess
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
swept but if you hear donor towns there
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
might be a bill to introduce donor towns
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
um but under current law there is no
 
03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
such thing as donor towns and when we're
 
03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
talking about donor towns that's what
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is excess swept
 
03:22:32.570 --> 03:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:22:35.210 --> 03:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
um moving forward like we talked about
 
03:22:38.450 --> 03:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
that Community which is most communities
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education is a
 
03:22:42.530 --> 03:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
million swept is 500 000. we have to cut
 
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
you a check for 500 000 that's most
 
03:22:46.849 --> 03:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
communities they need a check cut from
 
03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state to fully fund them
 
03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
um there's additional grants after above
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
and beyond the cost of inadequate
 
03:22:55.370 --> 03:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
education so one of those grants is
 
03:22:58.610 --> 03:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
relief Aid relief Aid is what we do is
 
03:23:00.410 --> 03:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
we look at your fnr your poverty
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
accounts for each community and we tally
 
03:23:05.690 --> 03:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
the percent of your community that's f r
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
students and so if you have a fnr
 
03:23:10.190 --> 03:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
percentage in your community above 12
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
percent will give you a hundred and
 
03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars per each f r student
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
um if you're if your community is
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
greater than 40 48 poverty or 40 F and R
 
03:23:25.969 --> 03:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
we give you a grant of 600 for each fnr
 
03:23:27.769 --> 03:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
student and then if you're between 12
 
03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
and between 48 it's a sliding scale so
 
03:23:32.809 --> 03:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
there's no sort of fiscal cliffs it's
 
03:23:32.819 --> 03:23:33.889 align:start position:0%
there's no sort of fiscal cliffs it's
smoothed

03:23:33.889 --> 03:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
smoothed
 
03:23:35.809 --> 03:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
um so you'll get a grant between 150 per
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
F and our student or 600 per F in our
 
03:23:40.610 --> 03:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
student if you're in between
 
03:23:43.070 --> 03:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
very brief clarifying questions uh
 
03:23:45.170 --> 03:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
communities that are under 12 percent
 
03:23:47.450 --> 03:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
get nothing from this particular Grant
 
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.389 --> 03:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
um so the relief aid grant also has a a
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
proration factor so we do that
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
calculation Statewide and whatever the
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
number is we prorate up or down to 17.5
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
million so we could calculate it and it
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
could be 19 million and we'll bring
 
03:24:06.530 --> 03:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
everyone down so that the Statewide
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
total is 17.5 million we could calculate
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
at Statewide it could be 15 million and
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
we'll bring everyone up so that it's up
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
to 17.5 million and there's a bill in
 
03:24:17.809 --> 03:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
the house that might end up over here to
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
change that process and policy so we'll
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
have that conversation
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
um if that bill makes its way over here
 
03:24:24.889 --> 03:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
um that's the relief aid grant so
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
communities with uh fnr percentage above
 
03:24:29.210 --> 03:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
12 are eligible
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um that Grant's been in existence since
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22.
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant is a new Grant
 
03:24:37.729 --> 03:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
added in fiscal year 23 this current
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and the way that Grant works
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
is it's your property value your
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
equalized valuations which is the
 
03:24:47.210 --> 03:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
property value of each Community divided
 
03:24:50.090 --> 03:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
by your fnr accounts so it's property
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
value divided by fnr counts and the way
 
03:24:55.370 --> 03:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
to think about that is this comes up
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
with a metric the metric is EV FRP it's
 
03:25:00.410 --> 03:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's equalized valuation over F and our
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
students so it's this it comes up with
 
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
this metric and the way to think about
 
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
that metric is if you have a lot of
 
03:25:08.090 --> 03:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
property value and not a lot of f r
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
students you're going to get a high
 
03:25:11.210 --> 03:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
number you're going to get a number in
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
the millions because you probably have a
 
03:25:14.269 --> 03:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot of property value and not a lot of f
 
03:25:15.769 --> 03:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
in our students you're going to get a
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
very high number
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
if you have low property value and a lot
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
of f r students you're going to get a
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
very low number so the way this metagram
 
03:25:25.849 --> 03:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
works is first we calculate your
 
03:25:27.769 --> 03:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation over your fnr
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
students to determine if it's basically
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
it shows you if your community has a mix
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
of low property values and high poverty
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
counts in your students it comes up with
 
03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
a metric if that metric is 6 million
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
or greater meaning you have kind of
 
03:25:45.710 --> 03:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
means you kind of have high property
 
03:25:47.809 --> 03:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
values or low F in our students you do
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
not get the grant
 
03:25:52.969 --> 03:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
if it is 1 million or under you get 650
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
dollars for each fnr student
 
03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
and then if it's between 1 million to
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
six million it's a sliding scale Grant
 
03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
so there's no fiscal cliffs you get a
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
grant between zero dollars to six
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars and that Grant
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
started in 23 it also comes with an
 
03:26:10.130 --> 03:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
accountability plan districts have to
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
complete an accountability plan
 
03:26:12.359 --> 03:26:13.010 align:start position:0%
complete an accountability plan
um

03:26:13.010 --> 03:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
in order to receive that Grant and
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's there's a bill in house said
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
um to modify some of those
 
03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
accountability plans uh requirements
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's a new we just went through our
 
03:26:25.550 --> 03:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
first process of doing that so again if
 
03:26:26.929 --> 03:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
that bill comes over here we'll have a
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about accountability plans
 
03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh before I go into the swept hold
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
harmless I'll talk about stabilization
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
grants so some of you might have heard
 
03:26:39.170 --> 03:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
about stabilization grants so in fiscal
 
03:26:43.729 --> 03:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
year 2011 uh or during the um they're
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
into this 2011 session there were
 
03:26:48.050 --> 03:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
changes to the school funding formula
 
03:26:49.250 --> 03:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
this is mostly due to the recession
 
03:26:52.010 --> 03:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
there was a lot going on in 2011 there
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
was a huge but Mike Kane can tell you
 
03:26:56.690 --> 03:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
all about it um the history of it
 
03:26:58.190 --> 03:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
um but there was changes to the school
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
funding formula that resulted in schools
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
districts receiving less money in 2012
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
than they did in 2011. and in order to
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
hold those school districts harmless
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
there was a stabilization grant that
 
03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
went into place and this is 2012 so this
 
03:27:13.729 --> 03:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
is 11 years ago
 
03:27:13.739 --> 03:27:14.450 align:start position:0%
is 11 years ago
um

03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and what they set the stabilization
 
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
Grant was in 2012 if you receive any
 
03:27:21.769 --> 03:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
money in the 2012 Formula that is less
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
than what you received in 2011 we will
 
03:27:25.790 --> 03:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
give you a stabilization Grant to hold
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
you up to at a minimum what you received
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
in 2011. and so when we tallied that
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide and fiscally and back in 2012
 
03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2012 it turned out to be 158
 
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars so that is the
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant that held districts
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
harmless in 2012 to what they received
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
in 2011. so some communities are still
 
03:27:48.650 --> 03:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
receiving that a grant because they were
 
03:27:51.290 --> 03:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
they had to be held harmless in 2012 and
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
so they're still eligible to receive a
 
03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant based on that
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
calculation that was made in 2012. so
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's when we've talked about
 
03:28:00.889 --> 03:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant that's what we're
 
03:28:03.530 --> 03:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
talking about the eligibility is based
 
03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
on if you are eligible back in 2012.
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
um there's also some other details to it
 
03:28:11.330 --> 03:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
but generally that's what it means
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
so that's the stabilization Grant uh
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's some history there and
 
03:28:16.849 --> 03:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about that
 
03:28:16.859 --> 03:28:18.830 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about that
um

03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh okay this stabilization
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
Grant okay if you want this is per pupil
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
no uh the stabilization Grant and that's
 
03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of um some people
 
03:28:31.490 --> 03:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
think stabilization Grant is tied to
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
pupil metrics they're it's tied to some
 
03:28:35.090 --> 03:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
sort of metric the only thing it's tied
 
03:28:37.729 --> 03:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
to is did you or did you not receive a
 
03:28:40.010 --> 03:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant in 2012
 
03:28:42.530 --> 03:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
really because it if if you look at that
 
03:28:44.929 --> 03:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
you know you could lose population let's
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
say a school on another town left your
 
03:28:47.880 --> 03:28:48.889 align:start position:0%
say a school on another town left your
District

03:28:48.889 --> 03:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would you still get the money
 
03:28:53.929 --> 03:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh you if you could have you you could
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
have declining enrollments you could
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
have increased enrollment it's a flat
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a flat number
 
03:29:00.410 --> 03:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
um based on what you received back in
 
03:29:00.420 --> 03:29:04.790 align:start position:0%
um based on what you received back in
2012.

03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
so now talking about the swept hold
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant
 
03:29:11.690 --> 03:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
um the swept hold harmless Grant deals
 
03:29:14.090 --> 03:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
with the swept tax cut so when we talk
 
03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
about that swept tax cut let's go back
 
03:29:17.690 --> 03:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
to the cost of an adequate education and
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
how it interacts with swept so if you're
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
if your cost of an adequate education is
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
a million and your swept is five hundred
 
03:29:25.309 --> 03:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the state has to pay
 
03:29:27.170 --> 03:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
you a check for 500 000 to bring you up
 
03:29:28.610 --> 03:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
to the hole
 
03:29:31.969 --> 03:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
now if we reduce swept so say the swept
 
03:29:33.769 --> 03:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
for this community was 500 000 but if we
 
03:29:35.809 --> 03:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
reduce swept across the board let's say
 
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
by half let's say the swept is 250 000
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
well we still need to pay you a million
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
dollars so you have a constitutionally
 
03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of funding
 
03:29:47.090 --> 03:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
um so now the state instead of cutting
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
your check for 500 000 needs to cut you
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
a check for 750 000. so naturally when
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
you cut swept
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
the swept liability for your taxpayers
 
03:29:58.910 --> 03:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
decreases and the state still needs to
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
fund you a constitutionally adequate
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
education so the state
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
check increases so that's naturally how
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
the tax cut works for a lot of
 
03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
communities about 95 I mean most of the
 
03:30:10.739 --> 03:30:12.229 align:start position:0%
communities about 95 I mean most of the
communities

03:30:12.229 --> 03:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:30:12.239 --> 03:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
communities
um

03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
but there's some communities let's talk
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
about the excess web Community the XX
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
web Community has a million dollar cost
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education and a two
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
million dollar swept now if we cut and
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
they get to keep two million dollars in
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
their swept if we cut their swept let's
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
say by 500 000 so it's 1.5 million
 
03:30:33.769 --> 03:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
then they only keep 1.5 million so that
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
means their school district did have two
 
03:30:38.090 --> 03:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars now they only have 1.5
 
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars so they have two options
 
03:30:42.889 --> 03:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
they can either
 
03:30:44.809 --> 03:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
um raise local property taxes to bring
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
in an extra five hundred thousand
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
dollars they could find another Revenue
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
Source if available
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
um or they could cut their budget
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
because they're to to keep taxes equal
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
they could cut their budget
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
so there's something called the swept
 
03:30:58.130 --> 03:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Grant which brings you up
 
03:30:58.140 --> 03:30:59.450 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Grant which brings you up
to

03:30:59.450 --> 03:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
um for this particular Community cost of
 
03:31:03.050 --> 03:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
an adequate education is a million swept
 
03:31:05.450 --> 03:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
was 2 million now it's down to 1.5
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
million we give them five hundred
 
03:31:09.530 --> 03:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so that their swept is
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
back to what it was to that two million
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
number and that 500 000 check is called
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
the swept hold harmless Grant so that is
 
03:31:18.170 --> 03:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh that is the swept hold harmless Grant
 
03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
it only exists in fiscal year 23 because
 
03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 is the only year in which
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:30.250 --> 03:31:30.260 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
now and this is done before the school
 
03:31:38.210 --> 03:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
districts get their hands on it
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
um in other words when they set the tax
 
03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:41.150 align:start position:0%
um in other words when they set the tax
rate

03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
sort of yes yes and so that or it I'm
 
03:31:46.010 --> 03:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
not going to go into the ins and outs of
 
03:31:48.410 --> 03:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
tax year versus fiscal year but um the
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
way we make them record when they may we
 
03:31:51.769 --> 03:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
make them financially record it we do it
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
all at once but actually the way the
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
cash flows through their taxpayers
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
um there's staggers and delays
 
03:31:59.330 --> 03:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
but that's right they might be getting a
 
03:32:01.490 --> 03:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
check um quicker than they would have
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
normally got it
 
03:32:04.729 --> 03:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
um there might be some cash flow issues
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:32:14.170 --> 03:32:14.180 align:start position:0%
sorry I should wave
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:32:18.290 --> 03:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to go back to the
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant
 
03:32:22.729 --> 03:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
um explainer you just gave us I'm having
 
03:32:25.610 --> 03:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit of trouble understanding
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh the concept and I guess my two
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions are was that stabilization
 
03:32:32.330 --> 03:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
Grant paid over time and is it paid into
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
perpetuity or is this it was a one-time
 
03:32:38.450 --> 03:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
deal back in 2012 and it's not
 
03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
continuing today I guess I'm having a
 
03:32:42.530 --> 03:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
hard time nope it's continuing today
 
03:32:43.969 --> 03:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
um there's a history with stabilization
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's 158 million
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
allocation approximately
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
um if you become an excess swept town
 
03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
you don't get stabilization anymore
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's not actually always 158
 
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
million it fluctuates around 157 million
 
03:33:01.729 --> 03:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
um so that 157 158 million goes out
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
every year now there was uh changes in
 
03:33:06.889 --> 03:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
now I can't I gotta have to look at my
 
03:33:09.889 --> 03:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
other spreadsheet to look at when they
 
03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
went into effect but there was a law uh
 
03:33:14.690 --> 03:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
that was enacted I believe in 2015 to
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
make it phase out by a four percent cut
 
03:33:20.030 --> 03:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
over 25 years so the stabilization would
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
go away after 25 years
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and that law took effect and the
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant got down to I
 
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
believe 88 and then it was fully
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
restored back to a hundred percent so it
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
got back it got down to I'll talk at the
 
03:33:35.570 --> 03:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
other sheet I think maybe 130 million
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the 158 million but now it's back
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
how many districts received that
 
03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this helped my head but
 
03:33:51.650 --> 03:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's uh I think a hundred like no
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
missing municipality now I'm trying to
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
think there's probably a number at the
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of my spreadsheet but I don't
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
have it off the top of my head just how
 
03:33:59.330 --> 03:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
about as a percentage of communities or
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's I think it's
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
I think it's 180 out of 244 towns I
 
03:34:08.090 --> 03:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
think that's might be I think that's
 
03:34:09.650 --> 03:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
what I remember that's why I got voted
 
03:34:15.170 --> 03:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
we might not have the district number
 
03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
but we definitely have the municipal
 
03:34:17.819 --> 03:34:20.510 align:start position:0%
but we definitely have the municipal
number

03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.520 --> 03:34:22.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
I have I have a lot of documents here
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
they're very wordy so I'm probably I'm
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
probably going to skip over it a little
 
03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:29.570 align:start position:0%
probably going to skip over it a little
bit

03:34:29.570 --> 03:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:34:29.580 --> 03:34:30.349 align:start position:0%
bit
um

03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:30.359 --> 03:34:32.090 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:34:32.090 --> 03:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
shoot for two o'clock okay
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
um this is just explaining that you can
 
03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
read up on this this is just explaining
 
03:34:39.650 --> 03:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
in more detail how the swept tax cut
 
03:34:39.660 --> 03:34:40.969 align:start position:0%
in more detail how the swept tax cut
Works

03:34:40.969 --> 03:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
Works
 
03:34:40.979 --> 03:34:42.469 align:start position:0%
Works
um

03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:44.929 --> 03:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
I'll show I'll I think it's I'll just go
 
03:34:46.250 --> 03:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
over this at a high level you can read
 
03:34:48.050 --> 03:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
this document on your own time
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
when you think about swept kind of
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
Representative Buco was laughing a
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
little bit about the the concept of
 
03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
swept and how it's a state money versus
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
local money it's it's it's that's not a
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's not an uncommon opinion um or an
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
uncon uncommon uh uh perspective so
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different ways you can
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
look at a uh us the swept you know you
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
can look at it from the state's
 
03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
perspective in a sense that we set the
 
03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:12.590 align:start position:0%
perspective in a sense that we set the
swept

03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
swept
 
03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
um we tell you we let you keep it that
 
03:35:15.889 --> 03:35:15.899 align:start position:0%
the act of us letting you keep it means
 
03:35:18.050 --> 03:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's really uh you know it's our money
 
03:35:19.729 --> 03:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
we let you keep it
 
03:35:20.690 --> 03:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
um but there's a lot of different
 
03:35:22.190 --> 03:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
perspectives of the swept the local
 
03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:23.690 align:start position:0%
perspectives of the swept the local
taxpayer

03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
03:35:26.090 --> 03:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
um they kind of view it just as part of
 
03:35:27.650 --> 03:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
their total tax rate and they really
 
03:35:28.910 --> 03:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
can't tell the difference between if a
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
swept is a local education money or a
 
03:35:33.410 --> 03:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
state education money and so I've been
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
talking to supers lately
 
03:35:35.279 --> 03:35:35.870 align:start position:0%
talking to supers lately
um

03:35:35.870 --> 03:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
they're working on their fiscal year 24
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
budgets and there's nothing they can do
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
a deliberative session that is going to
 
03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
change the swept so the tax rates the
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
swept tax increase is going to go up in
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24. and so they can
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
communicate to their taxpayers that the
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
swept tax is going up but there's
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
nothing they can do a deliberative
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
session to control the Statewide
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
education property tax they can make
 
03:35:58.490 --> 03:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
moves in deliberative session that could
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
impact the local education tax
 
03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:01.550 align:start position:0%
impact the local education tax
um

03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
but it truly is a state tax in a sense
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
that locally they have no control over
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
it it is set through state law it is set
 
03:36:09.769 --> 03:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
through State policy what the swept is
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to be so there's a lot of
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and and from a
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers perspective they can get
 
03:36:14.399 --> 03:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
taxpayers perspective they can get
frustrated

03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
frustrated
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
um uh of course and uh and school
 
03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
districts can get confused um sometimes
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
the swept money comes in the same way it
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
comes in with their local education tax
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
money and they don't even know the
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
difference but I tell them they have to
 
03:36:29.330 --> 03:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
record them differently and they go okay
 
03:36:31.010 --> 03:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
well you know what what's the number
 
03:36:32.210 --> 03:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
coming in I'm like this is the numbers
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this is you're getting a local Ed
 
03:36:35.330 --> 03:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
money from your school from your
 
03:36:36.410 --> 03:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
municipality you're also getting the
 
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
swept money so it creates some some
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
complexities for sure
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
um and it's basically based on
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
perspective and how you feel about the
 
03:36:44.340 --> 03:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
perspective and how you feel about the
swept

03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
swept
 
03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:46.250 align:start position:0%
swept
um

03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the last thing is just sort of a
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
walk through on how the swept tax cut
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
works from a fiscal no perspective so
 
03:36:54.359 --> 03:36:55.849 align:start position:0%
works from a fiscal no perspective so
um

03:36:55.849 --> 03:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go to the bottom table here
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
just to explain how you would see a
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
swept tax cut in a fiscal note because
 
03:37:02.690 --> 03:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
what the fiscal note is really telling
 
03:37:05.090 --> 03:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
you how the the state money works and
 
03:37:07.610 --> 03:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
how it cost 100 million dollars so if we
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
reduce by The Sweat by 100 million
 
03:37:11.570 --> 03:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
dollars we now have a hundred million
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
dollars less Revenue coming in on our
 
03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
ledgers because we recorded as money
 
03:37:16.849 --> 03:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
coming into our ledgers we also have 100
 
03:37:18.769 --> 03:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars going out on our ledgers
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
because we recorded is going out on our
 
03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
ledgers so that is net neutral to the
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
safe budget when you just cut swept
 
03:37:26.450 --> 03:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
you've lost Revenue you lost an
 
03:37:27.769 --> 03:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
expenditure it's net neutral to the
 
03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
state budget where it actually the swept
 
03:37:32.090 --> 03:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
tax cut costs the state money was how it
 
03:37:34.610 --> 03:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
interacted with the adequacy formula so
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
84 million dollars went to communities
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that were that
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh their cost of an adequate education
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
was greater than their uh was greater
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
than their swept and we had to cut them
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
a check 84 million dollars went out to
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
those communities and about 16 million
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
dollars went out to the communities
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
where their swept was above their cost
 
03:37:53.809 --> 03:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education but the swept
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
dropped and we had to cut them a check
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
to bring them up to the two million
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
dollars that they had before
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
so that is how the state spent two
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
million 100 million dollars on the swept
 
03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
tax cut the way it interacted with the
 
03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:06.590 align:start position:0%
tax cut the way it interacted with the
formula

03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
um so it can get a little tricky and
 
03:38:08.279 --> 03:38:09.590 align:start position:0%
um so it can get a little tricky and
Technical

03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
Technical
 
03:38:12.050 --> 03:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's that's uh that's
 
03:38:14.210 --> 03:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
how this web tax cut works the next page
 
03:38:16.370 --> 03:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
page seven is just a walkthrough of
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
examples on how you can kind of see how
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
the money flows and how it is a tax cut
 
03:38:23.570 --> 03:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
and not actually um it's not decreasing
 
03:38:25.370 --> 03:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
funding for school because the state's
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
paying the difference so for every swept
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
dollar you lost the state paid the
 
03:38:29.929 --> 03:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
difference that holds your school
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
funding level and your property
 
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers your sweat property taxpayers
 
03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
are paying less so that's just
 
03:38:37.610 --> 03:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
mechanically how it works is a tax cut
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
and if you have more questions about
 
03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
that it can be I have some videos on it
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
but it can be kind of complicated
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
so actually your tax is going to go up
 
03:38:48.889 --> 03:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
by about 50 cents this next year it's
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
not that 100 million dollars it's not
 
03:38:54.170 --> 03:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
adjusted that that's um
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
that so when you when you when
 
03:38:58.190 --> 03:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
relatively yes when you but what since
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
property values are going up it's only
 
03:39:00.769 --> 03:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
going to go up a little it's going to go
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
up less than 50 cents because property
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
values are going up so you can raise
 
03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
more money with a smaller tax rate but
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:13.610 --> 03:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I I've thought of this before and I
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean it was an odd thing when we were
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
talking about it last year and
 
03:39:20.690 --> 03:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
it's tempting for me to describe this
 
03:39:23.210 --> 03:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
basically as a sleight of hand in terms
 
03:39:25.610 --> 03:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
of how taxpayers would have perceived
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
this because it was a one-year thing
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
there was no you know 100 million was
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
just instead of from here it was from
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
here but I mean nothing really changed
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
or tell me you know where it did change
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
but to me it just felt like a sleight of
 
03:39:39.769 --> 03:39:39.779 align:start position:0%
hand of moving money around that really
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
didn't do much of anything for anybody
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
so it did change it changed nothing for
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
the school district the school district
 
03:39:48.590 --> 03:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
um the the formula ran as it normally
 
03:39:50.570 --> 03:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
would have essentially if you're
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment whatever it may
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
something could have else could have
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
impacted the formula but it had no
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
impact on school funding the only thing
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
at impact is when bills when tax bills
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
went out this fall this late late you
 
03:40:02.210 --> 03:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
might have got your tax bill um Dr race
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
at the rates in late fall for most
 
03:40:03.359 --> 03:40:04.670 align:start position:0%
at the rates in late fall for most
communities

03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:40:08.450 --> 03:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
um it included a less of a swept Levy
 
03:40:10.250 --> 03:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
than you would have had to pay in the
 
03:40:11.389 --> 03:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
03:40:13.370 --> 03:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
but the state ended up making that
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
since I'm new just to make sure I
 
03:40:21.650 --> 03:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the net impact of
 
03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
that is what was that no expenditure you
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
know was changed the disbursements were
 
03:40:29.330 --> 03:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
the same but they say substituted 100
 
03:40:32.929 --> 03:40:32.939 align:start position:0%
million of State dollars instead of a
 
03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars in property
 
03:40:37.550 --> 03:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
local property taxes so that was you
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
know what this comes down to when you
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
boil down to it yes that's right it's
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's whatever the swept taxpayers were
 
03:40:44.330 --> 03:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
raising that they normally would have
 
03:40:46.130 --> 03:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
sent to the school we said take 100
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars off that and we'll pay
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll pay 100 million dollars thank
 
03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:52.190 align:start position:0%
and we'll pay 100 million dollars thank
you

03:40:52.190 --> 03:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:40:54.650 --> 03:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask the question of what
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
we some of us wanted to do instead of
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
doing the swept rejection put a hundred
 
03:41:06.410 --> 03:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars into the formula to
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
distribute to school districts what
 
03:41:10.969 --> 03:41:10.979 align:start position:0%
difference would that have made
 
03:41:10.979 --> 03:41:12.170 align:start position:0%
difference would that have made
so

03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
the it depends on how you would have
 
03:41:16.610 --> 03:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
distributed it but
 
03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
so with increasing state aid through the
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula
 
03:41:24.889 --> 03:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
it could result in a tax cut assuming
 
03:41:27.769 --> 03:41:27.779 align:start position:0%
districts keep their budget flat
 
03:41:29.570 --> 03:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
um it would there's a lot of into the
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
tax form there's a lot of metrics that
 
03:41:32.809 --> 03:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
go in variables that go into the tax
 
03:41:32.819 --> 03:41:34.190 align:start position:0%
go in variables that go into the tax
formula

03:41:34.190 --> 03:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:41:34.200 --> 03:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
formula
um

03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
the swept tax cut the way to think about
 
03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
it is it was a flat tax cut across the
 
03:41:42.410 --> 03:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
board so every swept taxpayer received a
 
03:41:42.420 --> 03:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
board so every swept taxpayer received a
28

03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
28
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
reduction in their swept liability
 
03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
essentially usually when you're doing
 
03:41:51.410 --> 03:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
changes to the formula it's usually not
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's sometimes it could be
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
across the board but it's usually not
 
03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
across the board so usually if you're
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
modifying the formula you have a
 
03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
particular policy objective you're
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve where you're trying to
 
03:42:03.170 --> 03:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
Target a particular Community like
 
03:42:05.929 --> 03:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
disparity if we at a disparity yeah some
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
of the other modifications of the
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
formula have targeted F and R students
 
03:42:11.450 --> 03:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
have targeted poor property towns have
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
targeted you might want to Target
 
03:42:15.290 --> 03:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
English language Learners whatever if
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
you have a particular formula change
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's probably not going to be flat
 
03:42:20.330 --> 03:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
03:42:23.809 --> 03:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:26.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:29.690 --> 03:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
English language learner and the there's
 
03:42:31.070 --> 03:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
another one
 
03:42:33.889 --> 03:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
can we still can you pay both
 
03:42:37.250 --> 03:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
let's see oh yes uh uh the third grade
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading is the only
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
unique one that you have to um not be
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
any of the other three categories okay
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
right that's still an effect yes thank
 
03:42:45.420 --> 03:42:50.690 align:start position:0%
right that's still an effect yes thank
you

03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna move on to the fiscal year 24
 
03:42:52.620 --> 03:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna move on to the fiscal year 24
formula

03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
oh yep
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
finish the topic since uh this question
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
was asked in a hypothetical situation
 
03:43:03.290 --> 03:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
where that restriction would be removed
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
on the literacy Aid do you have an idea
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
of what the impact would be how many of
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
those students would qualify for that
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
but don't get the funding because they
 
03:43:13.250 --> 03:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
fall in one of the you know previous
 
03:43:15.290 --> 03:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
three you may not have the answer of the
 
03:43:18.410 --> 03:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
Yeah we actually just recently got this
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
2000 I think
 
03:43:32.210 --> 03:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think yeah so the total number of
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
eligible students are about 6 500 before
 
03:43:36.650 --> 03:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
we you know
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the ones that get other kinds
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
of Aid and then we can look at the
 
03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:41.939 align:start position:0%
totals here all I need thank you yeah it
 
03:43:43.190 --> 03:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
would jump from about a two million
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollar part of the formula to maybe like
 
03:43:46.610 --> 03:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars so to remove that
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
it would cost approximately I just doing
 
03:43:50.269 --> 03:43:50.279 align:start position:0%
some rough math probably six million
 
03:43:50.279 --> 03:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
some rough math probably six million
dollars

03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:55.490 --> 03:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 24 the only changes in
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 are the swept hold
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant is gone away because the
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
swept tax has gone away so it's not
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
needed anymore because the swept is back
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
to what it was so if you were getting 2
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
million in your swept like you were
 
03:44:10.849 --> 03:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
before the soap tax cut got uh uh into
 
03:44:13.450 --> 03:44:13.460 align:start position:0%
effect you would receive it again so
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
there's no swept told harmless Grant and
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's also no swept tax cut the only
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
other thing and we'll talk a little bit
 
03:44:22.190 --> 03:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
about this is there's no modification to
 
03:44:24.410 --> 03:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
the fnr data
 
03:44:26.450 --> 03:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 23 there was a
 
03:44:28.490 --> 03:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
modification effort to the f r data to
 
03:44:32.530 --> 03:44:32.540 align:start position:0%
bring it up to fiscal year 20 uh
 
03:44:36.050 --> 03:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
school year 2020 levels essentially yeah
 
03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
which were the pre-prandemic levels and
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think I have
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
I do have a handout further down to talk
 
03:44:44.330 --> 03:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
about the way f r data is trending so
 
03:44:46.250 --> 03:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about the challenges districts
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
have with fnr data
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
unless representative well should we
 
03:44:53.809 --> 03:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
change the way we do that because of
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
things like the pandemic that have a big
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
effect because of people don't sign up
 
03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced which happens a lot
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
it affects it affects the uh adequacy
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
that that's right
 
03:45:09.290 --> 03:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so there's
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the fnr data our poverty data when we
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
had 167 000 students Statewide the fnr
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
numbers were 45
 
03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:17.809 align:start position:0%
numbers were 45
000.

03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
000.
 
03:45:17.819 --> 03:45:18.530 align:start position:0%
000.
um

03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
now uh we have 160 000 students and then
 
03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
in the next year we had 160 000 students
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
and the number dropped to
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
um 38 000. so it's still that's like a
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
12 decrease from the previous year even
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
though enrollment had a four percent
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
decrease and so representative Petri is
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
talking about is our fnr numbers are
 
03:45:40.250 --> 03:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
decreasing at a rate that we know is
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
faster than what they're actually
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
decreasing at and a lot of that has to
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
do with the pandemic waivers that said
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
you don't need to fill out an
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
application to get me access to meals so
 
03:45:51.530 --> 03:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of families didn't fill out the
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
application because there was nothing uh
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
they got the meals whether they fill out
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
the application or not so the fnr
 
03:45:59.090 --> 03:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
numbers we've had a multiple work
 
03:46:01.010 --> 03:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
sessions uh House Education house
 
03:46:03.410 --> 03:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
finances work together to try to study
 
03:46:05.050 --> 03:46:05.060 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:46:08.210 --> 03:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways to tackle it
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
um although the position of the
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
department is
 
03:46:13.969 --> 03:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
we try to work with supers and try to
 
03:46:15.410 --> 03:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
stay on top of them and they know this
 
03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
they know this and it's a challenge as
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
we try to get them to just understand
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
the importance of f r data
 
03:46:22.190 --> 03:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not just the meals program it's
 
03:46:23.690 --> 03:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
also part of the adequacy formula and
 
03:46:25.130 --> 03:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
they get two thousand dollars for every
 
03:46:28.010 --> 03:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
every f r student they can identify
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
so we really hammered home to the
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
districts that this is super important
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they know that and they work all
 
03:46:35.330 --> 03:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
year to bring those numbers up they
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
still struggle it's still a challenge
 
03:46:39.290 --> 03:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
for them to get those fnr numbers up to
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
get those applications in
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
um there is an idea that you'll likely
 
03:46:47.150 --> 03:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
see in this committee um it's been here
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
before is Medicaid direct cert if it
 
03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
goes from house education to the house
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
floor and then into this committee you
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
might see the idea that we can direct
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
certify uh we can identify a student in
 
03:47:04.190 --> 03:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
poverty using Medicaid data that's an
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
issue that might get might end up in
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
this committee uh it's we Norm we we use
 
03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
the DHHS data for TANF and snap
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
um to identify students in poverty and
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
then we have those systems look at NHS
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
data and we identify those students that
 
03:47:23.690 --> 03:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
are on Snap or TANF and we automatically
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
identify them as eligible for free and
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals so they can get fed
 
03:47:29.809 --> 03:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
in their school without filling out an
 
03:47:31.729 --> 03:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
application and we can also include them
 
03:47:34.370 --> 03:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
in the fnr formula for adequacy so we're
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
currently doing that with SNAP and TANF
 
03:47:38.990 --> 03:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and then if you're on fiscal
 
03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
committee you might know that snap has
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
now moved up from 185 percent
 
03:47:45.410 --> 03:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility to 200 eligibility so that's
 
03:47:46.969 --> 03:47:46.979 align:start position:0%
likely going to increase our snap
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
numbers which will in turn increase our
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
F and our numbers through direct
 
03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
certification we don't know how much
 
03:47:56.090 --> 03:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
DHHS has some numbers and then also
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's the Medicaid direct cert uh uh
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
there's legislation I believe in the
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
Senate and and the house
 
03:48:04.729 --> 03:48:04.739 align:start position:0%
that would a lot if that if those bills
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
um that would allow the department to
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
enter a program
 
03:48:11.690 --> 03:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
um that's authorized by the center for
 
03:48:13.490 --> 03:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and also the United States Department
 
03:48:18.410 --> 03:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture which would allow DHHS to
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
share Medicaid data with the Department
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
of Education and then use Medicaid data
 
03:48:26.450 --> 03:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
to identify fnr students in addition to
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
snap and TANF so those are those are
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
some of the policy proposals that have
 
03:48:31.370 --> 03:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
been thrown out there that are being
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
worked on and studied but yeah that's
 
03:48:34.729 --> 03:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
that's been a long-standing issue the f
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
r challenges
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr chair and
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
just to make this even more complicated
 
03:48:43.969 --> 03:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't complicated enough
 
03:48:43.979 --> 03:48:44.570 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't complicated enough
um

03:48:44.570 --> 03:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we have a certain
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
poverty level that we need to meet in
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for fnr and then we are
 
03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
using the snap and tanifest proxies for
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
that to help us identify gaps in the
 
03:48:58.729 --> 03:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
data but now that the eligibility level
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
of snap is changing
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
if we are still using snap does that
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
affect our original decision to use the
 
03:49:08.809 --> 03:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
snap as a proxy for fnr when now people
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
had that you know do you see what I'm
 
03:49:11.210 --> 03:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
saying there are two different
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
qualifying criteria and we may end up
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
counting I'm just trying to understand
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
again because there is a lot of detail
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
here yeah so
 
03:49:21.769 --> 03:49:21.779 align:start position:0%
um that decision
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think if it could be made
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the state level uh the state made the
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
decision through via the fiscal
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee to raise it to 200
 
03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:29.809 align:start position:0%
committee to raise it to 200
um

03:49:29.809 --> 03:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
that 185 number is a federal number
 
03:49:35.809 --> 03:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
um so states can always kind of go above
 
03:49:37.729 --> 03:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
and beyond the federal number
 
03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
um but yeah that's it yeah it can get a
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
little complicated I guess I know I have
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know when those decisions are
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
made or what was understood or the
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
intent of when those decisions were made
 
03:49:50.929 --> 03:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
but certainly there are different ways
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
to look at the data
 
03:49:54.530 --> 03:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate it it's it's honestly
 
03:49:54.540 --> 03:49:55.429 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate it it's it's honestly
it's

03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
very complicated and one needs to wrap
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
their head around it and there is a lot
 
03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
of there are a lot of moving parts that
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:07.610 --> 03:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
I ask a question about direct
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
certification when we worked on that
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
what is what was the status that did it
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
did it not pass or did they did make it
 
03:50:17.570 --> 03:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
over to the house but then it was uh
 
03:50:18.769 --> 03:50:18.779 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know what happens to it
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
when it goes oh sorry made it from the
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
house to the Senate but then the Senate
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
so that's fiscal year 24. if you look at
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
page nine this is adequacy history oh I
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
got 10 minutes left
 
03:50:40.200 --> 03:50:41.630 align:start position:0%
got 10 minutes left
um

03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'll point out to um a lot to look in
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
here and study
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
um on your own time but I'll just point
 
03:50:50.929 --> 03:50:50.939 align:start position:0%
to line 20 line 20 is stabilization so
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
we had some conversations about
 
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
stabilization and when it started to
 
03:50:54.420 --> 03:50:55.610 align:start position:0%
stabilization and when it started to
decline

03:50:55.610 --> 03:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
decline
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
so actually now I can see from here in
 
03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:00.779 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 uh 2017
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
um on page 20 you can see stabilization
 
03:51:05.809 --> 03:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
went from 158 million to 151 million so
 
03:51:08.330 --> 03:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
that was when there was a a sentence set
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
in law four percent reduction each year
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
and so it reduced down in 2018 reduced
 
03:51:16.610 --> 03:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
down in 2019 and then it was brought
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
back up to essentially the full amount
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20. so that's kind of
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
been the the history of stabilization
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
um going to lines 21 to 26.
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of activity on
 
03:51:31.849 --> 03:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
additional AIDS above and beyond the
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education these have
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
been the historical modifications to the
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
formula that have existed in the past
 
03:51:38.819 --> 03:51:39.590 align:start position:0%
formula that have existed in the past
um

03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:41.809 --> 03:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
four years so every year the formulas
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
had a little Tinker with it a little
 
03:51:45.170 --> 03:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
tweakier and there and this is kind of
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
shows you how those adjustments have
 
03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
been made some of them were enrollment
 
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
hold harmlesses some of them were
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
different relief programs some of them
 
03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
were one time some of them were not one
 
03:51:56.340 --> 03:51:57.130 align:start position:0%
were one time some of them were not one
time

03:51:57.130 --> 03:51:57.140 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:51:59.450 --> 03:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
but you'll what I told you for fiscal
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
year 23 and 24 is the current formula
 
03:52:02.399 --> 03:52:10.130 align:start position:0%
year 23 and 24 is the current formula
foreign

03:52:10.130 --> 03:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of phone calls coming
 
03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:13.130 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of phone calls coming
about

03:52:13.130 --> 03:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
um because school districts are seeing a
 
03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:16.550 align:start position:0%
um because school districts are seeing a
decrease

03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and primarily around the fnr because
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
of the hold because of the bill that we
 
03:52:26.150 --> 03:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
pass or whatever it was that we did that
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
said that it would stay constant with
 
03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
what it was in 2019 and now in 2024
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
school districts are seeing not only are
 
03:52:37.370 --> 03:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
they not getting
 
03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:38.210 align:start position:0%
they not getting
um

03:52:38.210 --> 03:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:40.729 --> 03:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
as many free and reduced lunch students
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
they may have a dip in their own
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
enrollments so they're kind of getting a
 
03:52:47.809 --> 03:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
double whammy so how do we what do we do
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
when school districts call us and say
 
03:52:51.469 --> 03:52:51.479 align:start position:0%
how come I'm getting so much less money
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
is is that the response basically so
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that you must be getting them yeah
 
03:52:57.540 --> 03:52:58.729 align:start position:0%
yeah that you must be getting them yeah
um

03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
when and I have a spreadsheet here uh
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which had an fnr
 
03:53:06.050 --> 03:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
modification we paid 970 million
 
03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:07.790 align:start position:0%
modification we paid 970 million
Statewide

03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 24 we're estimating it to
 
03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
be 962 million so they're receiving
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide they're receiving an 8 million
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
dollar drop but also in that we have the
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
CPI adjustment so they might be having
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment and if we didn't do
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
a consumer price index inflation
 
03:53:27.530 --> 03:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
adjustment to their rates they would see
 
03:53:29.210 --> 03:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
a lot less in school funding because of
 
03:53:31.010 --> 03:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments but if anyone's
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
receiving less money in fiscal year 24
 
03:53:36.290 --> 03:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
than they did in 23 it's because of
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
either declining enrollment and it's
 
03:53:41.210 --> 03:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
fnr's kind of the big it's fnr it's
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
either fnr bass because we kept spad in
 
03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
our estimates we kept sped in English
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
language Learners constant but what's
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
confusing a lot of people is that big
 
03:53:52.490 --> 03:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
adequacy check to cut to supplant what
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
they had for swept that is going away
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
and so that's where I've spent a lot of
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
time talking to supers talking to the
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
public explaining that your flat your
 
03:54:02.330 --> 03:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
funding is actually flat but a tax cut
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
was there and goes away and so some
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
people say well you're cutting back
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
funding and I go well no your funding is
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
flat or what's going down a little bit
 
03:54:10.610 --> 03:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
maybe because of enrollment decline but
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
the swept is going up
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
so moving moving on to page 10 um kind
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
of what I've been I've been showing this
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
document to districts to what
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
representative Heath was discussing
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
um this is where districts are getting
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
tripped up with the swept tax cut the
 
03:54:46.010 --> 03:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
swap tax cut is
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
it is hard to explain to people um
 
03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
oh you got it representative yeah what
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
took the place with the swept was that
 
03:54:55.849 --> 03:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
was just Surplus wasn't it
 
03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
um okay I just wanna
 
03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah it was it was because
 
03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
politically we're gonna cut we're going
 
03:55:07.250 --> 03:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
to cut swept tax but we didn't cut it we
 
03:55:10.150 --> 03:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
just took Surplus and made and and and
 
03:55:13.849 --> 03:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
swapped it I can't keep track of exactly
 
03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
what was said on the senate floor when
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
it when the sub tax cut left this
 
03:55:20.210 --> 03:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
committee or left to this chamber
 
03:55:22.490 --> 03:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
um you use 62 million in general funds
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for it so you didn't fund it just
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
off education trust fund you put 62
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the general fund
 
03:55:30.170 --> 03:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund to pay for
 
03:55:30.180 --> 03:55:31.130 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund to pay for
it

03:55:31.130 --> 03:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and then when the Senate looked at
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
the same tax cut they said the revenues
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
what you know the revenues always go up
 
03:55:38.570 --> 03:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
when they go to the Senate you know um
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
they always have more money than you
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
um they said they didn't need the 62
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
million uh they said they could do it
 
03:55:46.490 --> 03:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
just with the education trust fund so
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only thing that I can
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
speak to is they paid for it all out of
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the
 
03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund still ended with a
 
03:55:51.960 --> 03:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
education trust fund still ended with a
surplus

03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
um actually I didn't point out there but
 
03:55:56.210 --> 03:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund Surplus for
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 was 100 million
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that's it yeah well this is this is
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
the actual it's not the estimated but
 
03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:04.550 align:start position:0%
the actual it's not the estimated but
yes

03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:06.410 --> 03:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
um the the surpluses there's there's
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
surpluses in the education trust fund
 
03:56:09.769 --> 03:56:09.779 align:start position:0%
and uh what was that on the senate floor
 
03:56:12.290 --> 03:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
I don't exactly recall thank you thank
 
03:56:12.300 --> 03:56:13.070 align:start position:0%
I don't exactly recall thank you thank
you

03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:56:16.130 --> 03:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
and and so on page 10 is kind of what
 
03:56:18.530 --> 03:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
I've been showing districts to explain
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
the shift in swept to adequacy so State
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
total fiscal year 23 is that 970 million
 
03:56:26.990 --> 03:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then if you look at fiscal year
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
24 it's 962 million so you're kind of
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
sort of flat funded but you'll see there
 
03:56:34.010 --> 03:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
is the adequacy amount that's the state
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
check so it's 707 million in a state
 
03:56:39.290 --> 03:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
check in fiscal year 23 and then only
 
03:56:42.410 --> 03:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
600 million in a state check and fiscal
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
year uh 24 so that's the 100 million
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
dollar swept tax cut essentially plus
 
03:56:49.610 --> 03:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
some declining enrollment so that's
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
that's an easy way to well I don't know
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
if there's an easy way to explain to
 
03:56:53.929 --> 03:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
voters or citizens or taxpayers but
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been using it's the
 
03:56:56.929 --> 03:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
best one the best way to explain it I
 
03:56:56.939 --> 03:56:58.910 align:start position:0%
best one the best way to explain it I
got

03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:56:58.920 --> 03:56:59.929 align:start position:0%
got
um

03:56:59.929 --> 03:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
just to move quickly page 14
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
this shows you total pupils that's
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
really ADM this is by municipality
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
um so when you see there this shows you
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment so most towns are
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
seeing declining enrollments if you've
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
got a number in parentheses you have
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment so this just shows
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
you the ADM Trends so we went from 167
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
000 7 000 students to now we're
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
estimating a 150 eventually 157 000 and
 
03:57:36.170 --> 03:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
school year 22 which is that um
 
03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
um which is the 23 formula
 
03:57:41.090 --> 03:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh I might have my
 
03:57:43.250 --> 03:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh numbers off on that I have to double
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
check that
 
03:57:47.150 --> 03:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so it's a 10 000 enrollment drop
 
03:57:47.160 --> 03:57:50.030 align:start position:0%
um so it's a 10 000 enrollment drop
uh

03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:52.010 --> 03:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
in and then F and R you're seeing the
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
same thing we're seeing a decline in fnr
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
we had 45
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
000 down to 38 000 so uh declining F and
 
03:58:00.650 --> 03:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
R as well
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
um and that's some of the that's somehow
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
so you can see if your town is losing
 
03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.969 --> 03:58:13.979 align:start position:0%
almost yeah General Trends Statewide is
 
03:58:15.650 --> 03:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
decline so a few some communities I
 
03:58:17.929 --> 03:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
think see are seeing some some growth
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
so the last document is kind of
 
03:58:20.040 --> 03:58:20.929 align:start position:0%
so the last document is kind of
technical

03:58:20.929 --> 03:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
technical
 
03:58:20.939 --> 03:58:22.189 align:start position:0%
technical
uh

03:58:22.189 --> 03:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
is kind of technical
 
03:58:26.210 --> 03:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
um if you go to page 19 or this is the
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
second to last document this is a
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
district by District sort of
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know you want to call it a
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
report card or or dashboard
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
um but the First Column is your cost per
 
03:58:41.090 --> 03:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
pupil so cost per pupil is just
 
03:58:42.769 --> 03:58:42.779 align:start position:0%
essentially current expenditures over
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
how many students your District educates
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
so some districts that don't have
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
students have zero cost per pupil
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
because they don't it's meant to be the
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
operations of your schools that's what
 
03:58:54.170 --> 03:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
this measure is is showing Facebook
 
03:58:56.330 --> 03:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
based on the doe 25 the financial
 
03:59:01.490 --> 03:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:01.500 --> 03:59:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:08.809 --> 03:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
so when when districts when districts
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
finish their fiscal when if they finish
 
03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
their fiscal year on September 1st a lot
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
of them don't make it by September 1st
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
some districts do
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
um they have to complete something
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
called the doe 25 which is uh it has a
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
balance sheet a district balance sheet
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it has all revenues and expenditures
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
the district has spent it has
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
information about the trust funds it
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
actually has 2500 pieces of data that we
 
03:59:34.090 --> 03:59:34.100 align:start position:0%
require the districts to give to us
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
is financial data it has some
 
03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental information we can learn a
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
little bit about how much sped cost is
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
in districts
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
we use this document primarily to set
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
taxes we need to know how much money
 
03:59:46.969 --> 03:59:46.979 align:start position:0%
they're going to lapse back to the
 
03:59:46.979 --> 03:59:48.530 align:start position:0%
they're going to lapse back to the
taxpayers

03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
um so we have them record all the
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
revenue expenditures and we know how
 
03:59:53.809 --> 03:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
much if they have a profit essentially a
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
surplus they might keep that and we need
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
to they tell us if they're going to keep
 
03:59:58.969 --> 03:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
some of it if they have the authority to
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
keep some of it or if they're going to
 
04:00:02.210 --> 04:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
send some of it back to the taxpayers so
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's the doe 25 it's used in the tax
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
rate setting process it's also data
 
04:00:09.170 --> 04:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
collection for my office so we have some
 
04:00:11.570 --> 04:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
analytical tools so if you ask for
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
information I can tell you if it's on
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
the doe 25 and if we can analyze it for
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
you we can run reports through our
 
04:00:17.580 --> 04:00:22.610 align:start position:0%
you we can run reports through our
database

04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.429 --> 04:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
right I I have a question yep yeah like
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
our uh warrant for last year showed uh
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
we spent about twenty two thousand
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
dollars per student
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
and this is showing about nine uh what
 
04:00:41.399 --> 04:00:42.290 align:start position:0%
and this is showing about nine uh what
19

04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
19
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
000 and some change why why is there
 
04:00:46.969 --> 04:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
such a disparity or just you can't
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
probably tell that I I yeah I don't know
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
their methodology they could have had a
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
different methodology than us
 
04:00:52.500 --> 04:00:54.530 align:start position:0%
different methodology than us
um

04:00:54.530 --> 04:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:54.540 --> 04:00:57.790 align:start position:0%
um
mm-hmm

04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.410 --> 04:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
so oh oh so what they're using
 
04:01:02.570 --> 04:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
Appropriations over pupils which are
 
04:01:04.490 --> 04:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to be higher likely
 
04:01:05.929 --> 04:01:05.939 align:start position:0%
or what did you say the number was for
 
04:01:08.330 --> 04:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
that 22 000.
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so if they're doing Appropriations
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
they're assuming they're going to spend
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
every penny of that appropriation but
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
usually there's a lapse at the end of
 
04:01:16.490 --> 04:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
the year so that could be that could be
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.720 --> 04:01:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:01:28.490 --> 04:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a little apples and oranges it's
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a they're guessing
 
04:01:31.490 --> 04:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
essentially too when they do a worn
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
article they don't know
 
04:01:35.150 --> 04:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
they don't know
 
04:01:37.010 --> 04:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah they might be local they might be
 
04:01:39.110 --> 04:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
lowballing the grants which is sometimes
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
you want to do that because you want to
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.729 --> 04:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up to the same
 
04:01:48.650 --> 04:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
question I was gonna ask it too because
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh I live in Windham and we've been
 
04:01:53.929 --> 04:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
consistently around or over 18 000 the
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
students and this report shows us at 16.
 
04:01:58.729 --> 04:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
so I guess the easiest way to answer to
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
that could you maybe share the exact
 
04:02:03.050 --> 04:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
methodology used by your department to
 
04:02:05.809 --> 04:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
calculate the cost per pupil and you
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
know that would make it very easy for us
 
04:02:09.170 --> 04:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
to figure out where the differences are
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
at least get us a starting point because
 
04:02:13.130 --> 04:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't want to belabor this
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
right now but it would be useful to
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
understand the apparent discrepancy yes
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a particular methodology
 
04:02:21.710 --> 04:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's on the doe 25 but yes well uh
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's um we back out a few things
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so whether Windows doing that that
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
likely does it yep
 
04:02:31.130 --> 04:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
um just to die this is for your own
 
04:02:32.929 --> 04:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
homework if you want to study how these
 
04:02:34.729 --> 04:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
districts work
 
04:02:36.290 --> 04:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
um we have a local Revenue percentage so
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
how much of their revenue is local by
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
District how much of their revenue is
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
state by District how much the revenue
 
04:02:43.849 --> 04:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
is federal by district and then we have
 
04:02:43.859 --> 04:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
is federal by district and then we have
um

04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:46.130 --> 04:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
um if you want to kind of get into the
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
policy details of this we have an
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
assessed tax rate versus an equalized
 
04:02:52.610 --> 04:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
tax rate and so some of you might get
 
04:02:54.050 --> 04:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
your tax bill and you want to look at
 
04:02:55.250 --> 04:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
your tax rate and you want to look at
 
04:02:57.050 --> 04:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
your neighbor's tax rate and you want to
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
go wise there's less than ours or why is
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
there uh yeah why is there less than
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
ours you know I want a lower tax rate
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
and so that's a if you go to the diy's
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
website that's an alright methodology to
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
compare your tax rate to your neighbors
 
04:03:10.610 --> 04:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
but a better methodology is a document
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
that the department publishes where we
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
look at not
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
whenever dra publishes that tax rates
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's based on the assessed property in
 
04:03:20.330 --> 04:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
your town
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
and your your town might have a distant
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
different assessing process than your
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
neighboring town so if you want to
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
control and say let's just use market
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
value for properties and let's actually
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
try to have the best apple to Apple
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
comparisons you could look at the
 
04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
equalized tax rate so as you'll see
 
04:03:38.570 --> 04:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
Statewide the equalized tax rate median
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
is 17 per thousand where with the
 
04:03:45.050 --> 04:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
assessed tax rate median is 21 per
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
thousand so what that means is
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
districts are assessors are basically
 
04:03:52.849 --> 04:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
Under reporting their property to
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
compare relative to market value so they
 
04:03:56.570 --> 04:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
need a higher tax rate and raise the
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
money they actually need so this is
 
04:03:59.929 --> 04:03:59.939 align:start position:0%
really technical but if you really want
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
to compare your neighbors and how
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're doing on a tax rate by tax rate
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
basis we have a document on our website
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
you can use this document to sort of
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
just get a flavor of where how you stack
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
up to your neighbors because it controls
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
for assessing practices between
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
different towns
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
and so I know we're running out of time
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
here I've got Caitlin here to talk about
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
or maybe just take a five minute well
 
04:04:37.370 --> 04:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
he's he's I believe he's left for the
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
day he has to take care of his uh wife
 
04:04:39.180 --> 04:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
day he has to take care of his uh wife
so

04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:53.929 --> 04:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it would be
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
if I could just speak on behalf of the
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
newbies this was a lot of information to
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
take in today and to open another big
 
04:05:00.300 --> 04:05:01.849 align:start position:0%
take in today and to open another big
topic

04:05:01.849 --> 04:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
topic
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
might be overload so if we don't mind
 
04:05:07.130 --> 04:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
deferring to have the chair come back I
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind doing this another day so
 
04:05:10.610 --> 04:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
I can digest this go back and watch the
 
04:05:11.809 --> 04:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
video a second time and make sure I
 
04:05:13.370 --> 04:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
didn't miss anything
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
very good Don and I believe Caitlyn said
 
04:05:19.250 --> 04:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
she'd come back another day so and
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
and you know and I I speak for the
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee but I think today has been
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
very enlightening there's a lot of
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
information that we didn't have uh and
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh really appreciate you being here
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.130 --> 04:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
very good
 
04:06:21.889 --> 04:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
so is there anything else
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else I tell you this is you know
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
and many of us have been and seen this
 
04:06:29.150 --> 04:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
before and it's it's a lot to take in
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know the detail like the swept the
 
04:06:34.250 --> 04:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
swept was
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's something we haven't had and
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's very hard you know it gets to be
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand but you you get
 
04:06:42.290 --> 04:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
it it's not a it's not a big deal
 
04:06:43.729 --> 04:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
thankfully I have a little bit of
 
04:06:45.530 --> 04:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
insight from the Ways and Means
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
Committee talking about swept but I do
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
think today's
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
very good I guess I guess we're done for
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
the day and we'll see you tomorrow and
 
04:07:33.969 --> 04:07:33.979 align:start position:0%
