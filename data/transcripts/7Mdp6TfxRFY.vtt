lawyers to make sure that they'd gotten
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%

lands preservation committee uh and so
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
that makes eight members rather than uh
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
seven and uh then it would add a member
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire land trust
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%

um and uh then all the appropriate
re-lettering

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
re-lettering
 
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.210 align:start position:0%
re-lettering
um

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
the next section is what was the
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
previous uh the entire previous bill
 
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540 align:start position:0%
which is that uh
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%

enforce the terms of the deed and that
 
00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:34.269 align:start position:0%
enforce the terms of the deed and that
basically

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
means that
 
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
means that
um

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
the uh the department uh can participate

in land preservation with other entities
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
um uh it can either it can either be
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
um from the federal level like uh so
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%

National Conservation Resource Council
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
or uh or USDA or it can be uh with
 
00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:07.630 align:start position:0%
or uh or USDA or it can be uh with
um

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh with uh private organizations like
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
one of the state land trusts
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
um but that it'll basically allows the
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
um that sort of cooperation and it says
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
that there that uh any deed that is made
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
in cooperation with those other bodies
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh the states rights acquired pursuant
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
sold or otherwise conveyed to a third
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
party so that basically means that
 
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.090 align:start position:0%
party so that basically means that
um

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the state has control if it's a
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
if it's a deed that has multiple uh
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
holders on it then uh this basically
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
says that the states rights need to
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
follow this and uh the states and what
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
happens to the states rights it's not
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
binding on say Federal Federal rights or
 
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.449 align:start position:0%
binding on say Federal Federal rights or
on

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:21.290 align:start position:0%
on
um

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
land private land trust rights uh and uh
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
and uh the next paragraph uh basically
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
uh indicates that the
 
00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:39.290 align:start position:0%
uh indicates that the
um

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
the deed uh that that any
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that restricts restriction
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
restrictions can be built into the deed
 
00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:48.650 align:start position:0%
restrictions can be built into the deed
so

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
um agricultural preservation restriction
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
shall be in perpetuity except as
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
released pursuant to this section and as
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
they may be further set forth in the
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
terms of the Deeds so
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
um if there's a if the restrictions are
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
released they are they not only have to
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
meet with the terms of this section but
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
also uh with the terms of the deed and
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh the next uh paragraph is
 
00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:18.410 align:start position:0%
uh the next uh paragraph is
um

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
in makes that separation between the
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
state's interest and other other
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
potential interests so that
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
um this statute basically governs the
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
state interest other interests are
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
um are governed by uh by the deed
 
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.530 align:start position:0%
um are governed by uh by the deed
um

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
and uh paragraphs two and three are
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
basically para they're parallel one
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
dealing with agricultural interest
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
preservation the other is interest in
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
development rights
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and on the fifth section is
 
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.610 align:start position:0%
um and on the fifth section is
um

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:03.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
if they're uh
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's a release of the
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
of the restrictions uh
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
they have any any release of those
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions has to be consistent with
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
the terms of the deed uh
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
um basically what the what the amendment
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
does uh the overall effect of this is to
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
make it possible for the
 
00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.370 align:start position:0%
make it possible for the
um

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:33.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
for the state's land agricultural land
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
preservation program to uh
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
get matching funds from the federal
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
government to preserve more agricultural
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
land uh and that's and that preservation
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
of land is a contract between the
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
current land holder uh landowner and the
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
state and any other uh uh public or
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
private interests that are involved in
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
on in that sale so if there were there
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's conceivable there could be money
 
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:11.660 align:start position:0%
from an ncrs Grant there could be money
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
from the southeast land trust and there
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
could be money from the state from the
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture provided as
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
matching funds for the
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
um for uh for the federal portion and
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
all of those parties would be uh would
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
have an interest in the deed and would
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
be able to enforce the restrictions of
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
it uh so
 
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.069 align:start position:0%
it uh so
um

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
so there's basically this the net effect
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
is it's going to make it more possible
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
for the state to help with land
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
preservation there's there's also
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
currently about a million and a third
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
dollars in uh earmarks at the Department
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture for matching grants to
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
get Federal money uh to help with this
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
Pro with this process and that money
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative kantoy you have a
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
question uh yes um just a couple of
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
comments uh directed towards
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby on this amendment
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind Madam sure go right
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
um represent Bixby on page two
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
um section uh the first section where it
 
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:25.970 align:start position:0%
um section uh the first section where it
says

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
the state's rights Acquired and it says
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
otherwise conveyed to a third party
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
without consent to the landowner
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
now the landowner I'm assuming is the
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
person who allowed
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
the deed to go forth is that correct
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so uh station
 
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100 align:start position:0%
um shall not be sort of
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
is either the person who made the who
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
made that initial deed with the state or
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
if the property would had been was
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
transferred at some later Point than the
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
deed restrictions would be binding on a
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
further odor of the land
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
so just to be sure what you're saying is
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
is that if there is a family and one of
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
the parties enters into this deed they
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
are considered the landowner
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
and if it is their wish to pass on that
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
land to their another member of their
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
family they would then be the landowner
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
in this section is that correct yes
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so there so any any
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership would transfer the
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
all of the restrictions and the deed and
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
the state can't do anything uh without
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and the the state
 
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.770 align:start position:0%
and the the state
um

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh has to consult uh with the landowner
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
whoever the current landowner is before
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up yep thank you
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
um also in here it seems to me that even
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
though preserving agricultural land is
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
important there is a provision in here
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
that it could go to development
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.010 align:start position:0%
is that correct
um

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
this actually reduces the possibility of
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
that uh so the way that the law is
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
currently uh there is a possib the the
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
state has the capacity to if there is a
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
determination that the land is no longer
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
suitable for farming and that
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
determination would be done by the
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee that's referenced on the first
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
page uh then uh it is possible to
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
essentially extinguish the state's
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
rights uh the state's interest in that
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
property under current law what this
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
would do is that in any situation where
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
where the land is owned jointly by say a
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
land trust and uh money used for the
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
through the ncrs or uh then uh the state
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
could say we don't have an interest in
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
it anymore but those other uh those
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
other interests would still have the
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
capacity to require that the deed be
 
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.850 align:start position:0%
capacity to require that the deed be
maintained

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
with the restrictions okay one more one
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
more go ahead thank you so
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the part here it says here
 
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.210 align:start position:0%
um the part here it says here
uh

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
the site is no longer suitable for
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes
 
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.029 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes
um

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I can understand that there would be
 
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
some instances where land would not be
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
suitable for agricultural purposes at
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
one point in time but if it was led to
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
if it was worked and reworked and
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
over the course of some years it would
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
then be suitable again for agricultural
 
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.010 align:start position:0%
then be suitable again for agricultural
purposes

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
purposes
so

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.130 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
because you know at one point we were on
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of Farmland we let it grow
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
up so right now a lot of it's not
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
suitable for farming but if you reclaim
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of that it then becomes suitable
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
for agricultural purposes
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
um how something would be determined
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't suitable when we know
 
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.770 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't suitable when we know
that

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
you can make almost any land suitable
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
for agricultural purposes if you take
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
the time right and and so that that is
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that is that that section about if
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's no longer suitable for agricultural
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
purposes is part of current law it's not
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're not uh and what we're essentially
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're putting more
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
restriction on that uh and uh the uh in
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
terms of who makes that determination uh
 
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
the uh the landowner would uh petition
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
the agricultural lands preservation
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee and that committee would make
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
a determination about uh its suitability
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
but for any and and that is a process
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
that can happen with any agricultural
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
land that is currently under a deed that
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
was created with this program as it
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
stands uh and that that part of it won't
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
change but uh any for any going forward
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that is done uh jointly with another
 
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.770 align:start position:0%
that is done uh jointly with another
um

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
another entity uh the state cannot
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
unilaterally uh say it's not suitable so
 
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:31.820 align:start position:0%
it actually creates better prediction
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
chair um so with respect to lines 25
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
through 27 on page uh two okay when
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh repayment of a
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
landowner owner is there a time
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh frame in which the repayment has to
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
be made and and who is tracking that uh
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
receipt of monies back
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that is something that
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
would that is covered under department
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
rules and the commissioner could
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
probably explain how that would work but
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.370 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Creighton

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
I guess ma'am
 
00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:20.690 align:start position:0%
I guess ma'am
um

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
and this is for uh representative Bixby
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
so just to to backtrack
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and make sure I got this in my head
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
if we do not pass this bill
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
then those lands would not the state
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
could not assist with funding in
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
assistance of those lands that's correct
 
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
so the is for so in any for any new
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
purchase of agricultural lands uh the
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
department uh the department has money
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is available strictly as matching
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
grant money which means that it would
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to be used in order to bring in
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
more federal funds and
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
um because the federal the fed the the
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
ncrs in particular has said that they
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
would not entertain any application Any
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
Grant application unless we had this uh
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
this change done to the law
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay great and for a follow-up man sure
 
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.630 align:start position:0%
okay great and for a follow-up man sure
uh

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
and so let me just read back what you
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
said to make sure it's straight in my
 
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.190 align:start position:0%
said to make sure it's straight in my
head

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.490 align:start position:0%
head
uh

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:27.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
so with this bill the state then helps
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
the landowner in accordance with the
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
current deed
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually so the the process for
 
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.110 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually so the the process for
for

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.370 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to it's it's it's
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
um basically what's called a
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
conservation easement or uh and the what
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the process is a landowner would
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
approach the state uh and potentially uh
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
on land trust uh also and say I have
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
this land that uh I would like to have
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
preserved as agricultural land forever
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
and ever and can you help me with that I
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know I can't you know I can't just
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
give it away because it does I can't
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
just give the the rights away because it
 
00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:20.179 align:start position:0%
does have value so uh
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
so there would be an appraisement of the
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
value of the development rights right
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
and then a new deed would be uh written
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
that would sell just those development
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
rights but not any other ownership
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
rights uh to a combination of the state
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
and whatever other granting agency uh
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
was providing money uh for that sale
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then uh
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
and then the state and those other
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
agencies those other bodies would uh
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility to make sure
 
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.430 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility to make sure
that

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh in the future that preservation of
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
the land is agricultural use would be
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
maintained so in terms of the Deeds
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
right and so the terms of the deed yes
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay great thanks Jeff sure any other
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
questions representative datsey good
 
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.029 align:start position:0%
questions representative datsey good
morning

00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm familiar with conservation
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
easements okay and my understanding of
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
putting a conservation easement on a
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
piece of property is that it's pretty
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
irrevocable very difficult to break so
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
now I'm a little confused because you're
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
talking about this is basically being a
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
deed which is a conservation easement
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
but at some point the land owner can say
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
I want to develop it and I'm going to
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
pay you back money is that where do I
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
get this wrong
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
um okay so uh you're familiar with
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
familiarity with conservation easements
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
comes from ones that have been done in
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
the last say 20 years or so the original
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
law was written in the 1980s when the
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for conservation easements
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
hadn't been very worked very well worked
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
out and they weren't being done for
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural land
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
so the this the original legislation
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
set up a program
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
and the way they set it up then made it
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
possible to reverse to to reverse it
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions if the if this
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee said yes and what
 
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.370 align:start position:0%
committee said yes and what
so

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
what this bill is doing is essentially
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
bringing that more up to date so that uh
 
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.169 align:start position:0%
bringing that more up to date so that uh
any

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:43.970 align:start position:0%
any
uh

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
any land that was acquired for where the
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
development rights were acquired uh
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:54.860 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
using the state's money plus money from
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
other places
 
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:03.620 align:start position:0%
would not uh the the state could not
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
unilaterally say we're taking it out of
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
the easement uh the state the state only
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
has the control over the state's rights
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
in it so the state could say so let's if
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
the state wanted to extinguish its
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
rights in a property that it held
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
jointly with the southeast Land Trust
 
00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:23.149 align:start position:0%
jointly with the southeast Land Trust
then

00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
it could say okay the state doesn't have
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
an interest in this anymore but the land
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
trust will maintain all of its interests
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
so this is actually making a much
 
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.789 align:start position:0%
so this is actually making a much
Solider

00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
Solider
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
um conservation easement or agricultural
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
easement on the land than current law
 
00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:42.110 align:start position:0%
easement on the land than current law
allows

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.450 align:start position:0%
allows
representative

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby is my
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that a lot of conservation
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
easements in the past were done through
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
l-chip which is a completely different
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
program than this is that correct
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes this is a very this is a completely
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
different program from l-chip it
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually precedes l-chip and most of the
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
things that are preserved under it now
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh got preserved before l-chip came on
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative nebb thank you um I have
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
a question for you representative Bixby
 
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.570 align:start position:0%
a question for you representative Bixby
it's

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's easement through this process I
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
mean to representative come to us Point
 
00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:25.130 align:start position:0%
mean to representative come to us Point
sometimes

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
something might be farmed for a time and
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
then not and then goes back into farming
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh I if if it if the land goes into
 
00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:36.539 align:start position:0%
essentially just goes into a natural
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
state that would not be
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
prevented by the um by the deed or that
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
there that might be subject to deed
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
stipulations but I suspect that they
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
would not stipulate that you couldn't
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
just let it go fallow uh that uh I don't
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
think they would say you must Farm it
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
you can't put new buildings on it for
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um this question I
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
guess is for representative Bixby as
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
well so I'm looking here at section uh
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 432 uh colon 25 just regarding
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
development and I didn't really see
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
anything uh any language in there
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
regarding repayment so is this new
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
language that you would be inserting
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
into that area
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
um or where would this be going okay so
 
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.110 align:start position:0%
um or where would this be going okay so
um

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
so what you
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
in the amendment before you anything
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
that is in ordinary type is existing
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
language okay
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh so the new stuff is
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
bold italics uh strikeouts are obviously
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
struck out
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
so perhaps I I guess to that point
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the repayment portion
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
is in another RSA or in another section
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
not in Colon 25 or 4.
 
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.130 align:start position:0%
not in Colon 25 or 4.
um

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
it is in
 
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:12.289 align:start position:0%
it is in
uh

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's in 432.
 
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.010 align:start position:0%
uh it's in 432.
okay

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
um just in the interest of time we have
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
another four bills to get through but I
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
personally would like to propose that we
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment and as we go into
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
the executive session as this would be
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
the final bill on HB 221 and I
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
just want to record I would feel okay
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
about recommending this I don't know how
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
others feel okay thank you for that
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative burlog
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
for this uh thank you madam chair uh
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for this bill to
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
arise was there any previous
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
complications in having the land owner
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
enter a private contractual agreement
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
with the buyer as to
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh honor stipulations with you know uh
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
said deed because what this does now
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
not only the buyer will have to abide by
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
the stipulations of the deed now they'll
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
have to abide by the agricultural
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
preservation restrictions so now we're
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
essentially given the state
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
even more control with what the buyers
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
can do with their land is that is that
 
00:31:35.289 --> 00:31:35.299 align:start position:0%
accurate uh not quite so the the the the
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
landowner so this is this is a voluntary
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
program that a landowner chooses to uh
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
enter and the landowner is actually the
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
seller of and what they sell is not the
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
entire land but they sell the
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
development rights to the on the land so
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
they say uh you can so and the deed
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
would would the deed would specify what
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
those rights are uh what the what
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
develop exactly what the shape of those
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
development rights would be uh and there
 
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
are some fairly standard things that
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
that uh either that the state and the um
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
and other granting agencies would say uh
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be in the deed in order to
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
to make that qualify but so for instance
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
if you sell the development rights
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
um on your farmland
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to then put in a
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
block of residential housing there you
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to put in a um
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
you you wouldn't be able to put in you
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
know a business you know a business
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
building you could depending on how the
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
deed was written you could potentially
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
put in like a new barn
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
a follow-up Madam chair
 
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
so so why couldn't that just be a
 
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
private again contractual agreement with
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the seller and that and then the buyer
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay so uh when uh
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
when it's uh an agreement between say
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
justice say well just use the southeast
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
Land Trust as an example so if there's a
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
um if there is a uh agreement Just
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
Between the southeast land trust and a
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
buyer then uh it would that would be
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
entirely private however there is
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
federal money available in order to uh
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
to make these this this sort of land
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
um land protection more accessible
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
and uh so the federal government will
 
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:38.810 align:start position:0%
and uh so the federal government will
not

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's also State money that is
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
designated just as matching funds for
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
the federal uh for the federal money so
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh and uh the Southeastern land trust
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know they have donors but they they
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
they can't buy yes if they have access
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
to if there's access to Federal money to
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
help out then they can preserve more
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
land so
 
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
land so
um

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.169 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:05.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh the uh if a buyer approaches the
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
South Eastland trust and says I'd like
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
to preserve this land they said they
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
could say let's see if we can get some
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
federal money to do that and get the the
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
state to help us get that Federal money
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you I I think
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
the simplest way to put this
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
representative brilliard is each deed is
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
separate and each landowner can
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
stipulate what they want in that deed
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
nothing is uniform so they can choose or
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
they cannot choose and they can put in
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
any stipulation they want in that deed I
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the reasons I'm okay
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
with it because it's not just what the
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
state is saying the landowner gets to
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just gonna sort of add to
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
that if I can make a comment that yes
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
that's true I mean you could put in hoop
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
houses like usually for agricultural
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
easements you put in a lot of language
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
that allows Farmers the most flexibility
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
on the land and an easement is always
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
held by somebody whether it's held by
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
the state or Southeast Land Trust so
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
when a property is sold or bequeathed to
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
the next person it always comes with
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
that easement on it and there's always
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
some you know primary easement holder
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a the town is a
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
secondary easement holder of the state
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be a secondary easement holder
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
it's never you know it's just probably
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
like having an easement that allows a
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
utility company to go across your
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
property it's always part of the sale so
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's not you know it's not ever a
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
private transaction that would be
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
between the first landowner and the
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
second representative Murray uh thank
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
you and if I'm reading this correctly to
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
under to your point or my initial
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
question it's in uh 432 colon 24
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
regarding release of uh land and so um
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
it does say here that uh public funds
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
may be released so it's not necessarily
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
the case that that would happen because
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
it's permissive language there correct
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary that the
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
um agricultural land development rights
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
board that meets would necessarily
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
release it
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
assumes up to the discretion of that
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
board yes the the board would make any
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
decision about any
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
um what would be what's called
 
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.130 align:start position:0%
um what would be what's called
extinguishment

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
extinguishment
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
um but the way that what this bill does
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
is it says that the state can only
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
extinguish their interest in it they
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
can't so if there are other interests
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
um I think uh it's pretty clear uh that
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
we will be executing this bill later
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
this afternoon with this amendment
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
so uh I would like to move on now
 
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
so uh I would like to move on now
to

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.250 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:55.940 align:start position:0%
a discussion on HB 253
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
 
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.970 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
um

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you had some
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
language here that was that maybe uh
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
something that you want to put together
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
as an amendment for this bill but has
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
not been drafted as an amendment is that
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay would you
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
like to uh go over that with the
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
committee today sure uh so one of the
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
things that uh came up in the hearing is
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
that it seemed like the
 
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.530 align:start position:0%
that it seemed like the
um

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
the language in terms of the duties was
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
not and well actually I'm going to deal
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
with one thing very quickly uh there the
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
numbers are the the original Bill asked
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
for two members of the Senate we never
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
managed to get two members of the Senate
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
if we send over to send it over to the
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
Senate with that in it they will send it
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
back uh with an amendment saying we only
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're only going to give you one Senator
 
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
we're only going to give you one Senator
so

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think we might as well take the
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
work off work away from them and just do
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
that here okay um agree with that so so
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's the easy part
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
um and then the uh in terms of the
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
duties uh I think there was a general
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
sense that the duties that were laid out
 
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.609 align:start position:0%
sense that the duties that were laid out
um

00:38:15.609 --> 00:38:15.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill were not
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
um quite specific enough and uh it it uh
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
gave a little bit and there was a desire
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
for a little bit more Direction uh so
 
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.450 align:start position:0%
for a little bit more Direction uh so
um

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
I maintained the general idea that
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
um we that the committee would you know
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
um look at epr in terms of waste
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
reduction and in terms of reducing the
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
tax burden uh because that is that is an
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
important part of it uh we don't we
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to suggest epr legislation
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that would somehow increase the tax
 
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.829 align:start position:0%
that would somehow increase the tax
burden

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and that and and decreasing the tax
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
burden is certainly one of uh several
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
motivations for doing this sort of uh
 
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.349 align:start position:0%
motivations for doing this sort of uh
legislation

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:04.010 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of laws in other
 
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of laws in other
um

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
in other states and in Canada in Europe
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
that uh deal with extended producer
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility in a broad range of areas
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
including packaging single-use Plastics
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
beverage containers electronic waste
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
batteries automotive waste hazardous
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
waste there are some there are other
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
ones too I just this is
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
um I this list is not intended to be
 
00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
um I this list is not intended to be
exhaustive

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
exhaustive
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh and uh rather than
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
um Reinventing the wheel it would
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
probably make sense to see what's out
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
there and see what might be adaptable to
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so
 
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.390 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so
um

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
and so that so uh one uh specific job of
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
the committee would be to look at laws
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
and other jurisdictions and see what we
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
might be able to uh use in New Hampshire
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh which is
 
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.430 align:start position:0%
um and uh which is
um

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
and then uh the next step is looking at
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
how look at looking at the process of
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
adapting those lots in New Hampshire and
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
one thing that would be critical to that
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
would be working with the Department of
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to make sure that
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
uh they would be able to implement
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
whatever we
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
um whatever we put together I had the
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
um I had a learning learning experience
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
several terms ago putting a bill in for
 
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:42.740 align:start position:0%
electronic waste
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
epr and uh discovering that uh the way
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
they do it in Vermont just wouldn't work
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because the way our uh
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
because of the structure of our transfer
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
stations and our recycling centers and
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the way that uh that
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
the that those cooperate with us at the
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
state level and uh the system that it
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
was set up Vermont just wouldn't be
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
practical in New Hampshire
 
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.930 align:start position:0%
practical in New Hampshire
and

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:16.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
so it ended up dying because uh it was
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to take too much work to fix
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure we don't want to
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
put ourselves put the the study
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee in the position of you know
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
putting together a proposal and not
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
having it vetted with Des to make sure
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
it would work with our current systems
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.329 align:start position:0%
it would work with our current systems
um

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
and solicit industry stakeholder input
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
on approaches that the manufacturers and
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
Distributors would best be able to
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
undertake or facilitate
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is really important we've had some
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
interest from uh various industry groups
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
saying we would like to be at the table
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
for this process and uh because the idea
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
of extended producer responsibility is
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that those those producers take
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility we want to make sure that
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
we in are have them in a discussion so
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
that they can suggest the ways that they
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
would best be able to take
 
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.390 align:start position:0%
would best be able to take
responsibility

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
responsibility
um

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation for implementing
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
approaches that would be readily
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
adaptable to New Hampshire so that is
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know if it looks like the committee
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
can put together some draft legislation
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
or sort of the outlines of draft draft
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for something that could be
 
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:38.180 align:start position:0%
brought forward uh in the coming year
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
then that is something that uh the
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
committee could do it might be that some
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
of the uh the
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
um projects that they'd be looking at
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
would be more complicated than they
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
could put together given the scope given
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
the scope and the time and in that case
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
they could put together they could write
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
legislation for a further study
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee that would be narrowly
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
targeted to doing that further type of
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
legislation so that's that's kind of
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking about uh one thing
 
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.890 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking about uh one thing
that

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
um that to keep in mind is that any
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
study committee will has the power to
 
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.950 align:start position:0%
study committee will has the power to
essentially

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.450 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
control the scope of what they were
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
studying to the extent that they can
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually get the work done so uh it is
 
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
actually get the work done so uh it is
it

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
the if you say study all epr everywhere
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
and come up with a comprehensive
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
Solution that's not going to work in uh
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know in a study committee that's
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to last for two or three weeks two
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
or three months at the most uh so you
 
00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:52.309 align:start position:0%
or three months at the most uh so you
um

00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
so essentially there there needs to be
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
some mechanism for limiting the scope
 
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.790 align:start position:0%
some mechanism for limiting the scope
but

00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
um the committee itself has a fair
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
amount of leeway in terms of deciding
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
what's you know how deeply they're going
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
to to be getting into any particular
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
part of it okay representative Bixby I
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
have a couple comments number one from
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the original Bill there is a line line
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
17 that says the committee May solicit
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
input from any person or entity the
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
committee deems relevant to its study I
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
would like to see that line included in
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
this okay I I I'd have no objection to
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
it I I my sense is that that is that
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
almost goes without saying with study
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
committees but if you feel more
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that in there I'd be
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
happy to put it back in okay thank you
 
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.910 align:start position:0%
happy to put it back in okay thank you
also

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.809 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
so my sense from the my feeling from the
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
original bill was that the charge was
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
very Broad
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
and that we needed to be more specific
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I see that you've made an attempt to
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
to Really hone in on certain aspects of
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
um what we're putting in our landfills
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned packaging single-use
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
Plastics beverage containers electronic
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
waste batteries automotive waste and
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
for me I think that really is a pretty
 
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.069 align:start position:0%
for me I think that really is a pretty
large

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.890 align:start position:0%
large
Focus

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:23.900 align:start position:0%
Focus
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
especially to have a report done by
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
November 1st and I'm wondering if
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's something we can do to
 
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
there's something we can do to
um maybe

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
rein that in a little bit
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
should we as a committee be more
 
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.250 align:start position:0%
should we as a committee be more
um

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know choose more of a priorities of
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
of what these items here are listed
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we leave off packaging and just
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
single-use Plastics beverage containers
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
electronic waste and I don't know let's
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
let's pick a couple of these or three or
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
four of these instead of so many is what
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
my thought is represent uh thank you
 
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.870 align:start position:0%
madam chair
um

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was discussed during our hearing that
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you it's a very broad
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
scope what we have here and I thought
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we discussed and
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
maybe and I thought there was a
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
consensus is that we would actually look
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
at materials that were had high toxicity
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
and go after the most toxic
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
waste first because really that's what
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
we're trying to eliminate in our our
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
landfills is is the toxic waste and
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
reduce that and I think if we did
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
something where it talked about the the
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
toxicity of the waste
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
um as just opposed to all of it
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that none of it this
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
isn't all of it's not toxic but there's
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
levels of toxicity in different waste I
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
mean I'm assuming that batteries are
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
much more toxic than a single-use
 
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.089 align:start position:0%
much more toxic than a single-use
plastic

00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's where I thought we were
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
going with this but I could be wrong
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.069 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
um

00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.329 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh the one
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that's a little bit makes
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
us a little bit more complicated is uh
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
we are learning that there is
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
um there's pfas in packaging there is
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
pfas and single-use Plastics uh and so
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh and and pfas is certainly it's toxic
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
and we know that it is one of the things
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
that makes leech leachate problematic uh
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
which is so
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
um what might make sense is
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
um adding uh part of the charge to
 
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.790 align:start position:0%
um adding uh part of the charge to
um

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
a set of for the committee to assess the
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
these in terms of their likelihood of
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
um of reducing toxicity in landfills and
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
then uh and then have them focus on
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
those that will be most effective in
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
just to follow up and I understand about
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
the pfas and we're all worried about
 
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
that and that's something new that has
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
come about in most recent years but pfas
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
is in everything it's in the rain that's
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
dumping that we're getting put on our
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
land it's in our cosmetics and it's in
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
the clothing we wear I mean pay fast is
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
everywhere I mean so to study just pfas
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
I think you have to be more specific
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
because it is in everything
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
chair I also just want to make sure that
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
we're making efficient use of our time
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
there are already limitations on certain
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
things like battery disposal so I happen
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
to wonder if those are areas that do
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
have certain parameters on how they are
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
disposed of and when you can do a waste
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
take back day in your communities I
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
agree that that's an important part of
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
the discussion but I think there are
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
already disposal regulations around
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
those and Under Universal waste so I'm
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
wondering if that makes sense
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
to maybe look at some of the other
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
topics as well representative Howard
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I agree with
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um that that there
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
are already
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
um systems in place and also a lot of
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
those things have labels on them so fine
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
you know the resourcing the original
 
00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
um uh provider is pretty obvious so
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that we had talked before
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
about enhancing alternative packaging or
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
um and single-use packaging is is
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
probably a big uh bite to to chew for a
 
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.030 align:start position:0%
probably a big uh bite to to chew for a
committee

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I I would
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
like to add a third I guess to the
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
comments of Representatives uh Murray
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
and Howard and uh and point out that I
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
think having spoken with some of the
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
folks at in the landfill in Keene for
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
example that the the packaging I think
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
is an important element of this because
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the space you know there are a number
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
of landfills like the one in Keene that
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
are starting to run out of space uh and
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that also leads to increased you
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
know tipping fees you have to then kind
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
of ship things further away so there are
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
implications to the uh
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
overabundance of kind of the packaging
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
that ends up in landfills as well so I
 
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I I do agree I think with
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative Murray that I think that
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
there are significant controls already
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
around toxic substances and how they're
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
disposed of so uh from from my
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
perspective the the packaging element of
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
this is is important
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative dutzie
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved in this for
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
probably about the last year doing a lot
 
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
of webinars I've said this before and
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm involved with a Plastics working
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
group for the New Hampshire networks and
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
I can tell you epr and this whole
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics thing uh it's enormous and
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
trying to to wrap your head around where
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
you want to focus and what you want to
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
do is very very difficult for example I
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
mean if you talk about single-use
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
plastic okay what are we talking about
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
because a water bottle is a single-use
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
plastic okay so so things overlap I
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
agree with uh chair Aarons that we don't
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
want to be you know too broad in this
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
but I think we've reduced it to some of
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
the issues in in this amendment that you
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
know are really pertinent and I think
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
part of the charge of the the committee
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
is to really grapple with what areas you
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
know do we focus on because it's it's so
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
enormous and allowing them this amount
 
00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
of discretion that's in this amendment I
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
think it you know is appropriate so that
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
they might be able to work down and make
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh if we make it too
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
narrow then we I think we hamstring them
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
but I will be the first one to say this
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
is not going to be easy and that's why I
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
think we need a committee on it to at
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
least take the first draft
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just like in my head I'm
 
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just like in my head I'm
thinking

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
why would we not just tell Des they're
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
the ones with the expertise they're the
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
ones with the knowledge and the and the
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
tentacles that go into the different
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
organizations so I just back it up a
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
step and you know we've heard numerous
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
times to limit the number of committees
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
and study groups and that type of thing
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
why would we not just say Des take a
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
come back to us and and give us a
 
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:08.540 align:start position:0%
response representative dutzie
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton because I don't
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Des does not have the staff and this
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
issue is something where you really have
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
to drill down and you really have to do
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of research and you have to get a
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
lot of stakeholders in I mean because
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
um you know representative Bixby is is
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
correct I mean we need stakeholders
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
involved you're really talking about a
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
lot of time and from what I've seen in
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
this committee I don't believe that Des
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
has that ability right now and probably
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
would see this as a a benefit to them to
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
be able to help them give some get some
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
direction very similar to the solid
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
waste committee that we have going right
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
now that would be my but you can you can
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
ask you can ask director wimsat and he
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
might be able to give you more Direction
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay thanks representative thank you
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair have a couple different
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
questions but one is for representative
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
dutzy you said you're been working with
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
a group could you what was that group's
 
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.370 align:start position:0%
a group could you what was that group's
name

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh well uh there is a there is a group
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
of citizens in New Hampshire it's called
 
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire networks and if I look
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
at it um a group of very bright
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
um educated experienced people and if I
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
kind of think about it in my mind
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's a number of different
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
ways to go at it but they basically
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
focus on energy and they both focus on
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh waste reduction Plastics so the two
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
groups that I know they have right now
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
is they have a styrofoam
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
um working committee to collect
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
Styrofoam in the in in the state and
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
densify it up in Guilford because
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a densifier at the Guilford
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
transfer station and then they also have
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
the Plastics working group where they're
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
educating people in the towns about
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
single-use Plastics so it's a big
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
educational Focus but you know when you
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
when you start talking about all of the
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
layers of waste that we have
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a lot to un unwrap
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
and the question is what do you focus on
 
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:25.700 align:start position:0%
so so it's this is an outside group
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
non-profit no whatever it's just a group
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
that's already working in New Hampshire
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
working on what we're saying we want to
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
study is that correct kind of
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh no they're they're looking at it more
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know as an educational perspective
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
so for example when you do your takeout
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know you you call and take out you
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
bring it home and you're given a plastic
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
spoon a plastic fork and a plastic knife
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
which you put in the drawer because
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to use your own you know so
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're educating people to say Hey you
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
know restaurateurs just ask somebody if
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
they need plastic utensils if they don't
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
need the plastic utensils then don't
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
give it to them they're trying to come
 
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
up with other ways
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you know to not use single plastic so
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
so it's more that focused they're
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're not focused
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
um on I would say the higher level epr
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
which is what this is it's more on the
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
user level
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and one more yes
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
representative on another topic online
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh five it says here that the study
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
group will propose legislation for
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
implementing approaches
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
um what if the best approach is to have
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
Des Implement rules and not legislation
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
why are we limiting it to legislation
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
chair and I just to sort of address both
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Creighton and
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative kompa um since the
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
Inception of House Bill 617 back in 20
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
000 uh 2019
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
um where there was a study committee to
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
start looking at some of these things
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
and epr was a concept that came up
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
during those um study committees
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to note that
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
there were members from Des there
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh who gave their input I would imagine
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
that a given uh the charge here that is
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
re-outlined that it would function
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
similarly they'd have the opportunity to
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
be a part of that conversation just as
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
we had the bottle and beverage industry
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
there we had Hospital Management Systems
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
there to talk about various aspects of
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
solid waste so I think drilling down to
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
that there there's absolutely still a
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
place for the Department to be a part of
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
this conversation and should be
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
um and to your point regarding
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking there are times in which
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is an appropriate Avenue but
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
before we get to that point we have to
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
at least look at
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
where those appropriate places may be
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
right but it doesn't have comfortable
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
you may follow up thank you madam chair
 
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
but this year it just says proposed
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
legislation it doesn't say proposed
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
legislation or discuss rulemaking uh
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
that should be implemented it just says
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and I I would even add
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
that instead of the language proposed
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation I might even uh appreciate
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
suggest possible legislation as language
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
be put in the amendment representative
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
Bixby you had your hand up yes I was I
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that I would be
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
happy to change that line to okay so you
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
say suggest possible legislation
 
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.270 align:start position:0%
say suggest possible legislation
uh

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
or rules or rules
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
put that change in sure
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
um and would that also
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to say for the next line
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
propose more specifically targeted study
 
00:59:10.089 --> 00:59:10.099 align:start position:0%
legislation suggest possible
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted study legislation
 
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.670 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted study legislation
foreign

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
propose more I would say suggest
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:24.109 align:start position:0%
propose more I would say suggest
possible

00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
with director wimsat would you like to
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
weigh in on uh anything that you've
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
heard from the committee if the
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't mind no okay
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to a committee suggesting
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
rules for Des and
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
anything else that you've heard sure yes
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chairman good morning
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh for those who don't know me
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
I'm Mike wimsatta service director of
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
the waste management division for New
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
um yeah a couple of comments and thank
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
you for the invitation
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I would note is that
 
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.910 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I would note is that
really

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know any rulemaking that that Des
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
embarks on
 
01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:11.540 align:start position:0%
must be and is
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
essentially an authority that's
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
delegated to the agency
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
somewhat specifically through the
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
statute so in the case of solid waste
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's some general you know uh well
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
both both specific in general there's a
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
section on rulemaking and it in the
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
statute it directs the agency to make
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
rules on very specific things and uh
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
right now to my knowledge we don't have
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
authority to just you know sort of
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
unilaterally as an agency decide we
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
would like to impose epr requirements
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
for a particular product and then embark
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
on rulemaking to do that we it would
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
have to be implemented through a law and
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
if a statue if they're going to be a
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
bill that would do that I would Envision
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
that it would say you know an epr
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
program for such and such should be
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
established and then under the
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
rulemaking section in the statute it
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
would say yes she'll make rules to set
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
out the the provisions and structure of
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
this particular program and these zpr
 
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
requirements so I don't think as I
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
understand I don't think we would be
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
empowered as an agency unilaterally to
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
in in embarking rulemaking to in impose
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
an epr requirement and that's as it
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
should be I'm not disappointed about
 
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
should be I'm not disappointed about
that

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
um so uh the other other I guess points
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
I would make is that it's actually
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
really helpful when committees get
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
together you know uh representative
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
Murray who participated on uh you know
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
the house bill 413 I think it was uh
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
study committee for solid waste you know
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
again that committee set a record I
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
think they had 16 meetings in four weeks
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
or something like that they were very
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
energetic it was very helpful I think to
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
um but also to the agency we did
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
participate we we tried to have someone
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
at each one of those meetings we
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes provided testimony in those
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
things but but we also listened we
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
learned an awful lot from the
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the members and the you
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
know the solid voice industry uh folks
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
who you know major sectors that generate
 
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:07.220 align:start position:0%
solid ways the hospitals were there
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturers were there so it was
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
really helpful in in and and to be
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
candid we have a very full plate at DES
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
for us to unilaterally or orchestrate
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
something like that and drive that home
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
could do it but it would mean that you
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
know all the the many hours we would
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
spend organizing that would mean we
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
weren't doing other things that this
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
court has asked us to do so there's
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
always a you know checks and balances
 
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
there thank you for that I just have one
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
question though I know you sit on the
 
01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:38.780 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
to what extent will some of this be
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
covered in in the study from that group
 
01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to you know have uh
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
two two bodies doing the same kind of
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
work sure that's a great question and of
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
course that group does have a very big
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
charge and it and it meets over a period
 
01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
of five years it's already a year in at
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
um I I I I won't speak for the committee
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
as a whole I'm a member or the
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
commission I'm a member of the
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
commission and I think that you know I
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
I've heard others say you know it would
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
be helpful to to have you know that
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
particular piece someone else looking at
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't mean that they might not
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
all because again this committee if this
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill passes and this committee is
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
created it is work it's work is
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
ostensibly done by November 1st right
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
and this commission will go on for you
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
know another three or four years so the
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
work that it would do what what it would
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
learn I think would
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
feed into and be a great source of
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
information for that commission to
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
potentially look further at that because
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
these things are difficult right and I
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
understand and you know I I my
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
sympathies with committee members who
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to learn all this and then to
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
provide a report by November 1st because
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
that happens really fast so one
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
advantage is that if that's the schedule
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
that it happens on whatever that
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
committee learns can then feed into the
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
commission and the commission can do
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
further analysis and further work with
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
any other comment that you have to offer
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
no the only other thing I would note is
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
that um what I think was really powerful
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the 413 committee is that uh the
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
committee members the group of
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
legislators really became expert they
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
learned a lot in a short period of time
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
and it made them very powerful advocates
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
for future legislation when they could
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
share and learning with their colleagues
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
so I think that you know from that
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
perspective those that's one benefit the
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee has that that you wouldn't get
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
is just Des did a study and gave you a
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
report because you're gonna you're
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
basically all the work that committee
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
does those committee members are being
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
educated okay thank you
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative datsey uh yeah I mean
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about if we're talking
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
about the solid waste working group okay
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
isn't that chaired by representative
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
evil yes it is okay and representative
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
Ebel is a co-sponsor on this bill so by
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
that I would assume that she probably
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know feels pretty much like what
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
director wimsat said is that this would
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
would be additive rather than just
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
detractive from it okay yeah I sit on
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
that group too but I just have been to
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
one meeting because I am a recent
 
01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:17.870 align:start position:0%
one meeting because I am a recent
appointee

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
appointee
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't sure though you know if they
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
had this in the works that they're
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
working on anything so but anyway
 
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh any other question or comment um
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Compton did you have a
 
01:05:35.289 --> 01:05:35.299 align:start position:0%
comment before no okay
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby you have further
 
01:05:42.609 --> 01:05:42.619 align:start position:0%
so um one thing that I'm wondering is if
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh there needs to be one more line uh in
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
here that explicitly says that uh the uh
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
study committee will set priorities for
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
what they're studying so that
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
um so that so rather than so rather than
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
us saying in advance well we're going to
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
strike out some of the things in section
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
two we can say that the study committee
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
will set priorities regarding these from
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
among these items yeah
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
of what they will
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
so I I yeah I agree I mean I think we
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
can give them the option of studying all
 
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
because as it is I really do believe
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very broad
 
01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:35.650 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very broad
um

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:35.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
albeit very important uh content here
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it is somewhat unrealistic
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
to think that they would be able to have
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive report for
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
all of those items uh coming November
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
1st so if if we can word this in some
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
way that they can study existing epr
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
laws in other U.S and international
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions regarding
 
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:08.900 align:start position:0%
all or some of the
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
subsequent list
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
if you catch my drift yeah yeah
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
Maria yeah I was just gonna say maybe as
 
01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:22.130 align:start position:0%
Maria yeah I was just gonna say maybe as
um

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the uh
 
01:07:27.529 --> 01:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at other us and
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
international jurisdictions regarding
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
um the goals outlined before the study
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
committee maybe that's
 
01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah if I could make a comment
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
here I I think if we get if if we agree
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
in committee on
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
on the fact that we want to give the
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the study committee the the
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
power to
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
um prioritize and perhaps leave some
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
stuff out if it doesn't fit uh then we
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
can figure out the wording of that not
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
in committee because trying to enter the
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
documents with 20 people is just crazy
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
well you're a good worth Smith I think
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
that uh if for your Amendment you may be
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
able to come up with the right rewarding
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
for that representative Murray uh thanks
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um I would like to not
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily push back but ask for
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
further clarification on the rule making
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
and Trust to be clear that we do not set
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
rules either that is something the
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
department does so I I want to make sure
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions regarding
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
okay so um I suppose representative
 
01:08:47.809 --> 01:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
Bixby you will be working with OLS to
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
put this amendment together and uh it
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
01:08:56.329 --> 01:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
pretty likely we will not be executing
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
this today but uh we will I would I
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
would say that it's definite we won't be
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
exactly because I don't think there's
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be time to talk to OLS and
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
actually get them to do something sure
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't like to put them under that
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
kind of pressure for something
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.150 align:start position:0%
kind of pressure for something
absolutely

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I I'm expecting there will be an
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
amendment brought to the committee next
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
week when we uh when we set a subsequent
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
executive and I can circulate a draft uh
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
before it gets you know set us down okay
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments on this
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative partial you would like to
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
um seeing no other question or comment
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the epr study uh bill of HB
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
253 let us move on to HB 56
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and also we can discuss hb602 at the
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
same time since there's similar bills
 
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:08.810 align:start position:0%
same time since there's similar bills
um

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
and those are relative to the permits
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
for the sighting of new landfills so why
 
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.060 align:start position:0%
don't we uh kick off our discussion
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
regarding what we heard from the
 
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:23.420 align:start position:0%
hearings as well as how we feel about
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
both of these bills proposed bills
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
would anybody like to begin
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
with a comment questions
 
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Murray yep thank you
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair and then Betsy uh thank you
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
very much so um with regard to
 
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.110 align:start position:0%
very much so um with regard to
um

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
both of the bills I think that we did
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
hear some very thoughtful feedback at
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
the hearing last time that uh
 
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
there are some things that we could
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
potentially have some clarification
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
around and and with that I also wanted
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
to just mention that I had distributed
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh at the
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
hearing an amendment that was number I'm
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
just wanting to make sure I have that
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
correct zero six zero nine H I am
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
working off of an electronic copy but
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
you all had a paper copy that I
 
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
you all had a paper copy that I
distributed

01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
um last week and so with that I would
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
like to make sure that the committee
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
takes that under consideration as we're
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
sure would you like to uh speak to that
 
01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:28.669 align:start position:0%
sure would you like to uh speak to that
Amendment

01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:31.940 align:start position:0%
all right that's uh
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
2023-0609h does everyone have a copy of
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the yes the amendment basically further
 
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.189 align:start position:0%
the yes the amendment basically further
clarifies

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
um that pre-existing landfills are are
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
protected in Statue were grandfathered
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
in to the um the underlying bill it had
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
been stated previously
 
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:57.410 align:start position:0%
been stated previously
um

01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
so some paragraph there the changes are
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
in sub paragraphs C and D pretty much
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
exclusively and it just um some
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
paragraphs see
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
um just asked that there any any
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
landfill that exists that has fully been
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
permitted that is fully permanent is an
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
actively accepting wastes is has been
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
Exempted under that so that is a
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
clarification it also just continues to
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
further say that um perennial bodies of
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
water traversing a footprint even if
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
they are pre-existing should still be
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
monitored in accordance in accordance
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
with or exceeding the US EPA regulations
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
and guidelines that's the first change
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
there the second is in uh
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
in subparagraph D where it does say that
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
the department May adopt certain rules
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
under 541a to allow for project
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
improvements and allowances there are
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
some thoughts um I don't know how the
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee feels about
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
um those and I'm happy to bring that up
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
for discussion but one of the
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
um those are certain offsets relative to
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
distance to travel and I'm I'm happy to
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh discuss those there was one other
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
thing on line 19 that I did want to
 
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.390 align:start position:0%
thing on line 19 that I did want to
notice

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about hydraulic
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
conductivity where it says 1 times 10
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
and it looks like minus five but it's
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
supposed to be to the negative fifth
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
power and for whatever reason when
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
drafting happened that did not translate
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
that way so I have two other suggestions
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
for how that could potentially be
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
written to avoid that looking visually
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
like that and potentially being
 
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.250 align:start position:0%
like that and potentially being
misinterpreted

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:46.739 --> 01:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
representative
Bixby

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
um one thing that um
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit concerned about is the
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh it seems like the
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um allowances that
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
um the the project project of
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
improvement allowances are very
 
01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.229 align:start position:0%
improvement allowances are very
um

01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
Loosely defined uh and uh I'm not sure
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
that uh given how Loosely defined they
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
are whether that is something that
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
um Des would be capable would be
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
comfortable making rule rules about
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it's you know I'm not it's it's
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
it's I I'm wondering if we if that would
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
need to be more directive in order for
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
them to successfully make rules
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we could get a comment from the
 
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'm chair um
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh I got a very clear or very strong
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
message from the Department the Des
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
Representatives that are hearing that
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
they thought that this legislation is
 
01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.669 align:start position:0%
they thought that this legislation is
premature

01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
premature
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
and that they were wanted resources or
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
time to to do their own study and I'm
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about an answer to that but
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
as I went back and looked at the old
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
bills that did not pass I came to the
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion that
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
for them to have studied this
 
01:15:32.169 --> 01:15:32.179 align:start position:0%
has not taken place so
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
I think more time for more study seems
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
to me to just be kicking the ball down
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to make a decision
 
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to make a decision
representative

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.290 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
having been through a lot of these bills
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
and listening to this for a long time
 
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.970 align:start position:0%
and listening to this for a long time
um

01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
I think that mandating them to study
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
this through legislation has not been
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
done in the past and I think that
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
mandating the study is the way to go my
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
biggest concern
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
um with hb602 when when we had that
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearing was that we're putting into
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislation things that Maine has some
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
of it in legislation and some of it in
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
rule making and that really concerned me
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
because if you put everything into
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and statute it doesn't leave
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
any room for anything and as we heard in
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
testimony Maine was including a lot of
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
exceptions through the rulemaking
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
process and I think we need to be very
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
very careful
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
from taking another state statute and
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
rules and adopting it into our statute
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
we are not Maine our geography is not
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
Maine I have looked at the geography of
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
this state can compared to Maine I've
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the demographics of the state
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
compared to Maine it is not comparing
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples and I think we need to
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I mean if you had
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
asked me before this process started
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
what the setback was for a landfill and
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
a body of water I think I would have
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
told you half a mile so I'm appalled
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
that it's 200 feet in my town I can't
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
build a deck 200 feet from a body of
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
water or Wetland so
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that law has been in
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
place for 30 years it's too long it's
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
not enough of a setback and I you know I
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
agree with representative come to all I
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
um HB 602 is really ready for prime time
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in it that
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
isn't defined we heard that in testimony
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I agree with that point that
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
um that is a bill that I think needs
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
more work it it feels like it came
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
together really quickly and it's just
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
not ready but I think uh HB 56 is in a
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
better place I think we have to start
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
somewhere I mean this has been 30 years
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the same setback and it's not enough
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
of a protection I don't you know I don't
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
think you need to be a scientist to say
 
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
200 feet it's not enough of a distance
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative NAB to your point and I I
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
know we keep bringing up the 200 foot
 
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.810 align:start position:0%
know we keep bringing up the 200 foot
setback

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
setback
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
but that's only a minimum
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
it is not what the setback has to be
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
it's a minimum setback it could be you
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
could say that the minimum is 200 feet
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
but Des could come in and tell you that
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
it has to be a half a mile it's just
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
setting a minimum
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Murray ah thank you madam
 
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
chair and I think uh to both of the
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
points that are well made by
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
Representatives NAB and Cultura
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think what we are asking for is
 
01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:46.100 align:start position:0%
Clarity in the statute to say that
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic study has to precede any
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
sort of setback and so in doing so I
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
think that is why we are we are asking
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
for some clarity around this we have
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
seen that um
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation came before us and the
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
house had a very strong position in a
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan manner uh last legislative
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
season and I I expect that it's no
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
different seeing that there are two
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
members from opposite parties trying to
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
bring forward language to help clarify
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage us to continue to
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with representative Bixby
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
that there's perhaps some conversation
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
around the exceptions or the uh the
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
allowances that they can maybe be clunky
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
or cumbersome and I'm happy to work with
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
you or anybody in the in the committee
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh to make that a little bit more clear
 
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
or perhaps maybe remove it
 
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Contour thank you and I
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
believe this is probably a question for
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the director
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
um do we require hydrogeological
 
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
whatever that we are asking for
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question and yeah
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
as has been noted by one of the other
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
committee members the the 200 foot
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
setback is the minimum when a new
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
landfill is proposed to be cited
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a requirement to do a a
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
thorough hydrogeological study and there
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
are provisions of rule that make it very
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.410 align:start position:0%
clear that
um

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
the sighting of the landfill needs to
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that certain things can be
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
accomplished one of which is that
 
01:20:31.689 --> 01:20:31.699 align:start position:0%
surface waters are protected adequately
 
01:20:31.699 --> 01:20:33.370 align:start position:0%
surface waters are protected adequately
that

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:33.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater is protected adequately and
 
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.130 align:start position:0%
groundwater is protected adequately and
that

01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
um the landfill once constructed and
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
operating can be monitored effectively
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
to ensure that you understand whether
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's performing as designed and then if
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
it isn't performing is designed that you
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to address that and
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
correct it so
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
um the short answer your question is yes
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's a thorough hydrogeological
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
Society that's required prior to
 
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.030 align:start position:0%
Society that's required prior to
permitting

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh yes but thank
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
you I think to the director's point
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
though it isn't set in rules is that
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
correct it's not in statute
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
the language I just described is is just
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
is in statute or is in rules that's
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:21:16.679 --> 01:21:18.290 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
so

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
I I have a question based on testimony
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
by Nikki delude Roy
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
from verdantis
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
and she had stated that
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year time of travel
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
consideration included in HB 56
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.739 --> 01:21:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
um and

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
maybe more conservative than necessary
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
is there a way that perhaps we might
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
put into this
 
01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:54.260 align:start position:0%
um HP 56
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
rather than flatly saying a five-year
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
distance of travel
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
because if that's an arbitrary number
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we want to try
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
and get away from is arbitrary numbers
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
is there a way in which we might want to
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
reword it to give more flexibility based
 
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:20.540 align:start position:0%
on what the hydro hydrological
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh results are
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
yeah

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.050 align:start position:0%
um so
the

01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
um one one aspect of that is that um
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
it is a common argumentative technique
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
to declare something arbitrary if you
 
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
don't like it uh so I'm not uh that the
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:48.830 align:start position:0%
don't like it uh so I'm not uh that the
[Music]

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
um the idea behind a five-year setback
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
is that uh in order to uh So currently
 
01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:02.300 align:start position:0%
Des uh tests roughly every three months
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.050 align:start position:0%
uh and so
um

01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
there could be a three-month delay
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
before discovering a leak uh so that and
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
then uh and then when you discover one
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a set there needs to
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
be an assessment of you know what is
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
what is it that we're actually seeing
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
here that assessment can take time also
 
01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:26.900 align:start position:0%
then there needs to be
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
a determination of what needs to be done
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
in order to prevent it from going
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
further establish setting up a plan in
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
order to implement that doing the
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
implementation those steps can all take
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of time so the idea it be
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
between five years with a five-year
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
setback is that if you have five years
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
um of if the distance is going to be
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
five years between uh when the leak
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
occurs and when it hits the sensitive
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
body of water
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
then you have enough time to discover it
 
01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.930 align:start position:0%
then you have enough time to discover it
uh

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
assess it
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
created a remediation plan and put that
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
in and start putting that in place uh if
 
01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
in and start putting that in place uh if
you

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
if uh you don't have that much time then
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
you may recognize as a problem and then
 
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:29.780 align:start position:0%
whoops it's in the river already
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
so uh what we so the idea behind having
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
five years is that it is it it really
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
gives you the time in order to uh to do
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
the work and that five years is
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
determined through hydrogen
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological assessment of the site
 
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.470 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological assessment of the site
and

01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
it is true that the hydrogeology
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
may be different between the site and
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
the sensitive bodies of water so it
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
might not be exactly five years that you
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
measure it could be if you measure five
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
years at based on the if you're if your
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
estimate is five years based on what is
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
right near the the landfill
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh there it might in fact actually only
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
be three years because things might be
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
more porous as you get closer to the
 
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
body of water it could be seven years
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
but uh if you don't so another aspect of
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
that five years is that given that you
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
can't ask you you can't
 
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:35.300 align:start position:0%
demand that every landowner between the
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
proposed site and the body of water
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
allow you access in order to do a series
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
of tests on their property in every
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
direction uh you have to make some
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
guesses uh and but by making it five
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
years it gives you enough of a buffer so
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
that uh you do have the time and it to
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
to repair something if it
 
01:25:59.219 --> 01:26:00.350 align:start position:0%
to repair something if it
um

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh if that becomes an issue the other
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
thing is that if you determine if if you
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
do this as a
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
very early step in the process than a
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
company that wants to build a landfill
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
can look at a perspective site do a
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
certain number of Geo hydrogeological
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
assessments and say oh no actually we
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
can't do this here let's not spend any
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
more money on it as opposed to getting
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
way into the process and then realizing
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
they've spent a whole they've already
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
sunk a whole lot of money in trying to
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
make a site work and then discovering
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they can't make it work you don't
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
want if you're gonna you want to be able
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
to assess very early on if it's going to
 
01:26:46.139 --> 01:26:48.709 align:start position:0%
to assess very early on if it's going to
work

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Contour thank you madam
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
chair just in reviewing the testimony
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
from Sanborn head
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and this was in regards to hb602
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
um they actually said you know
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a two-year travel distance and
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
then allow for rulemaking uh the Des to
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
adopt new rules based on subjective
 
01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.709 align:start position:0%
adopt new rules based on subjective
criteria

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
and give them because we know that our
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
landscape is Ever Changing we know that
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
our streams and our groundwater is
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
changing constantly under underneath of
 
01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.229 align:start position:0%
changing constantly under underneath of
us

01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and so maybe a two-year setback and
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
let them adopt rules
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
to go up to a five-year setback Maybe
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
something that would be better I don't
 
01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
something that would be better I don't
know

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
um but I do believe that we have never
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
mandated Des to study this issue and to
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
look at it and see what they are lacking
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
in rules we do know that New Hampshire
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
statute and I could be wrong or is it in
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
rules that we do require a double liner
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
for all our our systems now which is a
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
huge difference in some other states I'm
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
not sure that in listening to testimony
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
that Maine even required a double line
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
or system in their statute where we do
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
we have been I believe proactive in
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
addressing these situations we are
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
proactive in addressing our pfas issues
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
we have been taking steps in New
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to mitigate
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the contamination we are a tourism state
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's Des is in vested in
 
01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.490 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's Des is in vested in
maintaining

01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
that and making sure that we have don't
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
have incidences in New Hampshire that
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
would jeopardize that
 
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and I would just ask the director if
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
a two-year setback would be better or if
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
we just allow them to do the study and
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
get it in you know look at the rules and
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
see where we're better than other states
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
and where we're lacking from other
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
states but I think we need to recognize
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
that there are differences and why some
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
states have a five-year setback and they
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the double line requirement
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
of a double liner system
 
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
in place and I don't know if they all
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
have the hydrogeological
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
testing in place study that has to be
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
done prior to us citing a landfill and
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
knowing that a landfill process takes
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
minimum if I'm correct at least two
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
years if not longer just to get one
 
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.010 align:start position:0%
years if not longer just to get one
cited

01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
cited
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
is pretty intense
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so I do believe study is the way to
 
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
go but if you could just address the
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
question about a two-year setback and
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
um yes I I don't know the answer I don't
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
know whether five years or four years or
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
two years is the right number
 
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that you you make the point
 
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.010 align:start position:0%
um I think that you you make the point
that

01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
to date we've not been directed
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically to announce to analyze and
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
evaluate this this particular question
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know there are other
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
ideas in play in the legislature right
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
now that would have us do that and we
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
are we're eager to do that actually we
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
think that's it's clearly important to a
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
lot of people that we we do we do an
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
evaluation like that we do feel like we
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
need some outside assistance in
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing not only our own rules but
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
those of other states
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and I will note that that yes
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
um you know the it's easy to look at
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
another state and just try to compare
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
apples to apples but in fact may you
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to throw any shade on
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
my main colleagues I work with them and
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
know them and like them a lot
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
um or their rules but but it is true
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
that you know that one of the
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
um things that you can do to reduce the
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
travel distance in Maine is to put a
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
double liner in and that for us seems
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
absurd because we already have a double
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
liner requirement in our rules so things
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
are not Apples to Apples and also
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the the
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
um the rules that have been referenced
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
in Maine do provide a number of
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for variances against all
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
of these requirements and
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't honestly know what the
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
history is in this in the siding or
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
expansion of landfills in Maine how
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
often those variances have been granted
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that our staff
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking with some colleagues in Maine
 
01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.219 align:start position:0%
that that there are a number of
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
variances that have been issued for
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
certain requirements so and understand
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
as well that that the the RSA 149m if
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
you put specific requirements in the
 
01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.010 align:start position:0%
you put specific requirements in the
statute

01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:28.790 align:start position:0%
statute
um

01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:30.649 --> 01:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's any specific
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
provision for waiving you you can't wave
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
a statutory number basically if you
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
there may be you could put in Provisions
 
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
that say these particular things can be
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
subject to a waiver we don't use the
 
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
term variance but it could be subject to
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
a waiver and there are Provisions in our
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
rules for granting waivers but
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
you need to know that that specific
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
requirement is subject to or eligible
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
for a waiver if it's appropriate
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes so um
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
I was the the description of the
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
um waivers or variances I think they're
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
called project Improvement allowances in
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
the in the bill but
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
with respect no sir that's not what I'm
 
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:16.820 align:start position:0%
referring to the the the the the
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
variance is is getting is is a concept
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
of getting a specific provision of the
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
rule in their case
 
01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:27.410 align:start position:0%
rule in their case
um

01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
being able to not observe it not not
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
being required to comply with it
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.050 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
so if uh which is which is different
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
from the from what a from a project
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowance okay
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.490 align:start position:0%
um and uh
so

01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.290 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
are there as
 
01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
are there as
if

01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
if we wrote this to allow a certain
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
amount of variance would that give you
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
the leeway to uh to do that so for
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
instance uh if we set it at a five-year
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
distance distance of travel but uh uh
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
but uh the department has the capacity
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
to make variances but not reduce it to
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
say less than two years would that uh
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
that would that Empower you were to make
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
appropriate variances it was under the
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
impression that that is what is
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
envisioned by this is that right well
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
you just said the project project allow
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
the project improvements allowances were
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
not the same thing as variances so if
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm saying if if we made rather
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
than phrasing it as project Improvement
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
allowances if we said you had the uh the
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
capacity to make variances then uh with
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not sure how to answer that
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
question in the department you know we
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
take the legislature's directives very
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
seriously and so
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
um once they're laid down we we do our
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
very best to craft rules that that are
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
consistent with those requirements and
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
then to implement them consistently if
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
if if General language is saying
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
you can give a waiver to these
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
requirements but that's not helpful to
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
us it's like well what what are the
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
provisions for granting a waiver what
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
are the conditions under which a waiver
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
is appropriate so
 
01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
is appropriate so
um

01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess you know it depends where
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
we land on this but at the end of the
 
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
day if there's a requirement that
 
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's a five-year time travel distance
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
setback and that project Improvement
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
allowances could offset up to of a
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
certain description could offset up to
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
two years of that then that could be
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
implemented without specifically looking
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
at or considering any waivers if you're
 
01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.450 align:start position:0%
at or considering any waivers if you're
asking

01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
whether it would be helpful for
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
the department to have the authority to
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
Grant a waiver to Pro to to provide an
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
even lesser distance I guess I don't
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
really understand that because what's
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
the point in having the requirement if
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
you if you can offset five to three and
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
then you can give a waiver to get down
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
right variance to get down to one I'm
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm trying to quite so I
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
don't I I am not uh fully versed in the
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
way that rules and variances and uh
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
project Improvement allowances all are
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
you know I don't necessarily know how
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
those work so what I'm trying to do is
 
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
um oh you know how we would need to
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
write this legislation in order for your
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
department to find it uh sufficiently
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
directive but uh possibly also give you
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
enough uh
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh leeway so that given the specifics of
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
a project you would be able to make
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
judgments based on information that we
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
don't have while we're sitting right
 
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:08.450 align:start position:0%
don't have while we're sitting right
here

01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
I think what I would say is that the
 
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.890 align:start position:0%
I think what I would say is that the
department

01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:11.900 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
feels that a directive to
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
embark on rulemaking using hydrogeologic
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
principles and standards of protection
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
as a description for the guide the
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
development of those rules that's the
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
best we think that's the best assignment
 
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
for us to do this effectively and uh
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:35.659 align:start position:0%
if we were to put a specific minimum
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
time to travel distance in would that be
 
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.810 align:start position:0%
time to travel distance in would that be
problematic

01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
again this we don't know you know one of
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
the things that is is has got the
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
department concerned about some of these
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
bills is that the idea of establishing a
 
01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.290 align:start position:0%
bills is that the idea of establishing a
specific

01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
travel time distance
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
without knowing the specifics of
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
specific sites it's hard to know what
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
that does to the the prospects of citing
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
any landfill anywhere that that's really
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to and we're not
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying that it eliminates all the sites
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
we just simply don't know and so for us
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
to come in and say sure impose a
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
five-year travel distance
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
we think that would be responsible the
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
department to say that if that means
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
that there's actually when you look at
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
all the other citing criteria that apply
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
to a landfill if that means that there's
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
no land anywhere in the state that could
 
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
conceivably have a landfill of any size
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
that that would we think that's
 
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
irresponsible for us to testify in that
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
way on the bill and so what we want to
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
do is we want to you know that that's
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
that will be part of our analysis trying
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
to look at to the extent we can
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
um try to look at you know what what are
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
the impacts of setting a specific time
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
of travel and a distance associated with
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
that with landfill siding we think
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's part of the analysis but we think
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
to we're not prepared because we just
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't know to tell you yes it's
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to establish a five-year
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
time of travel distance or it should be
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
two years we just don't know the answer
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:08.810 align:start position:0%
to that
representative

01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
Murray is this further Among Us
 
01:38:11.639 --> 01:38:12.290 align:start position:0%
Murray is this further Among Us
um

01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we are
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
protecting perennial bodies of water so
 
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
we are asking for rivers and streams and
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
Coastal Waters to be protected with that
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
time to travel five-year setback in the
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
event that there is a failure if not
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
if when as as noted in the US EPA that
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
landfills liners do leak over time so I
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
I I I maintain that uh The house's
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
position this year is no different from
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago in the sense that we felt
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
very strongly that protecting our
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
perennial bodies of water in a
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
measurable way that used science first
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
was the way we needed to be proceeding
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure that landfill citing was
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
done in a way that protected those
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
perennial bodies of water
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
um I think of the two bills HB 56 is the
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
stronger one but I have a question
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the long-term goal of
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislation like this we've heard in
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
testimony that Massachusetts Connecticut
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
and Vermont have placed moratoriums on
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
permitting landfills and I'm just
 
01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
wondering possibly to you uh
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Mari what is the
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
long-term goal of legislation like this
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair May answer the
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
question okay thank
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
you um so
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
so to your point representative coulon I
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is not stating that we should be
 
01:39:48.770 --> 01:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
setting a moratorium though I hear of
 
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
you with what you're saying with respect
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
to our neighbors I what we are seeking
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
to do here is protect water right
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
because once once our water is is
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
contaminated that's it we don't it takes
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
an extreme amount I appreciate that
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
there are methods to clean it up we'd
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have to go there in the
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
first place
 
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.510 align:start position:0%
first place
foreign

01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.990 align:start position:0%
foreign
Howard

01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
um this is a question for representative
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
Murray um is this is this bill uh
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
limited only to protecting water because
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I liked about 602
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
was that it also protects residents why
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
um uh having limitations about how near
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
it can be to be a public roads property
 
01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
boundaries and Residences
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray you may
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
respond thank you madam chair
 
01:40:37.679 --> 01:40:38.870 align:start position:0%
respond thank you madam chair
um

01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
to your point representative Howard I I
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the representative in
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
602 but I I understand that there are
 
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
other areas as well that you you find
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
appreciable in the language around other
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
types of uh you know roads and uh but
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to 56 if we could have that
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
dialogue and I I'm just curious as to
 
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.030 align:start position:0%
dialogue and I I'm just curious as to
what

01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
what you find appealing about those
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
things I I know that those were set
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
forth in maybe some rule making in other
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
states and so I'm curious
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
um there aren't a whole lot of
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
definitions either so we I think that
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
that was something we heard in testimony
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
that we were seeking further
 
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
clarification on like what unstable
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
soils meant or like those types of
 
01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.530 align:start position:0%
soils meant or like those types of
things

01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:29.540 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
a follow-up show
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I think I it's actually explicit in
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
the the bill that we were given on 602
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
that uh that these are were specific
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
setbacks they had you know footage uh
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
set back and I I guess
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
um I guess I could just have a yes or no
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
question should we be considering
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
um impact on humans on residents as much
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
as we are on the water
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you may respond
 
01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.010 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you may respond
yeah

01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no look I there are certain
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
water is a human health concern having
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
potable drinkable water I also know that
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
when there are certain uh
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
when landfills are cited or any anything
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
else is cited there are many instances
 
01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
in which uh there are other types of of
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
zoning regulation or laws that have to
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
be put in place around those other types
 
01:42:26.169 --> 01:42:26.179 align:start position:0%
of things like roads and bridges and
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
easements for power line traversing and
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
things like that so there's a lot that
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
goes into it and I so I'm I I hear you
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
on what you're saying um
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you very
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair are there a couple of
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
points thinking about the testimony and
 
01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
some some excellent points been raised
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
by uh folks on the committee that I'd
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
like to address one is that the when we
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
talk about the liners and we have the
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
double liner system I agree with many of
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
the points that representative has made
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
I would however point out that uh
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the whether we have
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
one-liners or two as opposed to the the
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
time uh that it would take
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
um a spill or seepage to get to a water
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
source they're not exactly the same
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
thing right the purpose of the liner is
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent the leak we're talking about
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
once a leak has occurred right so the
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
double liner means a leak is less likely
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't necessarily have an
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
impact on the setback distance once a
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
leak has occurred the other point that I
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
would make regarding the relationship
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
between whether it's a minimum of 200
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
feet again I appreciate that
 
01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
feet again I appreciate that
clarification

01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
ultimately distance is a function of
 
01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
ultimately distance is a function of
time

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
right the reason why we establish at
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
least 200 feet
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
is to say that our expectation is that
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
giving us that setback means that we
 
01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
have time to react once a leak happens
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
so in that case distance as far as I'm
 
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
concerned is merely a measure of time
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
and so what we should really be
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about here in in determining
 
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
its statute and Rule is time how much
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
time do we have from the time a leak
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
occurs to the time it reaches a body of
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
water in distance in this case which
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
we've had in statute for 30 years is
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
simply a substitute for time as far as I
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
can tell so I think time however we
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
determine that appropriate time is the
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
appropriate measurement for how far a
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
setback should be thank you
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am sure just just a couple of
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts and and first of all I agree
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
completely that the intent intention of
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
this discussion is is absolutely On
 
01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:38.450 align:start position:0%
this discussion is is absolutely On
Target

01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
Target
 
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
which is how do we
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
um protect our Waters
 
01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:46.580 align:start position:0%
um but listening to to testimony
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
today and uh and last week from some
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
folks that are much more qualified than
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
my 40 year old environmental engineering
 
01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.770 align:start position:0%
my 40 year old environmental engineering
degree

01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that that the velocity is
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
also part of that so it's not just
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
distance and time it's
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
the soil analysis and how fat and how
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
fast it moves through
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that that anything that we
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
look at that sets a standard
 
01:45:14.639 --> 01:45:16.010 align:start position:0%
look at that sets a standard
uh

01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of time distance
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
in statute I think is premature
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh I would much rather have someone with
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
much more experience than than I've got
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
make that determination recognize it
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry one recognizing that for
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
each site the soil the amount of water
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
the movement is completely different
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and so I I guess in in representative
 
01:45:44.810 --> 01:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
Murray and I talked about it this
 
01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.609 align:start position:0%
Murray and I talked about it this
morning

01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
um the the one thing that that she said
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
not that it's the only thing but the one
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
thing she said is one that really
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
resonated with me is
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
um okay put a moratorium of two years
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
say don't do this until we really sort
 
01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:01.139 align:start position:0%
ourselves out and figure out what the
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
right way to do it is but I I do think
 
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
that as the testimony this morning with
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
it that they're interested in figuring
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
that out and that What legislation we've
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
got should
 
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
enable them to do that and and put an
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
accountability forcing function into
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
that and I'm sorry I got more hands
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
after what I said before we started it's
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
not on the bus help or not
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative dutzie
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
um in reviewing
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
um the testimony that we received uh at
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
the last public hearing one of the
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
things that uh cropped up with me is
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
that it basically is
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
um you know one side uh it's the expert
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
testimony that you would see
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
um at a jury trial so for every
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist that says this is
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
arbitrary you have another
 
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist and I will just quote
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
from this H uh House Bill 56 addresses
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
the current completely inadequate
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and potentially dangerous
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
landfill set-back criteria of 200 feet
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
from surface water in two very important
 
01:47:13.209 --> 01:47:13.219 align:start position:0%
Hydro geological ways and this is from a
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist so you know one two
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
points that I want to make first of all
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
the bill that we have before us was
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
worked and reworked and reworked by many
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who are hydrogeologists and this
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
is what they came up with
 
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know so I don't want people to think
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
that this bill was just taken out of
 
01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
thin air I mean we all real all remember
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
how how hard representative Tucker
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
worked to get a bill that could be
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
passed it was also my understanding that
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
we had buy-in on that bill from New
 
01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:56.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire des
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the house and the Senate okay we
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
didn't have it from from the governor so
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think we need to take that in
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
consideration I don't see how
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
kicking this can down the road and
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
having a study done by one
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist is going to rectify the
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
issue that we have I think the situation
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
is is apparently either the science is
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
not there or the scientists cannot agree
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
on the science that is there so doing a
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
study by one company that is chosen
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
through an RFP by the New Hampshire Des
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
is I don't think I mean you'll get an
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
answer but I don't know if you're going
 
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
to get the right answer because we can't
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
even come up with the right answer here
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Contour you had your hand
 
01:48:51.649 --> 01:48:51.659 align:start position:0%
up I did Madam chair and thank you very
 
01:48:51.659 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
up I did Madam chair and thank you very
much

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to make a statement and Des
 
01:48:57.890 --> 01:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
can correct me if I'm wrong but I do
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
every city town and municipality in the
 
01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:05.699 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with the
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
exception of one has a body of water in
 
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.410 align:start position:0%
exception of one has a body of water in
it

01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a comment about uh what
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
bill we are considering or what bills
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're considering today and what is out
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
there so
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
we heard Reference last week that there
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
is a bill that is coming through the
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
Senate that is proposing a study
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
committee or is proposing that a method
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
of study uh that Des would undertake
 
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:46.820 align:start position:0%
with a um with a contractor
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
and that is a Senate bill
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
and uh it is uh it was recommended
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
positively out of committee there it is
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
likely that we'll we will be seeing that
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
at some point over crossover we can make
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
our assessment about that study can that
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
study bill to when the Senate Bill comes
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
to us uh as the as a Senate bill that we
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
are doing the the second pass on uh so
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
what we have before us is two house
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
bills both of which use the basic idea
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
of determining a time to travel
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
measurement uh distance to travel
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
measurement which would give us a
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
certain amount of uh give a give a
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
certain amount of land of time buffer
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
around the landfill uh should there be a
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
spill and uh so there are some uh
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
differences between the two bills that
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
we have before us one of them relies
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
very heavily on on the rules from the
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
state of Maine and uh there are um
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out in testimony uh there
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
are some definitions that are absent
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
from it that might be necessary in order
 
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
to make it workable uh and uh it is also
 
01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:13.729 align:start position:0%
to make it workable uh and uh it is also
um

01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:17.540 align:start position:0%
it was it is construct that the the main
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
rules that is based on are constructed
 
01:51:23.689 --> 01:51:23.699 align:start position:0%
within Maine statute and that is
 
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
something that is not necessarily
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
um parallel or
 
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:30.860 align:start position:0%
um or uh
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily work in the same
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
way that New Hampshire statute does so
 
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.890 align:start position:0%
way that New Hampshire statute does so
uh

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
putting main rules in New Hampshire
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
statute could create conflicts that are
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
that we we can't see without looking at
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
the whole body of main law and the whole
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
body of New Hampshire law right now uh
 
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that uh that uh are
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
focused mostly be on HB 56 and
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
we determine whether or not uh a is an
 
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:07.100 align:start position:0%
approach that is
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to use right now uh
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
and B whether there are further
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendments that need to be made Beyond
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment that representative
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Murray brought to us which I think uh
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of the grandfather
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
section I think is really critical
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby would you suggest
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
then that um
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
hb602bitled and that we further work on
 
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
HB 56 for an amendment for next week I
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
would actually propose that we retain
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
602 because I think that uh we're not
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clear what's going to happen
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
down the road and we might need that as
 
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for further legislation it
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
costs nothing for us to retain it at
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
this point and then if we need it in the
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
fall we we can use it if we don't need
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
it in the fall we can then recommend itl
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts on that from our
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to agree with
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and to
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard's point I think
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
that 602 probably had some numbers in it
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
that were valid and came from someplace
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that the people who
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
were testifying on behalf of that Bill
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
had the answers to it so I I'm curious
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
as to where the numbers came from and so
 
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
I just think it'll be it would be nice
 
01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
um retained so that if we decide that
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more protection for a
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
Landover landowner nearby or around
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
roads we could further investigate that
 
01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.609 align:start position:0%
roads we could further investigate that
representative

01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually in favor of italing 602
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we will have the
 
01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.010 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we will have the
time

01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
to look at what parts of 602 are in
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
statute and which part of the minimum
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
rules and how they uh conflict with New
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe that if I know that there
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
may be other bills coming from the
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that could be retained I
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
any other comments on
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh one of the things about or
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
um actually any bill that comes to us is
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
that we have the capacity to change it
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
substantially we don't need other than
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that the topic of the bill is
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
solid is landfill citing
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
we have a broad authority to put
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
whatever we want in there in play in
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
including replacing the entire Bill uh
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
by saying that we're keeping it as a
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle I'm not suggesting that we net
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
we actually keep any of the the content
 
01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
of it beyond the fact that it's about
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
Wentzville Society
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.910 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
I did have
 
01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.649 align:start position:0%
I did have
um

01:55:23.649 --> 01:55:23.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
there was there was a a line in hb602
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
which I thought was
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
um something that I wanted to discuss
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
with the committee uh possibly adding
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
that into
 
01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
um HB 56 and that is on page two which
 
01:55:46.729 --> 01:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
line three that says the area within the
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
solid waste boundary shall not lie over
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
or be within 300 feet of a significant
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
Sand and Gravel aquifier
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
um aquifer what what are people's
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that particular
 
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.169 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that particular
issue

01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't be opposed to I mean when
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um
 
01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:14.219 align:start position:0%
the fact that aquifers are diff I mean
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
aquifers are below ground whereas what
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
we were talking about is perennial
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
bodies of water through groundwater
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
um flow I wouldn't be opposed to that I
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
would also say that I thought that um
 
01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
one of the other Lines within the bill
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
that had some Merit was talking about
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
um wildlife habitat areas
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
um so those were the two areas that I
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
thought were
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
um of note
 
01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bixby
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I would agree that that it
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to make sure that we don't
 
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
put a landfill on top of a or or close
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
to sand and gravel aquifer I'd like to
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
direct a question to director wimsat as
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
to whether there is currently any
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in state law in terms of
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
putting a landfill
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill within that distance
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:57:14.219 --> 01:57:19.010 align:start position:0%
of a
aquifer

01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes um there there
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
are Provisions in the law or in rule
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
limit the sighting of a landfill over
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
and and I apologize I don't have the
 
01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
specific site so I'm not going to try to
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
describe it with Precision but basically
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
for a significant
 
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
um aquifer and drinking water source
 
01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:41.420 align:start position:0%
there are specific setbacks um or
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
specific Provisions that that limit
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill you know within a
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
certain distance of that or or really I
 
01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
don't even know that it's a numerical
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
distance it's probably more and I will
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
get this for you but I think it's more
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
General language about that it can't
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
have an impact on a significant I'm
 
01:58:01.729 --> 01:58:01.739 align:start position:0%
drinking water aquifer
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:08.219 align:start position:0%
would a so would all sand and gravel
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
aquifers be considered drinking water
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
Aqua first
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't no the the answer is no
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's a specific
 
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:18.950 align:start position:0%
it's a specific
um

01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
level of or a significance of a
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
particular aquifer keep in mind that
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
there are sand and gravel deposits
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
nearly everywhere in New Hampshire or
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
varying degrees in size and any one of
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
them is is very likely capable of
 
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
providing adequate water for a residence
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's always a
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
question of yield and sustainability you
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
know so all aquifers are clearly not
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
created equal and it's one of the
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
frustrations that geologists have in New
 
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when people talk about oh well
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's over an aquifer and of course the
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
reality is almost everything in New
 
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all the overburdened deposits
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
are or could be described as an aquifer
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's just a question of how much water
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
and of what quality and what what
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
capacity and yield could that aquifer
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
provide drinking water
 
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
so um but but there is currently in in
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
law or in rules
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
um a Prohibition of essentially putting
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
a uh landfill over an aquifer right
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
again what I will be happy to do if it's
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
helpful is I will get an answer in more
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
or less real time here about what the
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
what the rule actually says I just don't
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
have a memory I think maybe someone back
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
here has it
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure I was going to ask if and you are
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
as you were talking I just sort of
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
looked up the existing rules and I'd
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
like to read to the committee if I may
 
01:59:48.609 --> 01:59:48.619 align:start position:0%
this is from
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
envsw802 groundwater protection
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
standards it's a subsection of the
 
01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:54.380 align:start position:0%
citing rules as they exist today
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
subsection a reads a landfill shall not
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
be cited within the Wellhead protection
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%

subsection
 
02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:11.570 align:start position:0%
subsection
um

02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
C reads identification of the areas
 
02:00:16.850 --> 02:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
cited above shall be based on a
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic investigation which
 
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
provides all site-specific information
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
required to model the pre-construction
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
and post-construction groundwater and
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
surface water regimen
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
as a hydrogeologist those are the two
 
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
sections I'd refer to in terms of
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
specifically applying to what would be
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel or water supply well
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
aquifers and I'll defer back to the
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the rest of the context
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
but I'll stay here in case you need
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
another section thank you for that I
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate that clarification for the
 
02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.490 align:start position:0%
appreciate that clarification for the
committee

02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:52.209 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:52.209 --> 02:00:52.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
so so representative Bixby um So based
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that uh that it would be
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to put that uh
 
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.189 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to put that uh
specific

02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
um language into this bill but what's
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
your feeling on that no I agree
 
02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
um but then that leads me to some
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
concern though
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
since we as a committee are not familiar
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
with what all of the rules are
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
indeed what Des the rules are that they
 
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:28.139 align:start position:0%
operate Within
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
it it brings me some hesitation as to
 
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:33.950 align:start position:0%
it it brings me some hesitation as to
our

02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.770 align:start position:0%
our
um

02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill that we are looking
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
at now with HB 56 because are there some
 
02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill that
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
um supersede or interfere with what we
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I I am cognizant of uh our
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
concern over the minimum 200 foot
 
02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
concern over the minimum 200 foot
setback

02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
setback
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not a fan of that at all
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not familiar with what the
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
rest of the rules are that Des uses in
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
citing landfills
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes so I think that
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that so the in
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:23.810 align:start position:0%
terms of the
um

02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
levels of uh priority so essentially we
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
as legislators deal with statute which
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
sets out the principles that we want to
 
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
be enacted we don't need to look at
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
every single uh you know detail of how
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
those are are enacted but
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
um I I look at the idea of
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
requiring a uh sufficient time to deal
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
with a leak or a spill as being a matter
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
of principle
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
and uh in terms and that is something
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would make sense for us to say okay
 
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is something that needs to be taken
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
into account whenever you're making
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
rules you can't you can't allow a
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
permitting if there is not this
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
um this distance the safety distance
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
that is determined by hydrogeology and
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh by calculation uh and so I I see that
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
as a matter of principle uh in terms of
 
02:03:33.599 --> 02:03:34.310 align:start position:0%
as a matter of principle uh in terms of
um

02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
how that affects the other rules uh if
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are rules that are not sufficient
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
to meet that well that's a principle
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've laid out and the rules need to be
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
adjusted if there are if there are rules
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
if the rules meet that then good
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
Point well taken
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
chair I you know I I do uh to piggyback
 
02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
on what representative Bixby had
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I want to make sure that
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're considering
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
the vision and the intent like
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said we have seen
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
before this committee several instances
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
and where like just like Coakley
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
landfill for example that is a super fun
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
site that has has has complexities and
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
problems now that have existed and are
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
still in the cleanup process and it
 
02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
hasn't been fully completed I never want
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
to get there again and I think that by
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
having Clarity in what we are asking for
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
here is a step in the right direction to
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
put this in statute
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
chair in in
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
um to sort of piggyback on what you said
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
about the aquifier
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
um this may reflect an incomplete
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
understanding of the rule how
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
legislature affects rules but um it
 
02:04:54.729 --> 02:04:54.739 align:start position:0%
seems like this uh um legislation
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
changes rules it seems from what I
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
understand it seems like the the Des is
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to be looking sort of creating a
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
new set of rules in response to this uh
 
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
this bill this legislation and um if we
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
if they are taking a new look shouldn't
 
02:05:13.689 --> 02:05:13.699 align:start position:0%
they also be looking at the aquifier
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we put a trigger in there that
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
they include amplifiers in their new set
 
02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
of rules even if they already have
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative Bixby
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh so our rulemaking is
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
um a fairly complex and time-consuming
 
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.390 align:start position:0%
um a fairly complex and time-consuming
operation

02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
operation
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I I don't want to uh just have a
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
handful of things that we say Des needs
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
to look at rules on this this and this I
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
if unless they are
 
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.430 align:start position:0%
if unless they are
um

02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh unless there is clear evidence that
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
it is not being taken to an into an
 
02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:03.179 align:start position:0%
account right now uh the with with the
 
02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:06.260 align:start position:0%
distance uh with the setback distance
 
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that there's a minimum of
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
200 feet uh says that that's something
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
that is that does not conform with our
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
principle that there needs to be uh
 
02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
enough time to deal with it
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of the uh the aqua
 
02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
citing related to aquifers it sounds
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
like there is currently an appropriate
 
02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
an appropriate approach in uh rules uh
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
to deal with aquifers now uh the uh
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
there is the Senate bill which we'll be
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
able to look at later that is suggesting
 
02:06:46.129 --> 02:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
a study it might be a good idea to just
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
do a study an overall study of the rules
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
as well as having a specific principle
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
of how much time you need to in order to
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
respond but
 
02:06:59.810 --> 02:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and that and that might be a place to
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
look at uh these other things but I
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that in terms of focus the focus
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill we really need to just
 
02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:07.820 align:start position:0%
focus focus on that setback distance
 
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
so in listening to the testimony and
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
understanding The Five-Year setback
 
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and listening to the director and Des
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
if we implement this bill we're tying
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
their hands and we're putting in statute
 
02:07:29.390 --> 02:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
this five-year setback that when we have
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
if we they go on to have the study done
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
02:07:39.609 --> 02:07:39.619 align:start position:0%
I mean we would have to undo legislation
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
in order for them to make the best
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations if this is not
 
02:07:45.239 --> 02:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
recommendations if this is not
appropriate

02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
and my question is is we don't know what
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
is appropriate we are saying that a
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
five-year setback is appropriate if we
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
pass this bill but nobody knows nobody
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
can answer that question honestly in the
 
02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have had
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
differing views some say yes some say no
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
and until we get an assessment and a
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
study an in-depth study to study this
 
02:08:10.679 --> 02:08:11.629 align:start position:0%
study an in-depth study to study this
issue

02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think that proposing any legislation
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.530 --> 02:08:20.540 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that we already
 
02:08:25.250 --> 02:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
have legislation in place
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
which many hydrogeologists feel is
 
02:08:33.169 --> 02:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and not based on scientific
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
evidence we also have in our manual a
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
letter dated February 21st from the New
 
02:08:43.870 --> 02:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des Robert Scott commissioner
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
which you know I look at some of the
 
02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
concerns that he has I mean there seems
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be three major concerns that that he
 
02:08:56.209 --> 02:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
has one you know states that the travel
 
02:08:58.850 --> 02:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
time is arbitrary well the 200 minimum
 
02:09:02.689 --> 02:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
setback is is arbitrary none of them are
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know seem to be deal breakers in my
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
opinion if New Hampshire Des really had
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
major concerns about this bill then why
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
do we only have one sheet of paper
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
from the director from the the
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the agency
 
02:09:25.089 --> 02:09:25.099 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and I will say again
 
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
involved in this legislation and I think
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
we are trying everything that we do with
 
02:09:41.689 --> 02:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
this will be arbitrary it's already
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
arbitrary okay should we wait another
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
two years and allow these arbitrary
 
02:09:51.370 --> 02:09:51.380 align:start position:0%
rules that are in place now to dictate
 
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh where we cite landfills I mean I
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
think we have to think about this
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to concur with
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh dutzie and that we
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
have I like the analogy of you know if
 
02:10:08.089 --> 02:10:08.099 align:start position:0%
we were in a courtroom and we had expert
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and we have expert Witnesses
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
telling us one thing and then we have
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
another set of expert Witnesses telling
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
us something else and if we conduct this
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
study uh that we're talking about the
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of then we have another set
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
of expert Witnesses and their testimony
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
in conflict with some of the other
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
evidence that we've heard right in which
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
case we say well which of these sets of
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
experts are we going to listen to I
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
think that the The Five-Year setback is
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
a statement on behalf of the house about
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
how much time we think at a minimum is
 
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
important for us to be able to
 
02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.570 align:start position:0%
important for us to be able to
prevent

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
the possibility of a significant source
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
of pollution in our water system so I I
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't see the idea of having another
 
02:10:54.609 --> 02:10:54.619 align:start position:0%
study with another set of
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists is somehow it's going to
 
02:10:57.119 --> 02:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists is somehow it's going to
be

02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the definitive answer any more than
 
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we've heard so far in
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
the five-year period as I said is a
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
statement about our commitment to making
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't happen in the
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
future thank you representative Haskins
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
out of respect for all the work that's
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
gone into this bill
 
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
and with reference to representative
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
Dusty's comments if I'm going to get a
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
vote and make a decision I'm going to
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
err on the side of protection not the
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
other side
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
02:11:32.209 --> 02:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
I took in car with thank you to concur
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
with representative Haskins I mean you
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
have to look at the consequences here
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
the consequences we heard a lot of
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
testimony about monitoring and
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
mitigation but when the cat's out of the
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
bag it's out of the bag when the pfas is
 
02:11:44.089 --> 02:11:44.099 align:start position:0%
leaked when these chemicals have leaked
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
you can't just put them back the
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
mediation remediation doesn't you know
 
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's if you've ever been involved in
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
remediation it's a tremendous amount of
 
02:11:52.729 --> 02:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
work we have pfas in our town you can't
 
02:11:54.649 --> 02:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the pfas you can't just
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
put it back in the flame retardant it's
 
02:11:58.609 --> 02:11:58.619 align:start position:0%
very very arduous and expensive to do
 
02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
cleanup so knowing that you've had a
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
leak only tells you that you've had a
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
leak you know it doesn't protect the
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
water it doesn't stop the leak you just
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
have that information so I I feel like
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
the consequences to a leak are so high
 
02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
that the bar to protection has to be
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
equally high so thank you representative
 
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Venom Taran I think
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the uh one point that we might in
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
addition to the public health concerns
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the public safety concerns I I think
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon us to not forget
 
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
that um we have a large tourism industry
 
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
of folks who rely on outdoor recreation
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
and they come to New Hampshire to enjoy
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
the outdoors particularly in in
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
communities all across from the Seacoast
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the up north
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and I want to make sure that we are
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
keeping New Hampshire as pristine as
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
possible to make sure that we have the
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to attract folks to
 
02:12:52.129 --> 02:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
come here and play here and want to stay
 
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
here and I think that that's important
 
02:12:58.129 --> 02:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm I agree with everything you're
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
saying that just another take on it
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh any landfill that's in the state
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
today is in the state
 
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
there are no landfills being considered
 
02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
as as perted testimony
 
02:13:16.129 --> 02:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
so by saying
 
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
put it put it to your moratorium on it
 
02:13:21.169 --> 02:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
don't rush to failure
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
figure out we'll figure out what the
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
right answer is we're not making
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything worse
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's no landfill going in we put a
 
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
moratorium on it and you're not making
 
02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
it any worse you're not creating
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
anything new
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
all you're doing is continuing to clean
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
up whatever we screwed up already and
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
then figuring out how the new stuff goes
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
in in a more appropriate way so that it
 
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
prevents those things that you're
 
02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:44.900 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's sort of my my take on it
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
02:13:54.770 --> 02:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
to your point you know I don't I think
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said that you know
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
I think that what we were discussing is
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
that there is something in works on the
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the body that's coming
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
through that make makes mention to this
 
02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:06.350 align:start position:0%
through that make makes mention to this
uh

02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:07.729 align:start position:0%
uh
potential

02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:14:12.169 --> 02:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and so to that end you know
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
either one has to supersede one another
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think our responsibility here in the
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
house is to make sure that we are
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
continuing to do our uh what we were
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
charged to do and this is a response to
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative vote
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
um I think everything that's been said
 
02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
here is absolutely valid but I want to
 
02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
back up what representative Haskins has
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
said very specifically and I can tell
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
you when I go for my morning Jog and
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
when I go downtown Portsmouth for my
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
morning coffee
 
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
so many residents and people within my
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
district say what is being done about
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
pfas what is being done about the issues
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
that we have continually discussed as a
 
02:14:59.639 --> 02:15:00.649 align:start position:0%
that we have continually discussed as a
community

02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
and continually as a state and it and it
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
kind of pulls at me every single time
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
when I have to look at them and say
 
02:15:10.609 --> 02:15:10.619 align:start position:0%
nothing or we're we're going through
 
02:15:12.290 --> 02:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
these different processes in order to
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
determine what the best steps are
 
02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire and the
 
02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
people specifically on the Seacoast that
 
02:15:19.729 --> 02:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
I talk to are looking for answers
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
they're looking for us to take those
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
next steps to say what mitigation
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
methods and which ways are you going
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
about to solve these issues
 
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
and it's hard when I'm sitting there
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
with my mocha and every time I'm trying
 
02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
to tell our residents you know well
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're still in the process of doing that
 
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
or I don't have answers for you
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I think now is the time to take those
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
steps forward to put the protections
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
into place and to finally say and have
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
our opportunity to go back to our
 
02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
constituents and say we're taking the
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
necessary steps we're doing what you
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
have asked us to do it's time to protect
 
02:15:59.410 --> 02:15:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I agree with
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray but I'm just
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
curious if we do put a two-year
 
02:16:11.810 --> 02:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
moratorium on this
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
what what do we do with that trash in
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
between then I know Cadbury has a very
 
02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
specific plan that that cannot take it
 
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know about Rochester I can't
 
02:16:24.890 --> 02:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
speak for them but I'm just wondering
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
representing Bixby
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:16:33.179 --> 02:16:34.190 align:start position:0%
yeah so
um

02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
so both
 
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
um both throughout TurnKey in Rochester
 
02:16:43.009 --> 02:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
and uh Mount carvery have
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
um permitted capacity well into the next
 
02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
decade uh and so uh the there's not a
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
there's not a need right the with the
 
02:16:57.530 --> 02:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
two-year moratorium uh there is still
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
um to you know deal with the future of
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
trash in the State uh but a two-year
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium is part of another bill
 
02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:12.260 align:start position:0%
that's coming to us later uh we can do
 
02:17:17.089 --> 02:17:17.099 align:start position:0%
which if we pass HB 56
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't prevent us from passing the
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
other bill as well with that moratorium
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I think is
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
really important uh is that uh
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether you know no matter what the even
 
02:17:36.830 --> 02:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
if we end up having a moratorium and a
 
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
study I think we still need to lay out
 
02:17:41.929 --> 02:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
the principle that there needs to be
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
time to deal with uh a leak or a spill
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
that could threaten nearby water bodies
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
and that principle is something that uh
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
I I think needs to be in place
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
no matter what so uh the uh the study
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
might yield other things that need to be
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh dealt with in order to improve our
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
methods if we get around to doing that
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
study but I think that having a
 
02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
study but I think that having a
clear

02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh time buffer between disaster and the
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
resp and our ability to complete a
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
response to it is really critical
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
to your statement representative Bixby
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
so then
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
that five years is an appropriate time
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
versus some other amount of time three
 
02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
years four years
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh and yes I think that five years is I
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
a uh if we look at other states that
 
02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
have that you know Maine has six
 
02:18:55.129 --> 02:18:55.139 align:start position:0%
um I think New Jersey has 12 uh but uh I
 
02:19:01.129 --> 02:19:01.139 align:start position:0%
think that five is a safe minimum uh and
 
02:19:01.139 --> 02:19:05.169 align:start position:0%
think that five is a safe minimum uh and
uh

02:19:05.169 --> 02:19:05.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
a safe minimum without any further
 
02:19:09.479 --> 02:19:10.629 align:start position:0%
a safe minimum without any further
um

02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:13.929 --> 02:19:13.939 align:start position:0%
uh steps Beyond what's currently in rule
 
02:19:19.009 --> 02:19:19.019 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh the
 
02:19:19.019 --> 02:19:20.089 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh the
um

02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
the what we what the Senate gave us last
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
year in terms of having project
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowances uh being able to
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
reduce that I think that is a place
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
where uh the study might be appropriate
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
might appropriately suggest what those
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowances should be but uh
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
I think that in terms of a principle we
 
02:19:44.929 --> 02:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
enough time to react so
 
02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
given that I mean if we if and I don't
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
want to talk about the Senate bill as
 
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
much but I'll tell you
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
if if we pass this with a five-year
 
02:19:59.939 --> 02:20:01.610 align:start position:0%
if if we pass this with a five-year
setback

02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
setback
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
for want you know water to be traveling
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
underground or leachate to be traveling
 
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.090 align:start position:0%
underground or leachate to be traveling
Underground

02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
Underground
 
02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:09.349 align:start position:0%
Underground
and

02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
we then also did Embark upon some study
 
02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:15.650 align:start position:0%
we then also did Embark upon some study
whereby

02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:16.250 align:start position:0%
whereby
um

02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
they came out with some other
 
02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:19.730 align:start position:0%
they came out with some other
recommendations

02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
I suppose that we could go back and
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
amend this five years to be something
 
02:20:29.050 --> 02:20:29.060 align:start position:0%
that makes more sense based on
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
studies that are done
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
would that be that a consideration
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's entirely correct if if the study
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
if if a study in the future comes back
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
and says you know we need that it makes
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
sense to alter this in a certain way uh
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
we as the legislature have the power to
 
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
um to adjust that I mean we've there are
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
several of our bills in this committee
 
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
earlier have been adjusting things that
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
were in previous statute that no longer
 
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
work and uh that is a that's a constant
 
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
process if uh if the if a department
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
comes back to us and says
 
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
um we have you know in the process of
 
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking we discovered this is it
 
02:21:23.929 --> 02:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
needs needs to be altered then we have
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
the power to do that
 
02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
well you know so just my concern is with
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
going back to what director wimsat said
 
02:21:35.330 --> 02:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
was that you know the law is the law and
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's what they have to follow
 
02:21:40.610 --> 02:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
and if the law is not
 
02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:42.610 align:start position:0%
and if the law is not
um

02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:42.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
benefiting Us in any way uh it can it
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
can go the other way and be you know a
 
02:21:49.380 --> 02:21:50.270 align:start position:0%
can go the other way and be you know a
problem

02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
right so I think that uh
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
this gets back to that idea of principle
 
02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
the principle is that we need time to
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
there needs to be time for re
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
remediation if there's a if there's a
 
02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
disaster and uh the five-year uh amount
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
of time is something that was suggested
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
by someone who has been in uh uh in
 
02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:21.500 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation for a very long time
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
and has dealt with a a number of
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
instances where uh rules weren't
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uh to to carry the full
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
weight and need it and there needed to
 
02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
be statutory back up in order to make
 
02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
sure that those uh that the rules uh
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
really met the needs of uh of
 
02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
environmental remediation so uh it's
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a number that's picked sort of
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
out of thin air it's a number that's
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
that was picked by someone who is has
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
experience in the field who knows what
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
the procedures are for remediation and
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
knows that it's not an immediate process
 
02:23:08.809 --> 02:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
okay representative coulon you had your
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm uh
 
02:23:16.490 --> 02:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah just one point that I wanted to
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
make again to the long-term impacts of
 
02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
the things that we're doing here today I
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
live in a rural area we do not have a
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
transfer station where we live if we
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
make it hard to access Waste Services
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go into a landfold
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to go directly in a water
 
02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
source the end of a dead end Road
 
02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
there's going to be no pond liner
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be no
 
02:23:44.270 --> 02:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological survey or anything like
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
that so I want people to just kind of
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
consider the long-term impacts of the
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing and I think it's
 
02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
important uh long term to realize that
 
02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to have waste
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
Independence we can't be kicking the can
 
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
down the road like the other states that
 
02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
we've considered here like Connecticut
 
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Massachusetts thank you
 
02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just want to refer us to some
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received last time and
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
basically this was a study and it says
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh I hope the committee realizes that
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
all HB 56 would do is make it slightly
 
02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
harder to cite a new landfill in the
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
minority of grossly inappropriate sites
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
that should not even be considered and
 
02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
then they have a chart here which which
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
shows that mount Carberry it would take
 
02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
under HB 56 it would take
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
106 years to travel one mile uh TurnKey
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
it would be nine years
 
02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem depending on how you do it it
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
could be 14 years but the bottom line is
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
is that please also be aware that the
 
02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
majority of the landfills that New
 
02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relies on today would likely
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
have passed the HB 56 test and I think
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
we have to keep that into into
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
consideration we're not asking for
 
02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:13.690 align:start position:0%
consideration we're not asking for
anything

02:25:13.690 --> 02:25:13.700 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
you know that is I think out of you know
 
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
out of the purview of what best
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative datsey given your comment
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
it almost then sounds that the current
 
02:25:31.439 --> 02:25:32.929 align:start position:0%
it almost then sounds that the current
Des

02:25:32.929 --> 02:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
Des
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
rules for citing landfills have worked
 
02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
rules for citing landfills have worked
because

02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
if in it if you're saying that and if
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
this testimony from Mr Finkel says that
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of landfills in that New
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relies on today would likely
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
have passed the HB 56 test based on
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
these the criteria
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
then but it also says that the proposed
 
02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
Granite State landfill
 
02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay would reach the one mile uh test in
 
02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
330 days true but that hasn't been
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
permitted and that has not been cited so
 
02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
well you know right but just saying yeah
 
02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Compton
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.889 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
and

02:26:21.889 --> 02:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony it almost
 
02:26:25.969 --> 02:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're putting the card
 
02:26:28.130 --> 02:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
before the horse
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
currently you're we're talking about
 
02:26:32.929 --> 02:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
there's already a moratorium
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a study
 
02:26:38.270 --> 02:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
if there's already a moratorium why is
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
there a need to rush to legislation
 
02:26:43.969 --> 02:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
okay there is not there is no moratorium
 
02:26:46.849 --> 02:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
no okay just wanted to ask that question
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
just clarifying that okay thank you
 
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
because it was stated then today
 
02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and if I could
 
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh in in response to your
 
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
good question about right you know is it
 
02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
necessary given the testimony that
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy referred to I'd say
 
02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
that the key word to me in that
 
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
statement is majority right and it only
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
takes one or two uh leaks and problems
 
02:27:14.090 --> 02:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
for us to to have a major problem so it
 
02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
may be true that a majority of current
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
landfills would have would have met this
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh these requirements anyway majority I
 
02:27:22.849 --> 02:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
think there's a key word I also want to
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I think that talking
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
about time
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
of travel to a water source is something
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
is a principle that that we should stand
 
02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
on it makes a lot more sense to me uh
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
than distance again I I can maintain the
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
distance is is a function of time uh but
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it is uh if perhaps a
 
02:27:47.090 --> 02:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
director knows the answer to this
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
question or anybody on the committee
 
02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
about how the 200 feet was was
 
02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
determined because we got into this back
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
and forth about what's arbitrary what's
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
not arbitrary I think that we all assume
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
based on our work and the testimony we
 
02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
hear from witnesses that these are not
 
02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
arbitrary numbers they are based upon
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
testimony for example The Five-Year
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
setback but I'm wondering what the 200
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
feet is based on because in the end it's
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
this Committee in this house they're
 
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
committing to a principle right upon
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
which then rules are are based so I'm
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if that 200 feet what the
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
specific scientific evidence was that
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
concluded that uh a minimum of 200 feet
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
was the appropriate setback minimum ah
 
02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Romana I don't
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
know the source of the 200 feet I I
 
02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
would point out again that it's a
 
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
minimum that it's really not it's part
 
02:28:37.130 --> 02:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
of a larger
 
02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:37.849 align:start position:0%
of a larger
um

02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
system that determines what this how
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
landfills are going to be cited and in
 
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
in practice
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I believe there may be some examples
 
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
of I mean I'll give you an example there
 
02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
was a a setback issue
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
um at the at one of our the other
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
landfills that
 
02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:57.849 align:start position:0%
landfills that
um

02:28:57.849 --> 02:28:57.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
was the problem and they actually got a
 
02:29:01.969 --> 02:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
variance from it it was a small Wetland
 
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
area that didn't meet the setback
 
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
the company was within their rights and
 
02:29:10.849 --> 02:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
would have likely gotten a permit to
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
fill the will and the Wetland and
 
02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:15.530 align:start position:0%
fill the will and the Wetland and
basically

02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know then they would have meant
 
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
the setback because the surface water
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
would have been gone but they actually
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
got a a a a waiver from that requirement
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
because they could they had a system
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
where they could actually allow it to uh
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
to to not not fill it but basically
 
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
allow it to continue and it actually
 
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense in the particular in
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
that particular construction project so
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
the the examples of the 200 foot setback
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
really tend to be very small Wetland
 
02:29:45.130 --> 02:29:45.140 align:start position:0%
areas around
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
and there aren't very many of those
 
02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
examples either but in terms of large
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know what we would think of a
 
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
significant surface water a pond or a
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
lake or a river the setbacks are
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
typically much greater not as a result
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
of that 200 foot requirement but as a
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
result of the larger
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
um or the the broader language about
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
protection of surface water quality and
 
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that we can in many cases it
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
has to do with just being able to
 
02:30:13.330 --> 02:30:13.340 align:start position:0%
adequately Monitor and detect a a leak
 
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
and and deal with that I'm in a
 
02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount so so the 200 foot
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
um really is just serving as a minimum I
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
don't know I honestly don't know where
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
it came from originally it's been that
 
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the rules for some time may I follow
 
02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
up better sure you may thank you uh and
 
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
so if if it definitely makes sense to me
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
that in most cases is greater than 200
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
feet but if you determine it should be
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
more than 200 feet my thinking is that
 
02:30:43.130 --> 02:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
what informs that decision is how long
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
it would take for a leak to get to a
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
body of water that we're trying to
 
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
protect which brings me back to my point
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
that the underlying measure here
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
ultimately is time that it would take
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
pollutant to get from a landfill to a
 
02:30:59.570 --> 02:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
body of water that we're concerned about
 
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
sure I don't disagree with that at all I
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
think time is is the key factor and I
 
02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
think that if you look at if you were to
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
survey the decisions we've made and the
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
about siding and the and the the permits
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
we've issued or denied that basically
 
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
that analysis with respect to surface
 
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
water is about ensuring that that broad
 
02:31:20.690 --> 02:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
language is satisfied which is to say
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
that the sighting in the op construction
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
and operation in the landfill will not
 
02:31:28.370 --> 02:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
pose an adverse uh you know an excessive
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
risk to the quality of that surface
 
02:31:31.969 --> 02:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
water and that we'll be able to Monitor
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
and ensure that that surface water is is
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
protected I would also note that you
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
know in terms of distance and such
 
02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
know in terms of distance and such
um

02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
while we may have surface waters around
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
our landfills at varying distances in
 
02:31:49.130 --> 02:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
almost every case or in every case there
 
02:31:50.530 --> 02:31:50.540 align:start position:0%
is groundwater
 
02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
immediately there it's right there right
 
02:31:56.690 --> 02:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
and so our Focus over time is really
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
about protecting groundwater quality and
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's why the ground or monitoring
 
02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
networks we put around landfills have
 
02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
the initial Wells very closely spaced to
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
the liner system and we monitor those
 
02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
very carefully and those become our
 
02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
initial Sentinel to determine whether
 
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's something going on and so as a
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
result I think essentially almost by
 
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
default if you will not to say that it
 
02:32:19.490 --> 02:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
requires a default but
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
the surface water gets protected because
 
02:32:23.210 --> 02:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the immediately
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
adjacent groundwater so carefully and
 
02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
closely and routinely that if there is
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
an issue we're going to identify and be
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
able to address it thank you sir thank
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
and we are just about ready to wrap up
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
so I think we've kind of talked this out
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
sure I I just wanted to make a rep a
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
real quick point with regard to coulon's
 
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
point on landfill capacity and that's
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that uh in the
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I was clear to make sure that
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
we included
 
02:32:54.479 --> 02:32:55.070 align:start position:0%
we included
um

02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:57.650 --> 02:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
clearer language for pre-existing
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
landfills that have the ability to
 
02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
expand that are already grandfailed
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in there I agree with you
 
02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
we don't want folks disposing of their
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
items somewhere else
 
02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
um but to that end I just wanted to make
 
02:33:09.770 --> 02:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
that point that I felt like that was
 
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.410 align:start position:0%
that point that I felt like that was
there

02:33:12.410 --> 02:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:33:13.730 --> 02:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
again I don't believe this this bill
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
will be exact out today we have uh
 
02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
certainly some work that needs to be
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%

to please speak to your motion all right
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am uh although I I agree that the
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
declawing of cats for
 
04:07:34.260 --> 04:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
declawing of cats for
personal

04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
personal
 
04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
um reasons and not medical reasons is is
 
04:07:41.110 --> 04:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
a terrible thing to do
 
04:07:42.960 --> 04:07:42.970 align:start position:0%
I do believe
 
04:07:42.970 --> 04:07:44.630 align:start position:0%
I do believe
[Music]

04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
that first of all it's not a problem in
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire testimony indicated there
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem New Hampshire and it
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
was very rarely done second is that
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
most veterinarians in New Hampshire and
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and don't do it and advise people on
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
other options to create the same effect
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that
 
04:08:11.520 --> 04:08:12.349 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that
um

04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh that that procedure
 
04:08:18.050 --> 04:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:08:18.060 --> 04:08:19.370 align:start position:0%
should be
um

04:08:19.370 --> 04:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.170 --> 04:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
a discussion between the veterinarian
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the owner rather than directed at
 
04:08:27.530 --> 04:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
the from the state level I think that uh
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's the type of law that uh we do not
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
need to do is direct that type of thing
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
from the state level but rather leave it
 
04:08:37.010 --> 04:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
to the doctors and the owners to figure
 
04:08:37.020 --> 04:08:37.969 align:start position:0%
to the doctors and the owners to figure
out

04:08:37.969 --> 04:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
over thank you
 
04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.130 --> 04:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
chair uh I speak in uh in favor of
 
04:08:54.170 --> 04:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
passing of uh OTP for uh H Bill 231 when
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony I found compelling
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
arguments on both sides not really
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
knowing which way to go uh as committee
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
members know I reached out to our local
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
vet to receive her uh feedback I was
 
04:09:08.290 --> 04:09:08.300 align:start position:0%
moved and and
 
04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
influenced by her letter which I
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
circulated to members of of the
 
04:09:16.729 --> 04:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
committee uh she said that she sees it
 
04:09:18.530 --> 04:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
as largely a generational thing among
 
04:09:21.530 --> 04:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
vets she said that there are still an
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
older generation of vets that do
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
continue to offer declawing of cats even
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
when it's not medically necessary she
 
04:09:31.969 --> 04:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
said in fact again this is what she said
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
when I spoke with her that there were
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
some veterinarians when people bring in
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
their cats to be spayed or neutered who
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
actually ask if if people want the cats
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
declawed while they're under anesthetic
 
04:09:45.969 --> 04:09:45.979 align:start position:0%
she also strongly
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
argued that this well as she said in in
 
04:09:51.170 --> 04:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
her uh in her letter that I circulated
 
04:09:53.210 --> 04:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
that it's her strong opinion that the
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
state has a unique opportunity to use
 
04:09:56.929 --> 04:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
the bill to support veterinarians in
 
04:09:58.370 --> 04:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
their efforts to improve Animal Welfare
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
standards she said from her perspective
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
um she would like if someone were to
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
come into her practice and ask for this
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
for her to be able to just say no it's
 
04:10:09.290 --> 04:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
against the law uh and end the
 
04:10:10.929 --> 04:10:10.939 align:start position:0%
conversation there
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
she also
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
um or I will say from from my own
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
perspective we did have a vet here who
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
testified I asked the the
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
that that witness that that vet if
 
04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
the practice of decline cats unless it's
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
formatically necessary reason
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
if she concerted cruel and in my opinion
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
she had a very long pause
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
before she said no and provided a very
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
tortured response it was not at all a
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
convincing uh answer as far as I'm
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
concerned and then also for me
 
04:10:44.819 --> 04:10:45.969 align:start position:0%
concerned and then also for me
personally

04:10:45.969 --> 04:10:45.979 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the books around animal
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
cruelty period we Define animal cruelty
 
04:10:54.050 --> 04:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
in statute and if it's our determination
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
that this is a cruel practice uh then
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
like other examples of animal cruelty it
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
should be illegal so for those reasons
 
04:11:04.130 --> 04:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair I will support the Bill
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:11:10.610 --> 04:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um two things about uh so
 
04:11:13.920 --> 04:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
um two things about uh so
um I

04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
I am hesitant to uh classify declawing
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
as animal cruelty uh because that
 
04:11:24.769 --> 04:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
invokes another whole set of portion of
 
04:11:26.689 --> 04:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
the criminal statute and I don't think
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
that it rises to that level
 
04:11:29.399 --> 04:11:30.110 align:start position:0%
that it rises to that level
um

04:11:30.110 --> 04:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is uh one thing that is different
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
about this bill from the ones we saw in
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
previous years is that uh it makes uh
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
decline of cats a violation rather than
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
being a criminal offense and I am
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
willing to supp I uh will be voting
 
04:11:51.769 --> 04:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
against the itl because I am willing to
 
04:11:54.050 --> 04:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
say um it makes sense
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh to as uh representative germano
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh provide some cover for uh
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who want to just be able
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
to say to their clients it's against the
 
04:12:04.620 --> 04:12:06.910 align:start position:0%
to say to their clients it's against the
law

04:12:06.910 --> 04:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative thank you
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
um what we heard in testimony and I
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all veterinarians and I
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't think any one veterinarian can
 
04:12:21.849 --> 04:12:21.859 align:start position:0%
speak for all
 
04:12:21.859 --> 04:12:23.510 align:start position:0%
speak for all
but

04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
from testimony that we heard from
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
several people and for me talking to
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
several vets they educate anybody that
 
04:12:32.330 --> 04:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
walks into their office that wants a
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
declaw they do a really deep assessment
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
and for the most part they talk most of
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
those people out of that declaw however
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
there are going to be exceptions to the
 
04:12:45.650 --> 04:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
rule and I believe it's between the
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
owner and the veterinarian
 
04:12:50.570 --> 04:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
to make that determination for the
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.889 --> 04:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative germano
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair I
 
04:13:00.530 --> 04:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
apologize I forgot to add something in
 
04:13:01.729 --> 04:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
my previous comments I also want to
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
point out that I received a follow-up
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
email from uh from that vet pointing out
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
that the Centers for Disease Control no
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
longer recommend declawing of cats for
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
people who have blood clotting disorders
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
um there's also other kind of testimony
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh out there I don't know if this has
 
04:13:23.090 --> 04:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
been circulated if everyone got it from
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
the from the Humane Society but from
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
um uh physician stating the same thing
 
04:13:30.410 --> 04:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the things that
 
04:13:31.729 --> 04:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
came up in the testimony which I
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
understand certainly was the concern for
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
people whose pets are very important to
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
them but they may have blood clotting
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
disorders because of medicine or or a
 
04:13:42.769 --> 04:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
disease but in any event I just wanted
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
to to make that point that it is no
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
longer recommended by the CDC uh that
 
04:13:49.610 --> 04:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
those folks have de-clead cats to
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
prevent them from
 
04:13:51.000 --> 04:13:52.849 align:start position:0%
prevent them from
um

04:13:52.849 --> 04:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
problems that might follow from being
 
04:13:56.090 --> 04:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
scratched thank you madam chair thank
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
you for my own comments I'd like to say
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
declawing cats are the only two states
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
that specifically prohibit decline by
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
Statute is New York and Maryland and
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um seeing as I don't really see that as
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming problem here in New
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where you know many cats are
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
being declawed by veterinarians
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
I I will be supporting the itl motion
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we need to really
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
put this in our statutes and
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%

04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I would like to make the motion to
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I will speak to that motion of
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
retaining that bill this bill we have
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
received some communication from Stacy
 
04:17:04.729 --> 04:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
Ober of the American Kennel Club
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
and she indicated that
 
04:17:07.680 --> 04:17:09.490 align:start position:0%
and she indicated that
um

04:17:09.490 --> 04:17:09.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
there were there are standard practices
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
that are available through AKC for
 
04:17:19.370 --> 04:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
animal groomers and I reviewed them and
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
they looked pretty comprehensive
 
04:17:25.250 --> 04:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
the suggestion from a few people
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
was that instead of having a committee a
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
study committee that we instead instruct
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture to post
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
something up on their website
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
which indicates best practices for
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
animal groomers as well as a bulletin to
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
let consumers know what to look for in
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
animal groomers when they take their
 
04:17:55.370 --> 04:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
pets to be groomed and I think that
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
makes good sense to put something out on
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture website
 
04:18:06.170 --> 04:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
so we will request them to do that and
 
04:18:08.210 --> 04:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
in the meantime this bill can be
 
04:18:11.570 --> 04:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
retained if in case we feel that we need
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
to do something more statutory set up a
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
committee or something else but I think
 
04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
that this probably
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh solves the the question that was put
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
forth by this bill and I don't know if
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's any other comment that anybody
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.689 --> 04:18:35.699 align:start position:0%

regarding House Bill 119
 
04:23:40.370 --> 04:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
any discussion on this amendment uh
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to the amendment
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is bringing uh we have
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
changed the original bill and we are
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
taking out
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the dollar amount for Homestead food
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
operations because after hearing
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
testimony there is no Enforcement issue
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
here and the original intent of the
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
original bill was supposed to be that it
 
04:24:08.279 --> 04:24:09.170 align:start position:0%
original bill was supposed to be that it
was

04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the amount was increased every year
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
regarding inflation and we just feel
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that because there's no Enforcement
 
04:24:17.929 --> 04:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
issue regarding this that the dollar
 
04:24:21.889 --> 04:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
amount is does not need to be in there
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
yes so um another aspect of this is that
 
04:24:27.720 --> 04:24:29.330 align:start position:0%
yes so um another aspect of this is that
uh

04:24:29.330 --> 04:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:31.490 --> 04:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
the this homestead exemption is
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
specifically for non-hazardous food and
 
04:24:38.689 --> 04:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
it is for food that is sold only at
 
04:24:41.210 --> 04:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
farmers markets at the farm at a farm
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
stand on the on sellers property or at
 
04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
the seller's home and uh the
 
04:24:51.250 --> 04:24:51.260 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
04:24:55.490 --> 04:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
in order to sell in venues broader than
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
that they would have to get licensed uh
 
04:25:00.530 --> 04:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
the feeling was that
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
um one of one of the aspects of
 
04:25:07.130 --> 04:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh this is that someone who wants to
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
have a broad to increase the business
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
would have to have a broader uh range of
 
04:25:17.389 --> 04:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
selling and uh so there's a sort of an
 
04:25:20.150 --> 04:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
automatic limit that just the scale of
 
04:25:21.969 --> 04:25:21.979 align:start position:0%
operations would provide
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the monetary cap is kind of
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to that someone who's doing
 
04:25:32.570 --> 04:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
jams would never get anywhere close to
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars someone who was
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
doing wedding cakes might well go over
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
that uh it's the that amount is uh not
 
04:25:43.130 --> 04:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh relevant to the purpose of making
 
04:25:44.929 --> 04:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
sure that um
 
04:25:48.050 --> 04:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
that there's appropriate food safety
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
safety oversight for things that go
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
beyond that narrow homestead exemption
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%

with raw milk and the key part of this
 
04:30:42.649 --> 04:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
one was the raw milk ice cream and a our
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%

Honorable O'Connor was uh for a very
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
long time in the dairy industry so I'd
 
04:31:19.849 --> 04:31:19.859 align:start position:0%
really trust his judgment and he felt
 
04:31:23.330 --> 04:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
that on this bill uh was not appropriate
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%

there are
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
um for very good reasons there are
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences should this bill

04:33:00.649 --> 04:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
ahead okay so uh when we heard uh when
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill uh it was fairly
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
clear in the process of the hearing that
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
a task force was not going to really get
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
us where we wanted to be with this what
 
04:33:15.849 --> 04:33:15.859 align:start position:0%
we really needed was to have
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
some person or entity that would be able
 
04:33:22.970 --> 04:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
to help connect Farmers with the help
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
with with the assistance they needed in
 
04:33:28.010 --> 04:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
order to get appropriate assistance
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
applying for uh energy uh uh so
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
um on Farm energy grants and whether
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's related to solar or wind or
 
04:33:40.680 --> 04:33:41.330 align:start position:0%
it's related to solar or wind or
um

04:33:41.330 --> 04:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
more storage or efficiency
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
um and uh I had some conversations with
 
04:33:48.900 --> 04:33:50.750 align:start position:0%
um and uh I had some conversations with
the

04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:53.810 --> 04:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
um with number of people and it all sort
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
of pointed in the direction of seeing if
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
this was something that we could work
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with Cooperative Extension I
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
spoke with the
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
um director of Cooperative Extension and
 
04:34:08.810 --> 04:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh he explained the process that they
 
04:34:11.529 --> 04:34:11.539 align:start position:0%
use for doing
 
04:34:14.830 --> 04:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
education programs like the pesticide
 
04:34:19.010 --> 04:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
so the pesticide licensing is done by
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture but the
 
04:34:23.449 --> 04:34:23.459 align:start position:0%
training for that is done by Cooperative
 
04:34:28.730 --> 04:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
Extension on a contract basis and uh
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that we worked out was that
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
there could be someone in Cooperative
 
04:34:35.209 --> 04:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
Extension who would be a field
 
04:34:39.170 --> 04:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
specialist for energy purposes and there
 
04:34:40.609 --> 04:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
would be a contract between the
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to make that
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
possible this is something that we given
 
04:34:50.830 --> 04:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
this would require an appropriation
 
04:34:54.289 --> 04:34:54.299 align:start position:0%
of about about a hundred thousand
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
dollars which is about what it costs to
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
get a full-time person plus all the
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
benefits and all the travel expenses
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and
 
04:35:02.760 --> 04:35:03.830 align:start position:0%
Etc and
um

04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:08.029 --> 04:35:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh so uh that's something that wouldn't
 
04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
be possible to bring to for us to get in
 
04:35:15.529 --> 04:35:15.539 align:start position:0%
get into the build process uh or we
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
couldn't re because because it's got the
 
04:35:20.631 --> 04:35:20.641 align:start position:0%
appropriation we couldn't do that uh
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
this year of this term but we could do
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
it uh in the second year of this term uh
 
04:35:26.400 --> 04:35:27.590 align:start position:0%
it uh in the second year of this term uh
and

04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
um chairman Aaron uh spoke with the uh
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
chair of finance and uh got some
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
feedback that uh a hundred thousand
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
dollars for a purpose like this would
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably be available so this is
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
something we'll work on to re uh to
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
amend the bill in the fall and bring It
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
Forward again uh in bring it forward to
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%

okay

04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:18.650 --> 04:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh so this was my bill uh and
 
04:37:23.160 --> 04:37:24.289 align:start position:0%
uh so this was my bill uh and
um

04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
the there's a bill coming through the
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
Senate uh that is a study committee on
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
uh processing non-amentable meat uh and
 
04:37:37.689 --> 04:37:37.699 align:start position:0%
Anonymous animals and
 
04:37:43.369 --> 04:37:43.379 align:start position:0%
uh that uh there's a possibility that
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
that study committee will make
 
04:37:49.609 --> 04:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would require there
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
is to still be or that would be easier
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with if we still have the Meat
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
Inspection program uh in the statute uh
 
04:38:00.170 --> 04:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
because it's probably easier to amend
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
rather than to completely replace it so
 
04:38:03.900 --> 04:38:04.490 align:start position:0%
rather than to completely replace it so
um

04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:08.570 --> 04:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
in case we need this bill for uh for
 
04:38:11.449 --> 04:38:11.459 align:start position:0%
further legislation related to that
 
04:38:14.209 --> 04:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
study uh we I think it makes sense to
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
retain it and uh so um
 
04:38:21.890 --> 04:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree thank you very much for
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%

motion passes thank you
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
close the exec on HB 493
 
04:39:13.970 --> 04:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
we have on our schedule here to exec HB
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.020 --> 04:39:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
we are probably going to be getting some
 
04:39:27.170 --> 04:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
amendments on those two bills so they
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
are not ready to be exec today and I
 
04:39:32.830 --> 04:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
will schedule
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
those two bills to be exec next week
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh in the morning so I will I don't know
 
04:39:44.448 --> 04:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
if I have to open those up and recess
 
04:39:47.330 --> 04:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
them or how does that work I think
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess uh open up HB 253 and I will
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
say that that bill will be exact next
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
week on um let's see what is it March
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
March 7th there you go March 7th and uh
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
04:40:09.288 --> 04:40:09.298 align:start position:0%
probably around 10 o'clock
 
04:40:12.970 --> 04:40:12.980 align:start position:0%
so I I will recess that exec until then
 
04:40:17.448 --> 04:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
and then I will open up hb56
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I will recess the exec for that bill
 
04:40:24.050 --> 04:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
until March 7th at 10 A.M
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I will close that now as well we
 
04:40:30.288 --> 04:40:30.298 align:start position:0%
have hb602
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
which is relative to landfill citing
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
and do I hear a motion representative
 
04:40:35.400 --> 04:40:36.770 align:start position:0%
and do I hear a motion representative
Bixby

04:40:36.770 --> 04:40:36.780 align:start position:0%

04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes I move that we retain
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
do I hear a second uh I will second that
 
04:40:43.020 --> 04:40:46.250 align:start position:0%
do I hear a second uh I will second that
actually

04:40:46.250 --> 04:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
and would you speak to your motion yes
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
um this uh we have two bills that deal
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
with landfill citing this one and HB 56
 
04:40:59.570 --> 04:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
we decided this morning that HB 56 would
 
04:41:01.490 --> 04:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
be the better vehicle for us to use at
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
the moment uh and it's a possibility
 
04:41:05.400 --> 04:41:06.948 align:start position:0%
the moment uh and it's a possibility
that

04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:10.130 --> 04:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
um in the various discussions with uh
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other body about all the different
 
04:41:15.050 --> 04:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
landfill bills coming forward uh we
 
04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
might want to have a vehicle available
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
to put a bit put a bill in next uh next
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
year the second year of this term and uh
 
04:41:27.410 --> 04:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
by retaining 602 we'll have a vehicle we
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
can amend it in any way that we wish

231 HB 221 hb119 HB 348
 
04:42:32.958 --> 04:42:34.788 align:start position:0%
231 HB 221 hb119 HB 348
which

04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%

please make sure you get them to me
 
04:42:40.320 --> 04:42:42.708 align:start position:0%
please make sure you get them to me
and

04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
again we will have an exec session next
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
week for HB 253 probably we'll do a
 
04:42:51.298 --> 04:42:53.090 align:start position:0%
week for HB 253 probably we'll do a
short

04:42:53.090 --> 04:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
short
 
04:42:53.100 --> 04:42:54.770 align:start position:0%
short
um

04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:56.930 --> 04:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
do we need a short committee work
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
session prior so that we can go over the
 
04:42:59.638 --> 04:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
session prior so that we can go over the
amendments

04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
before we go into an exec session I
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
believe that would be an order yeah that
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
so if we did
 
04:43:10.320 --> 04:43:11.750 align:start position:0%
so if we did
um

04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
if we if we had our work session from
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
say 10 to 10 30
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
or both those bills uh or 10
 
04:43:22.980 --> 04:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
or both those bills uh or 10

04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we probably have um
 
04:43:33.170 --> 04:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
work session and then maybe a short
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
caucus time and then exec and then we
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%

dear commissioner Jasper the house
 
04:47:07.730 --> 04:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
environment and agricultural committee
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
received a bill HB 326 proposing a ban
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
on second generation anticoagulant
 
04:47:16.970 --> 04:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
rodenticides sgars with some specific
 
04:47:16.980 --> 04:47:18.350 align:start position:0%
rodenticides sgars with some specific
exemptions

04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
the impetus for the bill was animal
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation centers observing an
 
04:47:24.288 --> 04:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
increase in cases of wild animals
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
suffering anticoagulant poisoning we
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
heard from environmental organizations
 
04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife rehabilitators who
 
04:47:32.570 --> 04:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
testified that poisoned rodents before
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
they die make easy prey for Raptors and
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
other carnivores and that the corpses
 
04:47:38.690 --> 04:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
pose a poisoning threat for carrion
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
eaters we heard from other witnesses
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
that rodent infestations particularly
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
rat infestations can be very difficult
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
to control with alternate methods on
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
February 7th commissioner Jasper

sgars and developing a solution for this
 
04:48:12.050 --> 04:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
problem one possible approach would be

classifying sgars as restricted use the
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%

finds a resolution to the problem that
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
can be achieved within current statute
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking the bill can be

the issue HB 326 will be available as a
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
