on this last week
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
and uh told him that the representative
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
that the documentation we had from the

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
about that the executive uh

director for the town
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
was uh personally in favor of but it did
 
00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:25.699 align:start position:0%
not say that the town
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
selectman I believe their select board
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
ruled was in favor and I asked them to
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
try and pull that document together for
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
today so that the committee could hear
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
that that's been a long-standing policy
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
of this committee and I told the
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
representative if we didn't have that
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%

00:08:59.810 --> 00:08:59.820 align:start position:0%

202307434 and I would move the adoption

[Music]

[Music]
um

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say as I said briefly
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
um this this has been a conversation
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
um representative Walsh as he is not
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
completely crazy about it
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
um uh is in favor of this amendment as
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
it was brought forward and it's a
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
compromise and
 
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
compromise and
um

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
does anyone have questions on the
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
amendment is brought forward
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
I believe the fire chief originally was
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
looking for 14 feet
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the homeowner had built
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
10p 10 feet and it was blocking the
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
permitting for them to get an occupancy
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
permit and so now this settlement is has
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.130 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so this as I read it this is only
 
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.269 align:start position:0%
yeah so this as I read it this is only
for

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
um one in one or two family dwelling
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
units so they don't they can still do
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
pretty much what they want with
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
commercial and multi-family
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
units the way this law reads and the
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
original one kind of excluded all of the
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure the answer on that does
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
the original House Bill 296 is
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
the original House Bill 296 is
introduced

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
just stopped or it said the provision of
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
the state fire code Associated rules
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
should not supersede the authority of
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
local land use boards on the planning
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
and zoning period
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
so now they've changed it to just only
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
apply to one and two family units
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
and that's I guess what we're voting on
 
00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:34.610 align:start position:0%
and that's I guess what we're voting on
now

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
that would that would be it
 
00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:37.459 align:start position:0%
representative Newton
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:50.540 align:start position:0%
the fire chiefs were concerned about
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
apparatus access into single and two
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
family homes I gather
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like the 12 feet is enough
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
for vehicles to be traveling in and
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
outbound at the same time enough space
 
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.110 align:start position:0%
outbound at the same time enough space
I

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.129 align:start position:0%
I
um

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
I I believe I believe at the 12 foot
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
where the average vehicle somewhere no
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
wider than eight foot six I think they
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion that there was
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
enough room to pass by and not that
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
people that you could run two vehicles
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
in both directions thank you you're
 
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.970 align:start position:0%
in both directions thank you you're
welcome

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman for giving me
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
they built the opportunity to give you a
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
further comment one of the concerns I
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
had when the initial bill came up was
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion like what if a
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
driveway is only 30 feet from the road
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
and the fire trucks could park on the
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
side of the road for that matter but now
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment clarifies it the
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
driveways over 150 feet in length of the
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
12 foot so that gives me a little more
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
information than I had with the original
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%

Mills
and

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.490 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
discussion would you like to speak and I
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
do wish to speak to my motion thank you
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've had uh some discussions with with
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
some member as this committee including
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and members of my caucus
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
and I think while there's a lot of
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
support for the for the principal of
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill there are some members who
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
have indicated that because the way it's
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
written they're a little confused about
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
whether it's state buildings or
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
buildings that are that are financed
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
with State funds there's also the
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
question whether we're going to make any
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
money from the highway fund
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
I I sh but I still feel we need to do
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
something electric vehicles are are the
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
wave of the future the private sector is
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
already uh getting ahead of us I know
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
where I work up in West Lebanon doing
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
private security the company I I do
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
provide the security on a subcontract
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
but Nolo nordis has such hookups for
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
employees to hook in their vehicles I
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
know the Walmart in West Lebanon has
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
hook-ins the private sector is beginning
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
to provide that and I would say another
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
thing too we I think we need to work out
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Kinks
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
because I think one one of the thing
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
with the with the State Workforce we're
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
in a labor shortage and that includes
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state where uh Workforce and as far
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
as Recruitment and Retention this this
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
may be the difference between keeping or
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
a tracking plan I know you say well
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's crazy but you never know to be
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
able to charge your vehicle at work
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
rather than go to a gas station while
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
you're working I think maybe an
 
00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.610 align:start position:0%
you're working I think maybe an
advantage

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:48.620 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh I I I feel too that if there are
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
there are details of this that need to
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
be worked out I would like to do that I
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
know we've retained another bill that
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
you and share uh chairman of the
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of the science technology entry
 
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:03.860 align:start position:0%
committee have
 
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
committee have
uh

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
are sponsoring and fine but I think we
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
need to do something about this issue
 
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
and we also need to consider raising
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
some Revenue as I said I'm on the
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
commission now that hopefully was was
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
created last year hopefully we recreate
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
it of course I don't know whether I'll
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
be on that commission but even if I'm
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
not I'm going to be pushing for
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
something to raise money for our
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
highways and this could be a small thing
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
to get started we may need to start
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
small because the commissions where it
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
may take a a year or two so I would at
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
the very least move that we retain this
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
bill we come back later in the in in the
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
year probably most likely in the early
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
late summer early fall and work on it
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
and maybe combine the best of of your
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
bill and chairman vose's bill with this
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill and hopefully come up with
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
something that later in the year we can
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
bring back to the Full House thank you
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I would concur
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
with all the statements made by the Vice
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
chair I'd probably remove the word crazy
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
out of there but other than that I agree
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
with with everything the uh okay yeah
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay and and no not at all and um and uh
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
it's my hope that if we we retain these
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then we move forward with the
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
commission uh I think we can come out
 
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
with a better bill that will benefit
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
employers employees and people traveling
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
to uh to our state is there anyone else
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%

yes uh just quickly
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
would it be possible when this is taken
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
up after it's retained to get to get
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
some information from whatever is the
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
best source of any and all state funded
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
housing projects that are maybe in the
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
so representative you're saying that we
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
when when we go to work on these bills
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
that we also consider
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
housing developments it was that your
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
five

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
and one any funded housing meeting the
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
definition of a project so I I just
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
wondered if that would be useful or at
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
least additional information as we go
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward not that it would stop anything
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
from going forward but if there's three
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
projects for instance in towns XYZ might
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
be useful to know okay I agree we can
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
pull that together for you yes
 
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.210 align:start position:0%
pull that together for you yes
representative

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
Gaddafi in the Private Industry
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
those are going to become benefit to the
 
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.450 align:start position:0%
those are going to become benefit to the
job

00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see how this is ever going
 
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.409 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see how this is ever going
to

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
to
produce

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to charge
 
00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:11.690 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to charge
money

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
the transportation department
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
because even if the state puts them in
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the employee is going to expect the
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
state to pick up the tab the same way
 
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.690 align:start position:0%
state to pick up the tab the same way
that

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:22.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh businesses are doing
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
I promise and it's in places where they
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
have them it's just part of the job
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting as as a benefit to us I
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money going to the
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your comment yes
 
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.270 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your comment yes
representative

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just um got a question
 
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.169 align:start position:0%
I'm just um got a question
um

00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
do we have any legislation that requires
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
gas stations to be built anywhere and I
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up to that if uh I may to
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
answer your question I do not believe
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
that's the case you had further question
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.130 align:start position:0%
yes so
if

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
the private sector has taken care of all
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
the fuel needs of automobiles at someone
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
else's expense and not the general
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
Public's expense then I'm kind of
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
curious why are we
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
wanting to get into the energy business
 
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:31.700 align:start position:0%
by making requirements that
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
the public sector itself
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
can take care of if there's money
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
because there's obviously money to be
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
made in this deal so I'm just curious
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
why we're interfering with the public
 
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
Commerce of electric vehicles
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think that was a would you
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
believe question to me
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and thank you and thank you for that
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully by the end of this summer
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
beginning of of fall we're going to have
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
some answers for you on that at least
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
how far everyone's looking at this point
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
how far the federal government is is
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to participate in that cost and
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
grants and so forth yes representative
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
yes so this bill tries to lead that it's
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
all about
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh buildings and stuff funded by the
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
state yet the section two says single
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
family and duplex dwellings could
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
somebody tell me if the state is
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
involved in building single family and
 
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
answer is questions well noted
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
any other further yes RIP Sims thank you
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the other thing I've been
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
confused about this bill uh since even
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
this morning I think it was clarified a
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
little bit on page two Roman 4 appears
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
to apply to any other state building
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
including Office Buildings particularly
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh in line five where it mentions trucks
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh so it would be good to clarify
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
whether this is you know State Office
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
Buildings are covered by by Roman 4.
 
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
I would say we get a little further out
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
here and get our capital budget perhaps
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
we would put together a subcommittee and
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh try and hash out or at least find the
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions that we want answered and I
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
think I've heard some good discussion
 
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
just uh remember you might those of you
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
who are here the on the 24th I did ask
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
Charlie arlinghaus about charging
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
stations being the department of
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
administrative services and of course I
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
think he his answer wasn't totally what
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
I wanted but he said there's plenty of
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
money out there it sounds like the state
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
is going to begin to apply for those
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds to hopefully install those
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
charging stations
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
in State Office Buildings around that
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
the buildings they manage around the
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
state but I think this bill one of the
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
reasons I'm sort of uh in favor of this
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
bill is to give them an incentive to do
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
that uh but I realize that it's going to
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
be retains but so I think the state is
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
beginning to make efforts but I think
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
this bill will if it was to pass in some
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
form we combine it with uh the chairmans
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
and representative Moses Bill we would
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
encourage them even further thank you
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Connor
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
yeah um now these charging stations that
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
might possibly be built are they going
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be um
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
have adapters for different style
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
Vehicles because like I know the Tesla
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
takes a different one and like Chevy
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
takes a different one so I'm just
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably pointing that out maybe you
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
might want to you know look into that
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
too yeah Point well taken okay
 
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
too yeah Point well taken okay
representative

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I will just we have a couple minutes
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
just for further information
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I own a um
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
convenience store gas operation
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
we were approached by the state last
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.669 align:start position:0%
we were approached by the state last
year

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
because we're on a major Corridor North
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to get in the first
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
round of funding X number of stations X
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
number of miles my area was identified
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
as one of those
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
um we and there was money in that
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
program to upgrade our infrastructure to
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
bring the power out to and so forth uh
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed a little too costly for us at
 
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
this point in time so we didn't move
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
forward but there are also um
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
other agents out there then to come in
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
and say if if you don't want to move to
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
that expense at that point they'll
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
become a subcontractor they'll they'll
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
take care of the infrastructure and send
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
us a few pennies back every year and at
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
that point in time it didn't seem the
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
right goal for us but I'm going to say
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot of activity and I
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
believe there are two or three rounds of
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
this money out there so one way or the
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
other it's going to happen so it'd be
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
good if we participate in in how that
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
happened so
 
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:25.220 align:start position:0%
so if there's no further discussion
 
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:28.580 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and has been seconded
 
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:31.460 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:34.940 align:start position:0%
606 FN
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
and if the
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of the motion to
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
retain then you'll signify by saying aye
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed nay
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
and with that the clerk will call the

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:05.540 align:start position:0%
uh hearing
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not taking a shot at
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
your last name and
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
um welcome to Public Works and uh it's a
 
01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:25.220 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you here
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
we in the committee in the past we would
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
start off with the treasurer and the
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
scheduling did not work for us so we've
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
heard from a few department heads so I
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
think it's it's very appropriate timing
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh now that we have this discussion and
 
01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.069 align:start position:0%
uh now that we have this discussion and
uh

01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for being here good
 
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record State
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Monica mazzapelli and just a
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
quick disclaimer I I had a virus last
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
week so I'm supposed to keep my mask for
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
a few more days so but if there is
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
anything that I said you would like me
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
to repeat or or go over again I'll be
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so thank you Mr chairman and um
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
so today I was invited to talk about
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
um that affordability so I'm gonna try
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
to just walk you through the things that
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
we look at in the treasury and I'll try
 
01:02:21.609 --> 01:02:21.619 align:start position:0%
to stay at a higher level
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
but if I lose anybody please don't
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
hesitate to ask me
 
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:29.870 align:start position:0%
so I will um so I provided a handout
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
so I will um so I provided a handout
[Music]

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
and I will probably start with
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
and really the treasury
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
um looks at on data affordability and
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
two different ways one we um we prepared
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
a data affordability study every year
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
and we work with the state's financial
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
advisor to um to put the study together
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we do this every year so you're
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with with what we do
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
here but to study what what this what
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
this work does is really we current a
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
bunch of numbers we um we get some
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
actuals and then we project some debt
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
metrics that allows us to see and
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
evaluate how the state is doing in terms
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
of its debt profile so we calculate you
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
know certain metrics and the ones we
 
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:23.780 align:start position:0%
look at is a debt to personal income
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
debt per capita and the most important
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
one that we look at is on that service
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
to uh to revenue ratio and those are the
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
the metrics that um that we review every
 
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.609 align:start position:0%
the metrics that um that we review every
year

01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the other sort of tool that we have
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
is prescribing statue and that's an RSA
 
01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
is prescribing statue and that's an RSA
6c2

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
6c2
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
and that um you know that really
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
prescribes how much debt the state can
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
afford and we're supposed to calculate
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
this amount and and also certify to the
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance that this
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
is the amount that um essentially the
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can only
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
um authorize up to that number so what
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
the law says is the legislature can
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
author cannot authorize
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is in excess of 10 of unrestricted
 
01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:23.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue so that's that service paid with
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
we call it net tax supported debt or
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
Debt Pay with General funds and that's
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
actual and projected that service so we
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
need to determine how much are actual
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
Debt Service we also need to project our
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
debt service
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
and then we need to compare it to 10 of
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
under restricted Revenue again it's a
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
calculation and what that does is really
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
the statutory limit how much does the
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
state can
 
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.569 align:start position:0%
state can
um

01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
can borrow essentially
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
um that is a little bit of high in our
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
view but it's still in status it
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
provides a guardrail how much the state
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
can borrow can borrow
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
um for capital projects
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
so um on page three I quickly
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
um I can walk you through some of the
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
the rages and metrics that we look at so
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
every year we we've been August for for
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
the last several years the treasury has
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
been used in this number about 120
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
million in Born authorizations so we
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
take that number and we say we're gonna
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
see what this does to our debt metrics
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
so we've been consistent over time and
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
so we are assuming that we're going to
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
issue about 60 million dollars in bonds
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
every year to pay for the capital
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
projects are authorized by all of you
 
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
and you uh you all have the difficult
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
tasks to approve the Corporal budget
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's really my job is really to Crunch
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
a bunch of numbers to help you with that
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
decision right and so
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
so in the study we assume that we're
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
going to issue 60 million every year and
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
then we we see what those you know how
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
those ratios perform and um so again for
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
for this year this is just a quick
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
summary of what the study shows but
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
um in 22 we're project you were
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
calculating the the debt metrics of
 
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.370 align:start position:0%
calculating the the debt metrics of
um

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
um well the first line is actually our
 
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.030 align:start position:0%
um well the first line is actually our
total

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
total
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
um outstanding debt so that's showing
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
um 507 million dollars in net tax
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
supported that and fiscal year 22 and
 
01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:30.349 align:start position:0%
supported that and fiscal year 22 and
then

01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
um again the projection is assuming that
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue 60 million each
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
year we project on that service all the
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
way to 26 and by 26 it looks like I'll
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
send the debt will be about 516 million
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
so with that number then we start
 
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:47.780 align:start position:0%
calculating the other important ratios
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
and we're using um
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
debt to personal income
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
um as probably you all know personal
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
income in in New Hampshire is strong so
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
um we're using the actual figure that
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
was published in 2021 and we obtained
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
that figure from the Bureau of economic
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
analysis so we use that personal income
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
and then we're projecting for the rest
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
of the the fiscal years from 23 to 26 we
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
project that that personal income is
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to grow about four percent each
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
year and those are the ratios that that
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
are calculated
 
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:28.940 align:start position:0%
same with that per capita
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
right now the population is about 1.3
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
million we'll obtain that figure from
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
the U.S Census Bureau and then we
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
project that for the over the next few
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal years the population is going to
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
grow about 0.5 percent every year and
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's been consistent in his
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
historically and that's how we're com
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're calculating those numbers
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
um and the same with that that service
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
to Roman ratio again that's the that's
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
the metric that we pay more attention to
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
um 10 is what the rating agencies look
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
at and they say 10 is excessive that's
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
also the number prescribed in the
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
statute but but again that's sort of our
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
our threshold the limit so we always
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
want to calculate or we want to be at a
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
number or a ratio that is way below that
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
10 Mark and so as you can see
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line in 2022 we have a
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
debt to revenue ratio of four percent so
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
the state is doing excellent
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
um with with their debt to Urban ratio
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
and this is because we've had
 
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
and this is because we've had
um

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.970 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue performance has been again
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
outperforming over the last couple of
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
years and
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
the the the the
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
projections that we have for the debt to
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
run a ratio we actually use very
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
conservative Revenue projections from 23
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
to 26.
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I always say my job is not really to
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
predict Revenue my job is to really
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
stress our ratios to see you know how
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know if revenues were not performing
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
as well how will our debt profile look
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
like so so again we're using in this
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
study very conservative
 
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.709 align:start position:0%
study very conservative
um

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
um revenue forecast the theme in 23 we
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
use a one percent
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
um growth rate and then in 24 we we
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually had a decrease we used a
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
decline of one percent and 25 we said
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
well there will be no Remnant growth and
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
then it was a a 0.5 growth and and 26.
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
again I'm just just stressing our debt
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
profile here but again even with those
 
01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.809 align:start position:0%
profile here but again even with those
numbers

01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you know using the assumption that we
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
will use about that we will issue about
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
60 million each year
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
that's how the ratios perform
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that's a sort of quick overview of
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
what we do we also in the study we we
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
stress our our debt profile in different
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
ways we include all the debt the state
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's guaranteed to other authorities
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
and municipalities so we include those
 
01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.050 align:start position:0%
and municipalities so we include those
those

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
um that debt assuming that the state
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
were to assume all of that day we
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
included in the calculation to see how
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
those ratios change but again even with
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
those stressors or even using more um
 
01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:21.410 align:start position:0%
those stressors or even using more um
um

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I guess lower Revenue assumptions we
 
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.090 align:start position:0%
um I guess lower Revenue assumptions we
um

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
at this moment the the ratio is way
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
below the 10 and that's how we want to
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so perhaps I want to stop there to see
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions I could just
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
continue to maybe leave questions at the
 
01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.669 align:start position:0%
continue to maybe leave questions at the
end

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
any questions at this point my My Hope
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
Is we will go through the majority and
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
then I think questions will come in does
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions at this time
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
please continue man absolutely
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
so the next page is is you know again
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
the calculations that we do for for the
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
um for the debt limit prescribed in our
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
says 6C and and again this is just
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
trying to determine
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
um how much more anal that service this
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
day could afford so again it's a it's a
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
bunch of numbers that we we crunch here
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
but we essentially use our current the
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
First Column is just shine our actual
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
Debt Service and the second column is
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
including um
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
um we're assuming that we're going to
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
issue all of The Debt Service that has
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
been authorized and unissued we haven't
 
01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:34.699 align:start position:0%
issued those bonds and that's about
 
01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:37.820 align:start position:0%
360.5 million of of
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
authorizations and then we also include
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
all the guaranteed debt uh debt that the
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
state guarantee for other authorities
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
like the business Finance Authority and
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
other municipalities and then we we
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
calculate this total projected debt We
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
compare to the 10 percent of our
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
restricted revenue and the last column
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
really shows if you look at the
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
highlighted amount or the Bullet amount
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
it looks like in 24 we could actually
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
afford another 100 million of Debt
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
Service according to this calculation so
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
what that mean is you know the state
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
could actually issue or authorize
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
another billion dollars 1.2 billion
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
dollars but again that will reach the 10
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
threshold that we really don't want to
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
reach but again this is a career
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
relation we have to prepare it by
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
Statute we have to prepare this amount
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
and also certify it to the legislative
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
budget assistant this is a preliminary
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
numbers actually we're I'm using it for
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
for this presentation but we still have
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
to verify some of this numbers so that
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
we haven't provided that uh to to
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant but we're
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
about to do that in the next few days
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
we'll get those numbers done
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so that's what that does so we again
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
we we review that affordability
 
01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:54.890 align:start position:0%
we we review that affordability
um

01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
and again we use the 120 million sort of
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um number and has been used over the
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
last several fiscal years I think in the
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
past it was 125
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
um 120 really as what we use and it's
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's just showing a predictable
 
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
it's just showing a predictable
um

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a predictable number that you're
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
going to see as part of that service to
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
to show your debt service
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
um so page five is just I included you
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
know several considerations so why do we
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
care about all of this
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
um well the reason we care about keeping
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
our ratio slow and we do this because
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
um or borrowing costs are really
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
influenced by our our credit rating so
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that our debt
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
profile of what the state the the states
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
that policy remains consistent remains
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
strong in order to you know this is just
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
a component of what the rating agencies
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
look at and so maintaining that
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
stability and our debt profile
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
um healthy allows us to have a good um
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
credit rating so the rating agencies
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
also look at all the things and and
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I included in this page they
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
look at the levels in the rainy day fund
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
um they want to see that the state has a
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
um a structured budget is able to
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
balance the value budget
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
um in also the rate I just also look at
 
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:30.020 align:start position:0%
the budgetary pressures created by
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid pension and post employment
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
um uh payments and expenditures
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
they look at the stability and diversity
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
of our Revenue sources so in New
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have several different ways
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
we collect Revenue here so that's
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
another positive uh credit positive we
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
call it and also they look at you know
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
how much flexibility this day has to
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
manage the revenues expenditures and uh
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
and Reserve levels and the funding
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the general fund to um the
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
so essentially our our
 
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.090 align:start position:0%
so essentially our our
um

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
debt levels and that their management
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
practices are considered credit positive
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those things that the
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
reigning agencies don't really worry too
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
much about when it comes to New
 
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.390 align:start position:0%
much about when it comes to New
Hampshire

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
also as you can see the ratio has
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
improved over time so I'm including the
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
ratio over the last 10 years and you
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
know back in 2013 it was 7.7 percent it
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
increased slightly in 24 2015 that was
 
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.250 align:start position:0%
increased slightly in 24 2015 that was
because

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
um there was this change in the Medicaid
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax was
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
prior to 2014 it was considered
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
restricted Revenue so then it switched
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
to restricted in that obviously changed
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
the calculation but then after that it
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
started decreasing over time it
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
increased slightly and um
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
in 2020 because of the economic crisis
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
caused by the pandemic but then with 21
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and 22
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
so on page six it's just part of what I
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to quickly mention
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
obviously as you all know boring costs
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
are higher than I expected to remain at
 
01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:18.860 align:start position:0%
that level for some time
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
also as a reminder of perhaps this is
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
not something you track as as much as I
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
do but um we have currently or at the
 
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:29.540 align:start position:0%
end of fiscal year 22
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
316.5 million of bonds authorized in an
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
issue that means that's something you
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
already authorized and prior budgets but
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
we have not issued them yet we have not
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
issued bonds yet because the
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures for those projects have not
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
occurred or or they've been delayed so
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
this sort of what we've been seeing
 
01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.830 align:start position:0%
this sort of what we've been seeing
lately

01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
lately
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and just obviously as a general
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
comment maintaining um
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
you know borrowing a borrowing capacity
 
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:02.900 align:start position:0%
maintenance a strong capacity to borrow
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
is also a healthy and as prudent you
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
know that way you can consider an
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
anticipated Capital needs or priorities
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
that um a part of you know the
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
essentially what this current budget or
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 is trying to trying to do
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
so that way you have the ability to to
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
make those decisions
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
and lastly I just wanted to include our
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
ratings just so you you have them uh
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
this day has strong credit ratings
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
um it last year SMP changed the state's
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
a look Outlook from
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
stable to positive and that is because
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies can keep seeing the
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
state how the economy is growing
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the economy is strong and also they
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
like the idea that the state put more
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
money into the rainy day fund the rainy
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
day fund is a key component because they
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
see that as a measure of how the state
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to respond in times
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
of economic downturns so again
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining liquidity
 
01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.689 align:start position:0%
maintaining liquidity
um

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
structural budget you know having a
 
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.550 align:start position:0%
structural budget you know having a
um

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
it gives a strategy to manage the
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
financial position of the state is is
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
what the rating agencies like to see
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
the last page is just included you know
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
where we WE Post all our Publications
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
online so I just wanted to mention that
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
as a reminder
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
so that's what I wanted to just cover
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
today as part of you know how we this
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
treasury looks at that affordability
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
again we just calculate a lot of numbers
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
for you and I know this is also
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
um this is how we come up with the idea
 
01:18:45.659 --> 01:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
um this is how we come up with the idea
of

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the 120 million that we typically
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
include in our calculations I'll be
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
for that overview and we'll take
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
questions moment
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
um this committee has for the most part
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
over the 20 years or so back and forth
 
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:04.580 align:start position:0%
that I've been here has been comfortable
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
with this deciding capital projects and
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
our numbers have been fairly close to
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
that hundred and twenty million dollars
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
there were years it was a little less
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
and so forth but I believe last time
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
around 120 million dollars could you
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
and it's troubling me
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
is that projects that normally would
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
come through our committee are being
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
heard directly in finance
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
and that's that's none of your uh your
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
issue but my question is
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
if there was legislation this last week
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
to create a fund for water quality of 25
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
and there was another project which is
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
part of the I-93 project Exit 14 as it
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
was generally x4a that there was another
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
bill that came through that comes close
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
to adding uh 900 000 onto a project
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it's it's troubling to myself and
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sure people on my committee is that
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
going to affect our capital budget or do
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
you have some other secret pot of money
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
out there that that those projects could
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
be drawn from
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is a great
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
question it really has to it needs to be
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
included as part of this overall bonding
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
authorization so even if you approve a
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
number 120 125 but if on the side there
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
are other bonding authorizations that's
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
part of this whole equation it really
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
has to all be considered so it really is
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
a state as a whole how much
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
um wants to bond and so obviously we
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
Bond based on authorization so you
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
authorize 120 the other numbers need to
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
come together so the
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
every other year so or sometimes we see
 
01:20:58.679 --> 01:20:59.870 align:start position:0%
every other year so or sometimes we see
those

01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
um there are some authorizations that
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
happen during an off cycle
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
um you know the capital budgets
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
authorized and then the next fiscal year
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
some other product is is authorized so
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
we need to track that we need to really
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh verify that that authorization that
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
we consider that as part of what we are
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
calculations so yes the quick answer is
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes it needs to be considered they um if
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I could on the guaranteed debt uh UNH
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
has had a couple different capital
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
projects that have run over a term of
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
four or five years and I believe this
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
year it comes to a conclusion we're
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
about to hear from them we'll hear what
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
their plans are but and I believe it was
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
17 million dollars drawn down this time
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
is is the UNH money when that happens is
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
that considered part of the guaranteed
 
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.450 align:start position:0%
that considered part of the guaranteed
debt

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
so two things so so the quick answer is
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
not guaranteed that anything that we
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
Bond or that is part of the capital
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget we consider that
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
we pay that with General funds so
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
anything that is so the 17 million that
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
was already
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
authorized in a
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I guess two parts to your to
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
two answers it's not guaranteed that and
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
that 70 million was already authorized
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have to be included in
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
this years
 
01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.850 align:start position:0%
this years
um

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
bonding authorization okay if if I could
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman so that's 17 million
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
dollars was general fund and not bonding
 
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.930 align:start position:0%
dollars was general fund and not bonding
money

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
well it's paid with general fund meaning
 
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
is so the this the term of guarantee the
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
term of State guarantee that's that's
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
really when um the state for example the
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
the the the easy easiest example is the
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority they they are
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
authorized to issue bonds but then the
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
state backs that with the fulfilling
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
credit of the state if if the business
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
and Finance Authority can't pay those
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
bonds that's that's what we consider
 
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
bonds that's that's what we consider
um

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um guaranteed debt with the UNH debt
 
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
that is direct that is that is that that
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state has
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
um promised to pay on behalf of
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
um university system of New Hampshire so
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's that's the state debt
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm gonna call it okay thank you
 
01:23:29.219 --> 01:23:32.390 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm gonna call it okay thank you
the

01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
so the question will come up from the
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
new members and some of the others so we
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
we have a that 60 million dollars that
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and 120 cumulative uh
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
the question's been asked in the past
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
that if that tweaked a million this way
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
or a million that way or five million
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
dollars that that probably not
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
considering all this other debt that
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
they're trying to throw in US probably
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue but when you start
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
getting I believe the number we've heard
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
in the past you start getting out past
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
15 million or so then it starts to
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.610 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
I've heard it really doesn't so a few
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
million so to answer your question a few
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
million won't won't change the number I
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
know in the past I think it was last
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
during the last biennium it was about
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
130 million that was authorized so that
 
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't really change
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
um we we're not concerned about that
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
just because
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
um the ratio as you can see even when we
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
stress it done much it doesn't really
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
change that much so it's it's just a
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
matter of your decision so again we just
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
use this number to show how these
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
calculations will look like it is really
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
your policy decision how much you want
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
to authorize so
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
um I think when it starts when we need
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
to really start considering um you know
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
how the the true impact as we start
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
talking about approving an additional 50
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
million for example uh put a few extra
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
five or ten perhaps may not change the
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
calculation that much thank you thank
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you Treasurer I just
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand the 17
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
million uh that's already baked into the
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
debt in the same way that a lapse
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
extension is baked into prior
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
authorized debt so we don't have to
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
consider that we don't have to add that
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the to the number that that's in
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
section one
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
which is 120 almost 113 million so we
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be adding that we can go ahead
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
and authorize the 112 without worrying
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
about the 17
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
being added to it because it's already
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
baked in am I understanding that
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
correctly I believe that's that's how I
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
understand it as well it has been
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
authorized already and I believe it's
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
just being included this year as a
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
reminder that that was already
 
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:50.900 align:start position:0%
authorized in a previous budget
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
yes represent bark
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh I'm not
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
quite sure how to ask the question but
 
01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.770 align:start position:0%
quite sure how to ask the question but
as

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
we go through legislation that has or
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
will probably reduce revenues through
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
different bills and stuff that are uh
 
01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
in process as it goes does that have an
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
adverse effect to the debt limit that we
 
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:26.540 align:start position:0%
can carry through this RSA
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
6-c colon 2.
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question I think
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
obviously any any changes in revenues
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
will have
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh we'll change this calculation so
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it could be it could be some of the
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
changes that are being implemented it
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
could be an economic downturn so
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything that is um that would change
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
essentially the the denominator will uh
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
will impact this calculations so
 
01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:55.129 align:start position:0%
will impact this calculations so
um

01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
it is unclear how those changes I don't
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
believe that if you're talking about
 
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.290 align:start position:0%
believe that if you're talking about
Revenue

01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps some well just for instance if I
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
may miss a chairman
 
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.209 align:start position:0%
may miss a chairman
um

01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
like the gas tax there was a bill
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
floating around wanting to remove four
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
pennies per gallon there's removing the
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
communications tax their re you know
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's different things that are trying
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be implemented uh uh for tax savings
 
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that but does that come
 
01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:36.500 align:start position:0%
with a caveat of a
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
issue on the percentage of debt
 
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.750 align:start position:0%
issue on the percentage of debt
calculation

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
of that so the quick answer I think it
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
would be it could impact
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
um the calculations
 
01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:53.330 align:start position:0%
um the calculations
um

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
only if it impacts unrestricted Revenue
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
so for example if you're talking about
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
certain uh changes to
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
um the highway fine that will not impact
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
this calculation it only is
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
unrestrictive revenue anything that
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
impacts unrestricted Revenue could
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
potentially impact this calculation
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
um to that to the actual impact it's
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
unclear to me how how that it just comes
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
as a the overall package again of how
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
much unrestricted Revenue will change
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answer your question
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you any further
 
01:28:27.659 --> 01:28:30.770 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you any further
questions

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
seeing yes
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Malone thank you Mr
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for testifying
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
today so what's your uh assumption
 
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:44.900 align:start position:0%
regarding interest rates uh that's based
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
goes into these calculations here I see
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
the feds possibly going raising the
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
rates up to five and a quarter so could
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
you please talk about that thank you yes
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question um as
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely the the the
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
rate environment is changing is um so we
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're using um rates for tax and set
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
exempt bonds this is a municipal Market
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
but even the um the municipal Market
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
those interest rates are changing what's
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
the changes that the Federal Reserve is
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
is making oh you know a spot of again
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
increasing rate so
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so it does impact it does impact a
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
um the municipal bond market follows the
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
treasury market so um the yields are
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
increasing so we're looking at rates
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
right now and again it's this is this
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
changes it's all dependent of how the
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
market is performing but we're looking
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
at rates in the range of close to four
 
01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:46.010 align:start position:0%
at rates in the range of close to four
percent

01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um in in from what I hear from our
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
financial advisor is that perhaps we're
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
going to go back to times of uh you know
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
back in um prior to 2008 the rates were
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
about four percent in that you know
 
01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and they will probably stay
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
like that for some time so we'll see
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
this pressure you know we've been
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
borrowing really
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
um uh inexpensive we've been able to
 
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
um uh inexpensive we've been able to
borrow

01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
borrow
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
um it's been inexpensive to borrow in
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
the past so now we really have to
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
consider that as part of our overall
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
cost and again that's brought that's why
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
I wanted to include it in my
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
presentation and mention it just because
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
um it will impact
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
um our budgets you know how much we we
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
have been included in higher interest
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
rates in these calculations so
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
essentially it will it will certainly
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
impact our budgets current budgets and
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
upcoming budgets
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Abbott
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I just wondered
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
um under the credit ratings for the
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
state it has Moody's Fitch and standard
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
s p I recall from the last time we did
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
this capital budget and the lending that
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
there was some kind of difficulty with
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
standard and pause and has that been
 
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.189 align:start position:0%
standard and pause and has that been
resolved

01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
it has uh representative thanks for the
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
question and in the past there was this
 
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.550 align:start position:0%
question and in the past there was this
uh

01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the rating agency was just using what
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
we call all language and their you know
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
evaluation and they were using um
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
um that's part of what they were
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
um using as a foundation what they were
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
looking at the the in the treasures view
 
01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
it was it was seen as probably
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
inaccurate or older information they
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
were using for the analysis so
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
um it was about three years ago I think
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
we we met with them we explained to them
 
01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.129 align:start position:0%
we we met with them we explained to them
so

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
um they they have been obviously
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
consider our our feedback our input and
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
since then uh they've been more
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
um uh obviously uh using more relevant
 
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
information information that we share
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
with them they've been considering that
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
information and again um you know to to
 
01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:07.460 align:start position:0%
the point that they were able to change
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
the Outlook they they use their Outlook
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
as a as a way to see
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
if their look is stable then they say
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay well this you know this state or
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
this uh issuer is going to
 
01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:21.649 align:start position:0%
this uh issuer is going to
um

01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
I guess remain stable remain consistent
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
over time when they change the uh the um
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
when the changes are locked from stable
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
to positive there really is it really is
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
a sign that they perhaps considering an
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade so they're giving us some
 
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
conditions as to
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you know what they will do I guess
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
conditions if the state performance this
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
particular manner for example continue
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
adding to the rainy day fund continue
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
with The Debt Service um the debt
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
management practices you know certain
 
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing well and then
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know keep working on the things that
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're not doing as well they will
 
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
consider giving us an upgrade
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
um so so yes to answer your question yes
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
we have resolved that that you should do
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%

for facilities and administration over
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
at UNH so we have some material for you
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
we have a few slides to walk through
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
knock that we have more slides probably
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
than than we need to cover in a half an
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
hour but I'd like to just
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
um kind of remind members of the
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee who have been here for quite
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
some time and it sounds like you've
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
already spoken to the to the state
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
treasurer about the appropriation that
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
was made in 2019 on slide one we just
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
give the excerpt in 2019 the capital
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
budget provided for three biennium
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the University system
 
01:36:41.209 --> 01:36:41.219 align:start position:0%
which excuse me
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
has been extremely helpful in our
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
planning and what projects we can do in
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
what projects we can't do it's had a
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
meaningful impact on the our Capital
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
planning on on slide two
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
in the green columns this was the
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the state Appropriations
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
that were again were made in 2019 and
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
then the portion of those projects that
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
has been have been funded by the
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
university system and we made a
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
commitment at that time that if projects
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
went over
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
we were not going to come back and ask
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
for more money and you can imagine
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
over that time period with inflationary
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
pressures and supply chain issues we
 
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
have had especially at the biological
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
sciences initiative at UNH and Bill will
 
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
talk about that in just a minute
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
on slide three as you're well aware all
 
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:42.179 align:start position:0%
agencies are required to provide a
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
six-year Capital plan and so while the
 
01:37:50.649 --> 01:37:50.659 align:start position:0%
state request for fiscal years 24 and 25
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
is to remain where we um are right now
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
from the laws of 19 we have included
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
slide four I want to just um
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
inform the committee on the entirety of
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
the University Systems Capital plan the
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
state piece is impactful
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of the capital
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
dollars that are expended by the
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
university system on our Capital plan
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
our University system funded
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
um we we pretty much run three little
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
cities and with dorms and dining halls
 
01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:39.860 align:start position:0%
and academic buildings and
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
Athletics and all of that
 
01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.250 align:start position:0%
Athletics and all of that
um

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
the majority of the capital dollars are
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
funded by the university system so
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that pie chart shows and and
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
Gibson grants as well Gibson grants is
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the um the biological sciences
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
initiative at UNH is the largest Capital
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
project ever undertaken by the
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
university system and correct me if I'm
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
wrong I believe over the three biennium
 
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.070 align:start position:0%
wrong I believe over the three biennium
appropriation

01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
35 million of the 95 million dollar
 
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.110 align:start position:0%
35 million of the 95 million dollar
project

01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
is and was funded by state
 
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.370 align:start position:0%
is and was funded by state
Appropriations

01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
so I am going to let Bill Janelle talk
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
more about the the um the project itself
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Kathy uh good morning
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey and members of
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
the capital budget overview committee so
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
this biological sciences initiative is
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
essentially a renovation of Spalding
 
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
Hall in addition to Spaulding Hall the
 
01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
addition comprises about forty seven
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet and the renovation
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
is about 83 000 square feet and Spalding
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hall is a 1960s vintage science building
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
that we're upgrading to today's
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
standards so a few things that this
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
project will do number one it's going to
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
address significant deferred maintenance
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
in that building to the tune of about 30
 
01:40:02.169 --> 01:40:02.179 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
it will also increase enrollments in
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
these high demand science Fields it it
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
will upgrade our laboratory and teaching
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
spaces that again 1960s building doesn't
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
meet today's needs with the goal of
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
increasing Workforce the workforce in
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
this area for for many companies that
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
so just a quick overview of the project
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
and this I'm on page slaw page seven and
 
01:40:37.209 --> 01:40:37.219 align:start position:0%
that photo is a a picture of the Edition
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
so the project budget as Kathy said 95.5
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
million our architect is Ellen swag
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
Associates the construction manager is
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
skanska and the delivery method is
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
construction manager at risk
 
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:54.860 align:start position:0%
the project was started in September of
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
2019 and we started with the addition
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
which is Phase One and again I'm on
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
slide eight and if you look at the
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
schematic on that on that slide the
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
lower picture shows the blue area is
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually the addition and the tan area
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
is existing Spalding Hall and phase one
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
is the addition again which was it was
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
completed in April of 22 so roughly
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
about a year ago
 
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
we signed the guaranteed maximum price
 
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
in January of 21 for phase two which is
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
the renovation of Spalding Hall and that
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
work began in January of 20 of June of
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
22 I'm sorry and we're targeting
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
completion for spring of 2024 with
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
occupancy of the entire facility in the
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
fall of 2024. so this project again has
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
been going on since 2019 where we've
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
been building through the pandemic we've
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
certainly had some challenges as Kathy
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
said with materials and delays and we
 
01:41:58.810 --> 01:41:58.820 align:start position:0%
had to stop work at one point as well
 
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
but we do remain on budget and we've had
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
schedule has slipped a bit but only a
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
few months at this point and again we're
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking to occupy in the fall of 2024.
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
so on slide nine
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
the project will deliver 11 biological
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
science teaching labs and nine research
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
labs and accommodate an additional 50
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
principal researchers we're also
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
constructing a vivarium within the new
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
project so that's a housing for
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
laboratory animals rats and mice and
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
that the vivarium will also be completed
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time as the rest of the
 
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
project in Fall of 2024.
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
so on slide 10 these are just some
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
photos of work currently underway so
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
phase one that shows some of the lab
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
spaces that are completed and occupied
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
right now and in use
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
and phase two is below and this spring
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
we did a complete gut demolition of
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
Spalding Hall
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we did find more hazardous materials
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
asbestos mainly in that facility than we
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
were anticipated but we're continuing to
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
move forward with instructional
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
reinforcement complete replacement of
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
the mechanical electrical and plumbing
 
01:43:12.239 --> 01:43:13.609 align:start position:0%
the mechanical electrical and plumbing
systems

01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so it's underway and going well
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
there are I'm sure if if the committee
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
was ever interested I'm sure the
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
university would love to have you over
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
for a tour but
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
um there are also two impactful projects
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth and at Keene and Matt
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
Purcell is just going to briefly give
 
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:36.860 align:start position:0%
you an update on those
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning just to briefly update
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
you quickly if you don't know Plymouth
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
State University start off with Hyde
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hall it's a Hyde Hall is the primary
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
academic facility on that campus it was
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
built nearly 50 years ago in that
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
interim that many students have gone
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
through it and we're proposing to a
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
project there to address a lot of the
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
mechanical electrical problems in some
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the envelope issues that we have with
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
that building
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh currently anticipating it will
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
address at least 17 million dollars of
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Maintenance backlog in there as well
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
as creating and revitalizing the
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
business school and creating more of an
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
applied business approach uh for their
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
undergraduate and graduate student
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
programs there this is going to Prime
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the project is going to primarily focus
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
on the first and second floor although
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
the the maintenance or the mechanical
 
01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179 align:start position:0%
systems are going to address the entire
 
01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:34.310 align:start position:0%
systems are going to address the entire
building

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
building
the

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
intent of the creation of this
 
01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:39.659 align:start position:0%
Innovation Center on the first and
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
second floor of this business Innovation
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
Center is to make more connectivity with
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
the businesses within the North country
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
and to provide a greater diversity of
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
Workforce that will go directly into the
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
into the economy of New Hampshire
 
01:44:56.219 --> 01:44:57.169 align:start position:0%
into the economy of New Hampshire
um

01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're well underway on the project we
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
just completed the design last week and
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh have a
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
preliminary guaranteed maximum price
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
contract of 30 points well the total
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
project of 30.5 million dollars with a
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
with a guaranteed contract with a
 
01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:18.659 align:start position:0%
contractor uh Engelbert construction for
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
about 25 million dollars the uh
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
the architect on the project is a firm
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
out of Boston called goody Clancy
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
um right now we anticipate that we are
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
going to do a phased construction
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
starting with the fourth floor and
 
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
moving down to the first floor over 16
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
months starting in May and completing
 
01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:43.340 align:start position:0%
most of it in by the end September 2024.
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
right now it's uh
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's how we're going to sequence and
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
move all the students through the
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
building as one of our current Endeavors
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
right now and and be able to occupy it
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
and do the construction at the same time
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
next project is the Elliott Center down
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
at Keene State College right now we're
 
01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the procurement process of engaging a
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
a architectural firm it's going to be a
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
20 million dollar project which is going
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
to address the student services needs on
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
that campus Central centralizing them as
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
well as improving the admissions office
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
and and the supporting uh
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
building the Elliott was it used to be a
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
hospital the college
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
purchased it in 1971 did some minor
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
Renovations then uh has not had any
 
01:46:31.729 --> 01:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
major Renovations since that point in
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
time and this is going to address a
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
significant amount of the the
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance backlog in that facility and
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that we're going to start
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the construction of that in early summer
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
we were asked to include information on
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
any capital projects that were included
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. and so beginning on
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
slide 20
 
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.770 align:start position:0%
slide 20
.

01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
.
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
in section 10 of House Bill 2
 
01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
there is eight million dollars to be
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
funded I Believe by Sir Surplus in
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 to go toward the Whittemore
 
01:47:18.490 --> 01:47:18.500 align:start position:0%
Center at unh
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
and Bill can talk specifics about this
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
the governor believes that this is an
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
impact what we do do as well an
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
impactful project
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
the university has already invested
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
um heavily I think we replaced the
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
entire ice and everything underneath it
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the last couple years and then we're
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
now working on HVAC and
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so we also have they're also donors
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are willing to participate in the
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
project and so bill has more information
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
on the project itself
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
thanks Kathy
 
01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.689 align:start position:0%
thanks Kathy
um

01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay so if many folks I'm probably
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with the whitemore center but
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
this is the home of the men's and
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
women's hockey programs at UNH and also
 
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
the Northeast passage sled hockey team
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
at UNH which has produced many
 
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.609 align:start position:0%
at UNH which has produced many
paralympic

01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
paralympic
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
um athletes that go to to those games
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
but the project uh it's envisioned to
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
invest 30 million dollars into the
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center address deferred
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs and upgrade the
 
01:48:23.689 --> 01:48:23.699 align:start position:0%
facility to meet current standards the
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
improvements will bring the facility on
 
01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
par with other higher ed peers and also
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
allow for host additional utilization of
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
the facility in the spring summer and
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
fall of periods as well
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
and the funding as Kathy said
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at funding from UNH
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
private philanthropy and hopefully the
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
state as well
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
so on slide 21 and 22 we kind of break
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
up the different components and the
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
funding piece so unh's commitment is
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
about 13.7 million and there's two
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
pieces to that one is
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
um his work that's just been completed
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
is a 6.5 million dollar project where we
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
replaced the ice sheet so the the
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
concrete slab and Refrigeration under
 
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
the slab along with the ice making
 
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.290 align:start position:0%
the slab along with the ice making
equipment

01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the Dasher boards as well and also
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
the sound system which is will be
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
replaced this spring so that work is
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
just completing now UNH also has a
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
project to upgrade existing the existing
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
HVAC system and add air conditioning to
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
the rink level as well so that was never
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
installed when it was initially built in
 
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.090 align:start position:0%
installed when it was initially built in
1995.

01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:37.100 align:start position:0%
1995.
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
so the other components are to renovate
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
team spaces throughout the Whittemore
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
Center and also add a strength and
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
conditioning Center to the facility
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
and again this this would include locker
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
rooms for men's hockey women's hockey
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
field hockey as well and it would also
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
create a fully accessible locker room
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the north Northeast passage sled
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
hockey team
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
so on slide 23 just essentially gives
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
you a couple of schematics one at the
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
rink level where all that colored area
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
represent those team rooms and
 
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
conditioning spaces as well that would
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
be renovated as part of the project and
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
the lower
 
01:50:20.699 --> 01:50:21.410 align:start position:0%
the lower
um

01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
plan shows in addition in red which
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
would be the strength and conditioning
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
area that would be included as well and
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
on the right just provide some photos of
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
those spaces so on top that's a that's a
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
view of the back side of the Whittemore
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
Center where that strength and
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
conditioning area would be added and
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
we've got a photo of the locker rooms
 
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
and also the strength and conditioning
 
01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:44.090 align:start position:0%
and also the strength and conditioning
area

01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
and on slide 24
 
01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:47.629 align:start position:0%
and on slide 24
um

01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
the graph that's here essentially shows
 
01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.310 align:start position:0%
the graph that's here essentially shows
uh

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
where UNH stands with peers for strength
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
and conditioning space so we're
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
currently the lowest when when you look
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
at that space in itself the blue bar
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
just to the right of that will show
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
where UNH would be when this project
 
01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
would be complete so still kind of in
 
01:51:12.129 --> 01:51:12.139 align:start position:0%
the middle of the road where that line
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
is shown horizontally would be that
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
would be the center line
 
01:51:16.619 --> 01:51:18.169 align:start position:0%
would be the center line
um

01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a high level summary
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
and the only thing I'll add is
 
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
um the additional utilization of the
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
facility it's it's used for a high
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
school programs it's used for our
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
commencement we've hosted presidents
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
there as well so it's much more than
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
thank you all for the overview
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.330 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
um

01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to go back
 
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:52.940 align:start position:0%
um start back with a
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
Career technical schools
 
01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:12.110 align:start position:0%
um and others have partnered with
 
01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:12.590 align:start position:0%
um and others have partnered with
[Music]

01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:15.290 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.649 --> 01:52:17.659 align:start position:0%
with work Workforce
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
with business I'm thinking of the HVAC
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
program and specifically labs for that
 
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.870 align:start position:0%
program and specifically labs for that
purpose

01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
automotive and others you piqued my
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
interest when you spoke that you were
 
01:52:35.169 --> 01:52:35.179 align:start position:0%
going to be working with some of the uh
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
the tech leaders in our state and this
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
being part of that and could you tell me
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
or any or any of those
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh corporations working on this or any
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
of those corporations contributing money
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
and those corporations saying we have
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
such a need here that we are willing to
 
01:53:01.729 --> 01:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
help with labs and so forth or are we
 
01:53:01.739 --> 01:53:03.950 align:start position:0%
help with labs and so forth or are we
developing

01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
a program that works in general
 
01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.890 align:start position:0%
a program that works in general
everywhere

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
the one company that comes to mind is
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
lonza who we've worked with initially
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
they were here to even speak to this
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
project and they're looking to hire many
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the graduates and there is I believe
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
there is some funding coming from lonza
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
to support the project as well not to
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
the level of completing an entire lab
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
space but there is Select funding within
 
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
the project for that purpose but that's
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
the one that comes to mind where they
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
have you know Pharmaceuticals and by and
 
01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
have you know Pharmaceuticals and by and
biology

01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
students that they'd look to bring on
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
board thank you for that so our once
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
this lab's finished and this will be a
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
great Jewel for the University
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
what sort of work will you be doing
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
there and do we have any thoughts as are
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
we training
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
are we gaining Prestige by having this
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
facility or are we training people to go
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
work throughout the country and not in
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
so I uh let me answer your first
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Conte I think
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
it absolutely will bring Prestige not to
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
just the university but to the state
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
um our peers around around New England
 
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
are investing in these same types of
 
01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.729 align:start position:0%
are investing in these same types of
facilities

01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
we I can tell you that
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
our students that participate in
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
internships are twice as likely to stay
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
and work here
 
01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:44.219 align:start position:0%
and the university has invested heavily
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
they call it caps career and
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a career advising placement
 
01:54:52.679 --> 01:54:54.950 align:start position:0%
it's it's a career advising placement
office

01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
um there are more internship
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities available now to UNH
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
students than actually students
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
actually part of our operating request I
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
know this is capital is to invest in
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
those same types of efforts at Plymouth
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and Keene to really ramp up internship
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
Business Partnership so I will say that
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely we hope to keep our graduates
 
01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.350 align:start position:0%
absolutely we hope to keep our graduates
working

01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
staying here in New Hampshire
 
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
staying here in New Hampshire
um

01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
but that's not just a university system
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
effort right that's an effort on the
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
part of
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
business and state and the university
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
system in keeping our students here
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think what it will do is attract
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
students here that might not have
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise been attracted to
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
UNH again as as UVM and UMass and UConn
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
have invested in these same types of
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
facilities this will be an attraction
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
and you know we can have a discussion
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
about in-state versus out-of-state
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
students we're about 50 50 but when you
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
think of 50 out of state 50 in state
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
when you think about that we're we're
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
like one of the number one attractors of
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
Young Talent into New Hampshire from out
 
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
of state as we try to keep our New
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students here as well so I
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
think it's incumbent upon all of us
 
01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:29.219 align:start position:0%
collectively to do everything we can to
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
keep those students
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
working and staying and living here
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
after they graduate sorry if I that was
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
probably a lengthy too lengthy of a
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
response thank you
 
01:56:45.609 --> 01:56:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you chairman a lot of
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
projects so explain the projects well
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
when we talk about hvacs and mechanical
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
and energy systems that we
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
are we doing some efficiencies in those
 
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.850 align:start position:0%
are we doing some efficiencies in those
upgrades

01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
um any Renewables geothermal stuff like
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
that by chance in in your effort
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
you want to take that yes so
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
um definitely looking at efficiencies as
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
part of these upgrades we have building
 
01:57:18.169 --> 01:57:18.179 align:start position:0%
automation building automation system
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
that looks at the entire campus as well
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
where we would install controls in
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
individual buildings throughout campus
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
that then we can view as part of the
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
building automation systems to make sure
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're running it appropriately but as
 
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
far as renewals go Renewables go
 
01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:36.070 align:start position:0%
far as renewals go Renewables go
UNH

01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
UNH
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
we actually have our own co-generation
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
facility at UNH you may be aware of that
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
we bring in landfill gas from TurnKey
 
01:57:45.729 --> 01:57:45.739 align:start position:0%
landfill we generate our own electricity
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
and heat as well we have a district
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
heating system across campus and that's
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
we we generate about 80 percent of the
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
electricity that we use through our own
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
through the landfill gas and
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
cogeneration and Heat's kind of a
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
byproduct of that of that process to
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
generate electricity that we then
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
distribute across campus in our district
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
heating system that heats many of the
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
facilities including the Whittemore yeah
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you any
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
I thank you so much for attending today
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.129 --> 01:58:25.139 align:start position:0%
we will move to the Liquor Commission in
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up with the
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee to representative Jack's
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
question earlier around the um
 
01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.729 align:start position:0%
question earlier around the um
appropriation

01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
University system appropriation was made
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't going to be effective
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
until 24-25 so the number of the 113
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
number that representative Jack
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned you need to add the 17 to that
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the total new
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for 24 would be the 113
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
plus 17 which is a it's about 129
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
million in change is what you see I just
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't want members to think that you
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
only had 113 budgeted and that you could
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
go to 120. that you you've already
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
exceeded the 120 with the UNH money and
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
the money that the governor has
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Shea any questions of Mr
 
01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
Shea what he just told us
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
that being the case I'm glad I asked the
 
01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:42.169 align:start position:0%
that being the case I'm glad I asked the
question

01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
that we could encumber in the future
 
02:01:03.659 --> 02:01:23.390 align:start position:0%
that we could encumber in the future
yeah

02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
we will now move on to the Liquor
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%

committee
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh on page two you'll see a summary of
 
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
our requests in the governor's capital
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget we have three requests the first
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
one is our Hampton North and South new
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
stores for 13.78 million the second is a
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
headquarters Life Safety Improvement for
 
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
2.4 million and the third is a roof
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
replacement at our Keen liquor store for
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
220 000. however we do have one other
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
project that was not included in the
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget that we would like the
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee to consider consider
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that is 1.5 million for our computer
 
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
software upgrade called the 365 and I
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
will explain those on each of the coming
 
02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.510 align:start position:0%
will explain those on each of the coming
slides

02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide number one is our
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampton North and South new stores this
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
request is for additional funds
 
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
necessary to construct two new 20 to 22
 
02:02:58.129 --> 02:02:58.139 align:start position:0%
000 square foot retail outlets on I-95
 
02:02:59.330 --> 02:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
in Hampton
 
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
we originally requested 14 million uh
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
and that was all based on the FY 1819
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
budget the additional funds requested
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
here are based on current rates provided
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
by DPW
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
the current status of the project we
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
continue to work with our business
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
partners relative to existing title
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
issues in advance of issuing an RFP to
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
sell and develop the property most
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
recently we requested a change to the
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
Wetland delineation with des and then
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
working with the town of Hampton
 
02:03:35.209 --> 02:03:35.219 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission they hired a
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
wetland scientist to verify our
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
submitted plans and the town Wetland
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%

02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
so the additional time and expenses
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
resulting from The Unexpected due
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
diligence combined with the substantial
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
increases in building materials Fuel and
 
02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
availability of construction related
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
labor has yielded escalations of all
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
aspects of the project financially in
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
very significant terms so we originally
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
requested about 7.5 million for the
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
project and DPW added
 
02:04:34.129 --> 02:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
6.3 million to our estimates bringing
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
the total request to the 13.78 for a
 
02:04:40.330 --> 02:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
total for the project of
 
02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
27.78 million
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
I know that in the DPW estimates 3
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
million was for increases in cost but
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
there was also 3 million for inflation
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
okay our second project is our
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
headquarters Life Safety Improvement our
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
headquarters facility is 60 years old we
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
have some life safety and a small
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
renovation for office space that we're
 
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
requesting it's to replace Warehouse bay
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
doors 10 roll-up doors and connecting
 
02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
them to the fire alarm because they
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
presently don't meet code and they were
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
noted in the Fire Marshal's annual
 
02:05:22.729 --> 02:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
inspection we also have four exterior
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
Freight Bay roll-up doors that need to
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
be replaced replacing our building
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
security which is past its useful life
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
and is no longer supported
 
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
supplement for our FY 1819 appropriation
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
for our parking lot Rehabilitation since
 
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
the original funding we have found that
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
there are issues with the sewer line
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
catch basins infiltration system and
 
02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
there's some infrastructure repairs that
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
need to be done under the parking lot
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
and then have it repaved so we're
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
requesting additional funds for that
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then a possible roof replacement for
 
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
the section of our roof that was
 
02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
replaced in 2017
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
the roof was leaking when we put in our
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
original capital request but it has
 
02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
since been repaired as part of the
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
warranty so at this point we're not sure
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be replaced or if the
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
patch is actually or the repair is
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
actually worked so with the unknown of
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
the roof replacement we're requesting to
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
add to this request a small renovation
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
for our office space we originally
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
requested this in our phase that was not
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
approved in the governor's budget
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
so in the event that funding is
 
02:06:35.639 --> 02:06:36.609 align:start position:0%
so in the event that funding is
available

02:06:36.609 --> 02:06:36.619 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
without having to do the roof we'd like
 
02:06:42.370 --> 02:06:42.380 align:start position:0%
to do a small 2200 square foot
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
renovation taking some of our warehouse
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
space for additional personnel and to
 
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
safely space out workstations
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
and that request is the 2.4 million
 
02:06:59.089 --> 02:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
our third item is our Keen Outlet roof
 
02:06:59.099 --> 02:07:00.589 align:start position:0%
our third item is our Keen Outlet roof
replacement

02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
um this was built the store was built in
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
2005 but it has been determined that the
 
02:07:08.330 --> 02:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
roof was not properly installed uh it
 
02:07:10.609 --> 02:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
leaks into the store and it needs to be
 
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
replaced the we found that it wasn't
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
prepared finished or sealed to the
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
industry standard and that request is
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
for 220 000.
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
and then the request that wasn't
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
included in the governor's budget is a
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
request for the d365 so we're in the
 
02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
process of replacing all point of sale
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
software hardware and back office
 
02:07:34.689 --> 02:07:34.699 align:start position:0%
computer systems
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
this funding would supplement for the
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
contracts related to the project and
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
possible enhancements or changes to the
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
system and additional equipment should
 
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
the needs a need arise after we go live
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
it would allow the commission to
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
implement enhancements that would
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
improve efficiency and increase Revenue
 
02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
the d365 implementation requires
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
additional funds due to delays in
 
02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
testing and this is caused by blackout
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
dates for liquor operations and the
 
02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
state financials so the funding would
 
02:08:11.570 --> 02:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
um to revise the contract with Accenture
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
who is the contractor doing the
 
02:08:15.719 --> 02:08:16.930 align:start position:0%
who is the contractor doing the
implementation

02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:16.940 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
for additional cut over support to
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
resolve integration issues to work with
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
Microsoft to resolve some persistent
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
software update issues and for
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
additional performance testing it's also
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
recommended that we conduct a
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
third-party security audit and the funds
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
will support that so in the agency
 
02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement request the
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
commission requested a million dollars
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
for an emergency fund and a million
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
dollars for this computer software
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
upgrade and we're at now asking for 1.5
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
million for this project and not asking
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
for the emerge agency funds
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
and those whoops yep those are all our
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
projects and we'll be happy to answer
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
um I'll ask first
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
so you're you're one and your one
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
million dollar request is from your
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund the liquor funds or is
 
02:09:22.609 --> 02:09:22.619 align:start position:0%
that from the state for general fund and
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
or bonding
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
um all of our requests are 100 liquor
 
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
funded beginning an Enterprise fund we
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
will fund all of the bonds
 
02:09:37.250 --> 02:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
your thank you so your point of sale I
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
believe we've talked about that several
 
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
times for years and years
 
02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:43.250 align:start position:0%
times for years and years
um

02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:47.209 --> 02:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
and um you just elaborate is is this an
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
upgrade to an upgrade or we had not
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point that you've expended
 
02:09:54.410 --> 02:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
the funds for your point of sale just
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
give me a background please sure it's an
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing project the the system that the
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission runs on now is called
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
mapper it's about 35 years old and it's
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
always been run it's an in-house program
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
it was designed and developed and
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
implemented by The Liquor Commission of
 
02:10:16.669 --> 02:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
35 36 years ago so all the expenses
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
around running that program have been
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
in-house and what we're doing is
 
02:10:25.689 --> 02:10:25.699 align:start position:0%
upgrading the system to a Microsoft
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
t365 system so it's more compatible with
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
the software and Hardware that's out
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
there today the system that we run on is
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
is a very obviously Antiquated system
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
and when we do a changeover like this
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's probably a reason it
 
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done for 35 years because
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's a massive undertaking you're
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
changing everything that the Liquor
 
02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
Commission runs on so we are obviously
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
very cautious and very careful as we go
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
through this because it could affect
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
revenues and that's the last thing that
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
we want this change to do
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the new members perhaps
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
you could explain
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
um when you have renovated stores or
 
02:11:08.649 --> 02:11:08.659 align:start position:0%
built new stores
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping this number stays there
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that it usually equates to a higher
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of sales out of that property
 
02:11:19.729 --> 02:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
could you could you address that for the
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
new members certainly well when we
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
renovate these these Pro these
 
02:11:27.169 --> 02:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
properties obviously we've we've closed
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
a number of properties over the years
 
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
due to a number of reasons mainly
 
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
Staffing and stores that we considered
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
to be underperforming so as you've seen
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years we've created a
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
brand we've created us an essential look
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
and feel for how we want this business
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
to look and we've taken that forward uh
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the last 12 years the prophet that we
 
02:11:58.850 --> 02:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
see as we gain the square footage is
 
02:12:02.169 --> 02:12:02.179 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 12 and 30 percent
 
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
depending on what store and and how we
 
02:12:08.209 --> 02:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
do it even though we have less stores
 
02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
today than we did originally when I'd
 
02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
started at The Liquor Commission we have
 
02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:18.020 align:start position:0%
12 or 13 Less stores we have about
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
300 260
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
000 additional square footage so we when
 
02:12:26.050 --> 02:12:26.060 align:start position:0%
we when we
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
consolidate or build a new store we're
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
building it on a larger footprint for a
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
number of reasons first and foremost
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our business comes from
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales and in Massachusetts
 
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
in 2016 governor Patrick signed a bill
 
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
into law that allowed licensees in
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to hold more than three
 
02:12:52.729 --> 02:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
licenses and when he made that change
 
02:12:56.089 --> 02:12:56.099 align:start position:0%
that attracted Total Wine and Spirits to
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
come to Massachusetts Total Wine and
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
Spirits is the largest liquor privately
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
owned liquor wholesaler a re I'm sorry
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
retailer of wine and spirits in the
 
02:13:09.490 --> 02:13:09.500 align:start position:0%
United States they're in
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
27 States and they have 245 stores and
 
02:13:15.069 --> 02:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
do about
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
about three and a half billion dollars
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
in business they have 11 000 employees
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so since that time they have built six
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
stores in Massachusetts
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh understanding that the market was
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
woefully underserved there
 
02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
they've put in six stores and they're
 
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
planning to build two more Costco is
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
planning to build another two in
 
02:13:41.689 --> 02:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts this year BJ's is planning
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
to build another one store and Market
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
baskets as you may or may not know in
 
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts has gotten into
 
02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
the liquor business in a business they
 
02:13:53.689 --> 02:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
call MB spirits
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
so the competition that drives the
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to do what it does
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
every day is is based on what we see
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
happening across our borders and
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
protecting that 50 percent of sales that
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jack uh thank you MRN
 
02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:16.619 align:start position:0%
uh if the chair will indulged me there's
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of different areas I want to
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
get into the first is uh if we were to
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
approve the item number four are we
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
confident that the liquor fund will
 
02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
absorb the additional Debt Service it's
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
not clear to me why the governor didn't
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
include it
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh but yes we will we will be able to
 
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
fund it okay and uh second line of
 
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:39.950 align:start position:0%
fund it okay and uh second line of
questions

02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:40.609 align:start position:0%
questions
um

02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
the um the scope of the headquarters
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
project seems to be a little bit
 
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:46.850 align:start position:0%
project seems to be a little bit
different

02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lapse for
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh Concord headquarters roof replacement
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
and parking lot out of an abundance of
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
caution we may want to amend the purpose
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
on that so that it can cover this other
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
work that you want to do
 
02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.219 --> 02:15:10.250 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:14.810 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
under your life safety improvements I I
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
have a question on the
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
section of roof that was replaced in
 
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:24.950 align:start position:0%
section of roof that was replaced in
2017

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
2017
 
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:26.990 align:start position:0%
2017
um

02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
how a design materials and installers
 
02:15:37.970 --> 02:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
were selected if it failed and
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
and you had problems getting it taken
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
care of apparently there was no warranty
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh no the when representative it went
 
02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
through an RFP process and the installer
 
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:53.060 align:start position:0%
during the time
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
since the installation has gone out of
 
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
business so we had some back and forth
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
with the manufacturer of the product and
 
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
they have agreed to send another one of
 
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
their licensed installers to do the
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
repair which has been done
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
and now we are just concerned that there
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
may be other areas that this original
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
installer that is now defunct may have
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
not done the right amount of work to or
 
02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
done it properly so we're concerned that
 
02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
there may be additional problems in that
 
02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:30.530 align:start position:0%
there may be additional problems in that
area

02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.169 --> 02:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
aware of the rfps that were that were
 
02:16:36.179 --> 02:16:37.370 align:start position:0%
aware of the rfps that were that were
done

02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
do you are there people that oversee the
 
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
whole thing though so that
 
02:16:46.490 --> 02:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
a company might go out of business but
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
the material used would have some
 
02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
the material used would have some
um

02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
as you said the manufacturer took care
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
of of some part of it so going forward
 
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
how do you look to eliminate these
 
02:17:04.969 --> 02:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
situations well uh Public Works oversees
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
all the commissions projects so
 
02:17:10.129 --> 02:17:10.139 align:start position:0%
everything that we do construction wise
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
is overseen by uh whether it's a
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
building that we build like the Hampton
 
02:17:19.969 --> 02:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
buildings or the Hooksett buildings or
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
the parking lot or the The Roof Is All
 
02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
overseen by BPW so they kind of guide us
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
as to
 
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
where to go
 
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
and just just one last follow-up yes yes
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
and uh to the item about infrastructure
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
repairs under your parking lot
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
is that something are those something
 
02:17:46.009 --> 02:17:46.019 align:start position:0%
different than running into catch basins
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and curbing things
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
as the area of the parking lots have
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
failed there's a section of the parking
 
02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
lot in front of the bay doors where the
 
02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
tractor trailers roll over every day
 
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
there's some catch basins and drainage
 
02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
there that DPW has found out have are
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
failing underneath the ground and we've
 
02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
done a couple of uh
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
quick repairs there but that whole area
 
02:18:16.089 --> 02:18:16.099 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
excavated the pipes underneath replaced
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
so that's again it's 1965 that it was
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
done so it is failing
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh the question I have is on the
 
02:18:40.370 --> 02:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
computer software uh on item four
 
02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:41.389 align:start position:0%
computer software uh on item four
um

02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
does this money just cover the software
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
or does the current uh
 
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
sales equipment in the stores operate
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
off of this software because
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
or is that something that's going to
 
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
need to as a separate expenditure be
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
kind of unclear
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
the the expenditure for the the hardware
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
pieces the the swipe cards the uh
 
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
computer systems the cash drawers that
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
money has been expended already and as
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
part of the project and those pieces of
 
02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:21.260 align:start position:0%
equipment have been
 
02:19:24.169 --> 02:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
filtered out into the stores as the old
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
pieces of equipment have been have have
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
failed so this is this additional money
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for
 
02:19:37.209 --> 02:19:37.219 align:start position:0%
is just for
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
software implementation or upgrades in
 
02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
the software and some additional as you
 
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
go through a project this this large you
 
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
get to a point where you say oh we this
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
is maybe something that we should have
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
looked at and should have done there's
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
an upgrade that's now available that
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't available when d365 first came
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
out and we're trying to take advantage
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
of those upgrades so when we do roll
 
02:20:07.849 --> 02:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
this out to the stores we have that
 
02:20:11.889 --> 02:20:11.899 align:start position:0%
system in place with all the uh
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
accoutrement that's available at that
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
time there's a there's a lot of things
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that this system that we have now simply
 
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
cannot do uh discounting discounting in
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
the stores you may have noticed in some
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the stores now we have uh
 
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
electronic tags on the Shelf rather than
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
a paper tag so rather than those
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
employees having to print out tags every
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
month walk around the store and re-tag
 
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
we can now from a computer simply change
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
every single price at this at the drop
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
of a button so all those Savings in man
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
hours and paper and implementation are
 
02:20:55.969 --> 02:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
now things that we can do electronically
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
Juan Paulo
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
now does this incorporate also the
 
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
servers that run all this large
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
operation across the state or has that
 
02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:07.969 align:start position:0%
operation across the state or has that
been

02:21:07.969 --> 02:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:21:10.610 --> 02:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
function with it also well the new
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
system the old system is servers that
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
are either at doit at Hazen or at the
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and the new system is
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
completely cloud-based so everything
 
02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
will be done in the cloud
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Eaton
 
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
please just unfollow up on that I'm
 
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
assuming everything that's in the I.T
 
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
Spectrum goes through review Dennis
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
Gillette absolutely great we work hand
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
in hand he's actually on our executive
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee as is commissioner Bailey and
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus right and
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
going back to commissioner arlinghaus
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
the king store it's new in my mind my
 
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
turn my years
 
02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
turn my years
um

02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody did not meet industry
 
02:21:55.610 --> 02:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
standards do we have any recourse to go
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
back after that contractor and if not as
 
02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
admin services and Public Works been
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
made aware that she had a contractor
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
that was operating substandard so that
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need to continue them to be
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
available in the future bidding
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
processes the answer is yes to both of
 
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
those representative thank you thank you
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Juris thank you chair
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
the national location at exit 6 is it is
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
a lead certified building and I was put
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
up like what eight nine years ago and
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious with the new stores
 
02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
will that type of construction go into
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
effect with any other kind of um
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know possibly heating type systems
 
02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
like geothermal or photovoltaics you've
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
got a roof project going on too anything
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
like that in mind that that building is
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
one of the nine state-owned buildings
 
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives so we we don't own all
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
of our buildings but the one in Nashua
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's Lee gold certified is a
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
state-owned building a lot of the
 
02:22:56.210 --> 02:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
buildings that we're doing now for
 
02:22:59.330 --> 02:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
example in the new one in Nashua is a
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
Market Basket project the new one at
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
exit 17 is a is a privately owned
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
project so we and we have solar at the
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
project in in Concord we encourage the
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
landlords to do that but they're not our
 
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
properties they are they are leased
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
properties at this point
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up Chad yes thank
 
02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
you so on the thank you for that and
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
in my neighborhood there was a location
 
02:23:30.530 --> 02:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
closed at the 300 Main Street it's the
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
small store about maybe the size of this
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
this room
 
02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
um are we is from your from your
 
02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:39.010 align:start position:0%
um are we is from your from your
presentation

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:39.020 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
for my recollection there's also a
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
similar size store in a Plaza on Danny
 
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
Webster maybe heading into Merrimack
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's near the Market Basket as well
 
02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh that might be in Merrimack but uh are
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
those locations closing down and being
 
02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
and and the local customers being asked
 
02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
to to go to the to the bigger almost big
 
02:24:02.330 --> 02:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
box type stores
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
well uh what we've done over the years
 
02:24:08.450 --> 02:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
is try to represent the business as a
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
with a certain look and feel and a
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
certain brand and we certainly uh don't
 
02:24:16.429 --> 02:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
want customers to come to a store that's
 
02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
underwhelming and we certainly don't
 
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
want the customers to come to a store
 
02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
that doesn't carry the plethora of
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
product that our competition carries so
 
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
we try to build these stores with what
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
we call a a 60 40 mix of wine and
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
spirits and around 11
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
000 skus so that's 11
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
000 different individual items that are
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
carried in the store we tend to see that
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
you need to have somewhere between nine
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
thousand and ten thousand square feet in
 
02:24:51.290 --> 02:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
order to do that uh the the folks that
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
come from out of state when they shop
 
02:24:55.849 --> 02:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
locally out of state they're shopping in
 
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
big box stores so I I think that our
 
02:25:02.770 --> 02:25:02.780 align:start position:0%
mindset is to be able to
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
compete or compete and or exceed those
 
02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
expectations when consumers come here
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
rather than being in the dog leg of a
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
Plaza in an old store that might only
 
02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
have three or four thousands cues half
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
of what they'd expect in an old store
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to upgrade these stores so
 
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
we have taken the stores
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
for let's just use Dairy for instance we
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
had taken the store away from dairy
 
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
itself downtown Dairy we opened a store
 
02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry on exit four and at Exit
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
5. we have now gone back and addressed
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
the need for a store in Derry which will
 
02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
be opening in April because we've been
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
able to find that nine or ten thousand
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
square foot Sweet Spot in order to build
 
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
that store so some of the stores that
 
02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
have gone away have been Consolidated
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
with bigger stores and some of the
 
02:25:59.090 --> 02:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
stores that have gone away will come
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
back with larger locations as we find
 
02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
those locations
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you thank you
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
yes please representative
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you guys
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I see in your headquarters Life
 
02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
Safety improvements
 
02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
fire doors that don't meet code I I
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
would assume that they were built to
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
code at the time
 
02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
02:26:26.330 --> 02:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
could I assume that there's not
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
grandfathering anymore
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
they were this was brought to our
 
02:26:34.429 --> 02:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
attention by the fire marshal during an
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
inspection that these doors were no
 
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
longer up to code so they may have been
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
grandfathered for a certain period of
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
time but given that the building was
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
built in 65 these doors believe me look
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
to be original
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
and some of them don't work that's we're
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
just following with the with the what
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
they've asked us to do the fire marshal
 
02:26:59.530 --> 02:26:59.540 align:start position:0%
has asked us to do
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
please uh Sun something else I see this
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
100 liquor funds
 
02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
is that a like an account is that a
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes being an Enterprise fund we're
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
self-funded so our profits
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
um maintain our operations and our
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
overall profit is transferred to the
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's not retained there then no no okay
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:27:31.610 --> 02:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
Kaczynski uh I have one one further
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
question going back to the Hampton North
 
02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
and South new stores
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
looks like the project uh had a
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
RFQ for 2021 but we're out to 2023 and
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
part of that delay was over a wetland
 
02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
delineation correct and that you were
 
02:27:52.969 --> 02:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
um then I'm assuming instead of using
 
02:27:57.530 --> 02:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
the Departments people with their
 
02:27:58.969 --> 02:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
delineation you brought in another
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
expert and then everyone agreed that
 
02:28:04.969 --> 02:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
that was sufficient that there might
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
have been some misalignment of that
 
02:28:09.889 --> 02:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
mapping how how much of a delay did that
 
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
cost your project
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
Ballpark and money
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
did it delay your project by two years
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
and if I could follow up on that
 
02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
when when you propose a new project that
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
goes through Public Works I would
 
02:28:32.809 --> 02:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
imagine it does and Public Works is
 
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
accustomed to using Des to do the
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
mapping apparently we can have that
 
02:28:38.929 --> 02:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
conversation after but
 
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.610 --> 02:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
yes please Mike go ahead oh thank you Mr
 
02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
yes please Mike go ahead oh thank you Mr
chairman

02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm from Hampton so some of this
 
02:28:59.809 --> 02:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
interests me so I ask you a quick the uh
 
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
Delaney tried to build it on had certain
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on it when you were
 
02:29:05.809 --> 02:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
planning on building on it right and you
 
02:29:07.849 --> 02:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
had to go through a process to
 
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
get things changed that's correct
 
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so I assumed it with
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
the the new delineations or whatever it
 
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
is if I could please please thank you
 
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
um that there are certain stipulations
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be restrictions with
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
the when you go and put this out for bid
 
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
as far as what can be built and where it
 
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
can be built and absolutely there will
 
02:29:32.929 --> 02:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
be and and the town is now in agreement
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
with the state and the Liquor Commission
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
as to the wetlands delineation there was
 
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
some acreage years ago when it was first
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
done that were considered Wetlands that
 
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
are no longer wet so we are we are now
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
in agreement and and have a letter from
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
the town as of last week stating as such
 
02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:54.290 --> 02:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
um seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
so much for coming thank you very much
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
checks everything else
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay seems almost appropriate that we
 
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
would finish our morning with fish and
 
02:30:37.370 --> 02:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
game ahead of lunch
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
and um I'm assuming Mr Mason
 
02:30:43.849 --> 02:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sir would you please
 
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
present your fish and game proposal
 
02:30:49.090 --> 02:30:49.100 align:start position:0%
uh good morning chairman
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
McConkey and committee members I'd like
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
to thank you for the opportunity present
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
our capital budget item today my name is
 
02:30:57.889 --> 02:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
Scott Mason I'm the executive director
 
02:30:58.969 --> 02:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
02:30:58.979 --> 02:31:00.110 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Fish and Game
department

02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
this year we have just one request for
 
02:31:05.809 --> 02:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
355 thousand dollars to replace the roof
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
at our headquarters building
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
our headquarters roof has been leaking
 
02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
for several years now it has come to the
 
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
end of its life
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
um we are at this point we are now
 
02:31:19.309 --> 02:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
having damage to our ceiling tiles and
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
Carpeting and the insulation under the
 
02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
roof liner has buckled and needs to be
 
02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:27.050 align:start position:0%
roof liner has buckled and needs to be
replaced

02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a pretty straightforward and I
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
do apologize
 
02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
um although this is my second time
 
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
before capital budget committee my first
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
time we were in a zoom meeting structure
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
and um it's just hard to learn through
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
the zoom meeting so for all practical
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
purposes this is kind of my first trip
 
02:31:44.330 --> 02:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
through and I apologize for not bringing
 
02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
any written documentation
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're fine sir
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent me I guess my question is
 
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
has this been brought forward earlier
 
02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:01.429 align:start position:0%
has this been brought forward earlier
because

02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
with what you're describing you're not
 
02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
looking at just the damage you're
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
looking at possibility of mold and other
 
02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
issues by having this protracted for so
 
02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:11.330 align:start position:0%
issues by having this protracted for so
long

02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
um no this is the first time we've
 
02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
brought this issue forward
 
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:16.030 align:start position:0%
brought this issue forward
um

02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
I can only say that it's been leaking
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
for about two years I personally have no
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge beyond that as far as whether
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
it was leaking before or not I haven't
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you further question
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
02:32:40.730 --> 02:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
um this is the item that you just
 
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
brought for us there's one of them
 
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
of several actually that you that were
 
02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
on the list of things you were hoping
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
for do you want to speak to any of the
 
02:32:53.929 --> 02:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
other issues here
 
02:32:53.939 --> 02:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
other issues here

02:32:56.330 --> 02:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
the only one that I was prepared to
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
speak on was the one that was approved
 
02:32:59.690 --> 02:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
by the governors as part of the
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget
 
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:09.540 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%

so if I if I could sir so you're only
 
02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
you're only bringing forward the one
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
project that's in the capital proposal
 
02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:23.030 align:start position:0%
project that's in the capital proposal
and

02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%

um you'd rather not elaborate at this
 
02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
time well what I would like to do
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
um there was an item uh two years ago as
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
part of our capital budget item on the
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
hatcheries it was a 4.6 million dollar
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget item I believe it's uh
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and that was as I say it was for 4.6
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
million it was originally approved for
 
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
us to spend 4.6 million at just the
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill Hatchery and as that project
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
has developed the governor has expanded
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
it into looking at our entire system and
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
I would like to amend the work that you
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
folks did two years ago to allow us to
 
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
spend that 4.6 million on any of our
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
hatcheries where it's best suited to be
 
02:34:20.399 --> 02:34:21.590 align:start position:0%
hatcheries where it's best suited to be
used

02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:34:24.650 --> 02:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're currently in a um we're doing an
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
engineering study of our complete
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hatchery system we haven't quite
 
02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
finished it yet and unfortunately by the
 
02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
time we get that finished and come up
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
with our plan uh this committee will be
 
02:34:36.650 --> 02:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
done its work and and I'm
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
um preemptively asking for this even
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
though I don't necessarily have a plan
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
on spending it someplace else but I I
 
02:34:44.210 --> 02:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
would like that flexibility as part of
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
our overall Hatchery development
 
02:34:50.690 --> 02:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
um go ahead if I could thank you so um
 
02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
item 99 uh you'd like to amend to
 
02:34:59.210 --> 02:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
Statewide Fish Hatchery improvements
 
02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
correct and the amount of money that you
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
have in that appropriation you think
 
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
will suffice
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
until we're done the actual finish with
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
a study I can't sit here and tell you
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
whether it will or it won't I can tell
 
02:35:13.490 --> 02:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
you that the governor and
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
um has put
 
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
58.55 million in the Gopher funding for
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
us so this will push us over 60 million
 
02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
dollars so at this time that's what our
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
ask is
 
02:35:28.250 --> 02:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and we will as I say when we complete
 
02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
the study we'll be able to have a much
 
02:35:31.490 --> 02:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
harder figure
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
and and the other laps you have is
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
building security and fire safety
 
02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
improvements and and we'll continue that
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
and that correct I know and I apologize
 
02:35:44.570 --> 02:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
I um did not uh
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't able to research it before
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
today's hearing I know we've spent some
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
money out of that fund and I know
 
02:35:52.849 --> 02:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
currently right now we are actively
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
looking at replacing the sprinkler
 
02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
system at our new Hampton regional
 
02:35:58.490 --> 02:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
office and also at our Durham Regional
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
Office the New Hampton regional office
 
02:36:04.010 --> 02:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
we've done the main lines already and we
 
02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
need to do the lateral lines and the
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
head at new in Durham we're going to
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
need to do the entire system well that's
 
02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
not actually due until next week so okay
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
so you're fine on your deliverable
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please represent Bart uh
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm just curious why the
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
roof wouldn't know went through the
 
02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
public works uh portion of the budget
 
02:36:30.050 --> 02:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
allocation for
 
02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
this the
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
because it's like 355
 
02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
000 and my curiosity also falls under
 
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
will it get done this year or within the
 
02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
next year and see
 
02:36:49.490 --> 02:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
if Public Works does it does it fall
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
into the bucket requirements no the
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
buckets yes
 
02:36:59.809 --> 02:36:59.819 align:start position:0%
I I I'm sorry Mr commissioner it's uh we
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh we've had discussion on the back on
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
how long a roof uh is leaking and how
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
many buckets it takes to contain that
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
leak and so I think that was a little
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
Insider on what we were well we're using
 
02:37:12.889 --> 02:37:12.899 align:start position:0%
a trash can the trash can
 
02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
so we'll Define it to TC or something
 
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on the uh two hundred
 
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
um for Hatchery infrastructure
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
improvements uh um it's written here
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative projects include
 
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
replacing failing septic systems well
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
pumps roofs so forth
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
this will re this request would allow
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
the department to respond in a in a more
 
02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
if you've got a failing septic system at
 
02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
what point
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
is it determined by
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
you that it is failed and if it fails
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
then what's the plan correct
 
02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:07.070 align:start position:0%
then what's the plan correct
um

02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries have
 
02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:11.929 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries have
um

02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily had the improvements
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they should have had over the
 
02:38:17.090 --> 02:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements they should have
 
02:38:18.429 --> 02:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
had over the years
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
this last year we have lost several
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
Wells and also furnaces for whatever the
 
02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:27.740 align:start position:0%
reason is on our furnaces and we are
 
02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
fixing those out of the fishing game
 
02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
fund and what we were what we're
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
originally trying to do was to seek
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
capital gains capital budget item to fix
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
that the governor suggested no
 
02:38:41.889 --> 02:38:41.899 align:start position:0%
these are basically at this point
 
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids until we finish the plan and
 
02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
decide exactly what you know where we're
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
going to raise fish and and to what
 
02:38:50.809 --> 02:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
volume of fish we're raising at our
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.939 --> 02:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the fish I apologize the septic
 
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
system is for humans it's at the Berlin
 
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
Hatchery at this time it is functioning
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
but we do know that it is showing some
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
signs of
 
02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.809 align:start position:0%
signs of
um

02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
um not functioning properly but it
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't it has not failed
 
02:39:21.479 --> 02:39:23.450 align:start position:0%
hasn't it has not failed
um

02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
some of these this facility is an old
 
02:39:29.809 --> 02:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
Federal facility uh uh I don't believe
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
we installed this we've had possession
 
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
of the facility since the 70s so we
 
02:39:37.490 --> 02:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
really don't know how old that septic
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
system is but we do know it's a fairly
 
02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.090 align:start position:0%
system is but we do know it's a fairly
old

02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:43.130 align:start position:0%
old
so

02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newton yeah thank you
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:39:49.319 --> 02:39:50.570 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds to me like uh Powder
 
02:39:55.969 --> 02:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
Mill is kind of taking a back seat
 
02:39:59.410 --> 02:39:59.420 align:start position:0%
to the urgency we were told last session
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
to do the upgrades to what is the EPA
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
putting the hammer down a little more
 
02:40:07.610 --> 02:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
because I know there's a problem with
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
the effluent going into the river which
 
02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
eventually goes into Winnipesaukee but
 
02:40:13.849 --> 02:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill is one of the biggest
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
hatcheries in the area and I'm
 
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
disappointed they've lost their salmon
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
fishery as a result of what's going on
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
there and I was led to believe that this
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
was going to all get better as they
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
improved the new powder Hatchery Mill
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
with new equipment that will be a lot
 
02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
cleaner well what we're looking at is
 
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
the cost to come into compliance at
 
02:40:37.370 --> 02:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill versus the cost of coming
 
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
into compliance in a different location
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
we may be looking at powder mill on a
 
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
much smaller scale than what it's
 
02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
currently being run at and that is as I
 
02:40:49.490 --> 02:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
say that is part of the long-term uh
 
02:40:51.889 --> 02:40:51.899 align:start position:0%
project that we are still in the process
 
02:40:54.190 --> 02:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
of researching and coming up with a plan
 
02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the salmon those one of the
 
02:40:59.270 --> 02:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
odd things we discovered was is that
 
02:41:01.490 --> 02:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
when we raised salmon in other locations
 
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
such as the federal hatchery in
 
02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
Nashville which is where we first raised
 
02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
them and then last year where we raised
 
02:41:09.889 --> 02:41:09.899 align:start position:0%
them at our new Hampton Hatchery the
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
water temperature was slightly warmer
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we had much better growth on our
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
salmon so we actually stocked a little
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
bigger salmon last year and the year
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
before coming out of those two
 
02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:20.330 align:start position:0%
before coming out of those two
hatcheries

02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
hatcheries
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman yes please yeah um
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
where are you currently raising salmon
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's not just the
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
federal uh New Hampton New Hampton thank
 
02:41:29.939 --> 02:41:34.730 align:start position:0%
federal uh New Hampton New Hampton thank
you

02:41:34.730 --> 02:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you um I have just a question
 
02:41:40.370 --> 02:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
so I I imagine fish and game has
 
02:41:43.010 --> 02:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
multiple locations throughout the state
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I would believe from your testimony
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
that sometimes funding can be hard to
 
02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
find and what gets replaced has fish and
 
02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
game looked into possibly partnering
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
with as far as the septic systems are
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
concerned uh partnering with uh New
 
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.630 align:start position:0%
concerned uh partnering with uh New
Hampshire

02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
site evaluators who are always looking
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
for locations to test and bring people
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
to and to evaluate facilities and
 
02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps you might be able to enlist them
 
02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
to on a Statewide level over the course
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
of a couple years to look into that for
 
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.610 align:start position:0%
of a couple years to look into that for
you

02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
no we have not
 
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
if if you wouldn't mind I might put them
 
02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
in touch with you yes at no cost and
 
02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
they need continuing education hours and
 
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
so forth and I think I think it could be
 
02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
of great benefit we'd offered that to
 
02:42:40.010 --> 02:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation they didn't
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
take that up in the past but I'll follow
 
02:42:45.370 --> 02:42:45.380 align:start position:0%
up with you on that sir we um
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
facilities management is certainly a big
 
02:42:51.530 --> 02:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
issue for our department and I think
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
that is an area that we can improve our
 
02:42:57.290 --> 02:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
Management program on and my thought is
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
it might give you a long long range you
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
know where you are at this point in time
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee we are our next hearing is for
 
02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions committee
 
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we could take at this point in
 
02:43:23.210 --> 02:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
time while we have a few minutes
 
02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
if not we will will recess till one
 
02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:28.910 align:start position:0%
if not we will will recess till one
o'clock

02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.920 --> 03:59:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.969 --> 03:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
time being 103 will pull Public Works

good afternoon everyone
 
04:00:26.170 --> 04:00:26.180 align:start position:0%
I have a three-page
 
04:00:28.010 --> 04:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
presentation that I'm going to walk
 
04:00:29.150 --> 04:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
through but then I have some other
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
handouts that I'll flag and there are
 
04:00:34.610 --> 04:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
some unusual aspects associated with
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
this particular Hearing in that I'm
 
04:00:38.689 --> 04:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
going to have conversation about capital
 
04:00:40.250 --> 04:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
projects that are not in your capital
 
04:00:40.260 --> 04:00:41.410 align:start position:0%
projects that are not in your capital
budget

04:00:41.410 --> 04:00:41.420 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:00:43.849 --> 04:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
and those are around some of the CTE
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
centers but I will start with the
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
purchase of 25 Hall Street which is the
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
current Granite State College building
 
04:00:56.210 --> 04:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
for uh to give you a little bit of brief
 
04:00:59.689 --> 04:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
history on Hall Street the Department of
 
04:01:02.330 --> 04:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
Education was formerly located in the
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
laundry again building in the state
 
04:01:06.769 --> 04:01:06.779 align:start position:0%
office complex
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
um about a year and a half ago we
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
started some work to renovate some
 
04:01:15.469 --> 04:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
asbestos in our building we knew we had
 
04:01:17.929 --> 04:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
asbestos in the flooring and
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
periodically if people were rolling
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
their chairs over that asbestos or
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
something else uh you know we had it
 
04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
sealed up it would crack and it would
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
need to get resealed and so we would do
 
04:01:27.239 --> 04:01:28.030 align:start position:0%
need to get resealed and so we would do
that

04:01:28.030 --> 04:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
we were able to find some funding to be
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
able to permanently fix that by
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
replacing the floor so we didn't have
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
that exposure in the process of
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
remediating that asbestos the vendors
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
were in our office and they were
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
discussing the remediation of the
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
asbestos in the floor and they indicated
 
04:01:49.490 --> 04:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
well what are you going to do about the
 
04:01:52.370 --> 04:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
asbestos in the ceiling and so that was
 
04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
information that we previously didn't
 
04:01:57.650 --> 04:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
have and I can tell you that even
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
in my own tenure at the department we
 
04:02:03.650 --> 04:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
had pulled cables in those ceilings we
 
04:02:05.330 --> 04:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
had installed new
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
um you know Fire Systems in there so a
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff was happening there as a
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
result of that we realized that the
 
04:02:13.319 --> 04:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
result of that we realized that the
building

04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
may not be appropriate for occupation at
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
that time and so we essentially
 
04:02:23.450 --> 04:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
abandoned the building and we found we
 
04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
located ourselves in other parts of the
 
04:02:30.650 --> 04:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
state complex and worked remotely and so
 
04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
what that meant was we doubled up and we
 
04:02:34.130 --> 04:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
had some people who are working the
 
04:02:36.410 --> 04:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Thursday in the office and
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
working remotely other days other people
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
who are working Mondays Wednesdays and
 
04:02:41.210 --> 04:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
Fridays and they would come into the
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
office Tuesday Thursday so we basically
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
double upped our space we found some
 
04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
space over at Health and Human Services
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
and we squeezed in in Johnson Hall but
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
really we kind of it was we dispersed
 
04:02:53.330 --> 04:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
the organization we had one division
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
that was working fully remotely at that
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
um simultaneous to this and I think
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
somewhat fortuitously the university
 
04:03:05.150 --> 04:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
system uh merged Granite State College
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
into UNH resulting in many of the
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
employees at the Granite State College
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
building into the UNH Manchester campus
 
04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
and so they were leaving that building
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that building was available
 
04:03:20.410 --> 04:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
so last January
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
we moved into that building so we had we
 
04:03:23.340 --> 04:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
we moved into that building so we had we
basically

04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:03:27.650 --> 04:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
um left Lonergan Hall about August of
 
04:03:27.660 --> 04:03:29.929 align:start position:0%
um left Lonergan Hall about August of
22.

04:03:29.929 --> 04:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
22.
 
04:03:32.750 --> 04:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
21 August of 21
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
um and then we moved into Granite State
 
04:03:39.170 --> 04:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.210 --> 04:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
22 yes got to get all my dates correct
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
you need to lose track
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so we have been there we
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
have had active and ongoing
 
04:03:50.809 --> 04:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
conversations with the university system
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
they don't need the facility at 25 Hall
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
Street and so we because of that we're
 
04:04:00.729 --> 04:04:00.739 align:start position:0%
leasing it from them right now
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
we made the proposal to procure that
 
04:04:03.720 --> 04:04:04.570 align:start position:0%
we made the proposal to procure that
building

04:04:04.570 --> 04:04:04.580 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
as a facility it is
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um more user friendly to the work that
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
we do for a couple of reasons one is and
 
04:04:16.610 --> 04:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
this is a little known fact is we have a
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
number of unique visitors so we have
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
about 7 000 unique visitors unique
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
visitors per year uh to the Department
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
of Education these are in you know
 
04:04:28.490 --> 04:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
mostly Educators coming in for licensure
 
04:04:31.370 --> 04:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
issues or other types of training issues
 
04:04:33.410 --> 04:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
that they have we also conduct a high
 
04:04:36.050 --> 04:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
number of trainings in our facility at
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the Granite State College building there
 
04:04:39.769 --> 04:04:39.779 align:start position:0%
are several classroom facilities that
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
enable our ability to host those at the
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
facility rather than to locate outside
 
04:04:48.410 --> 04:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
facilities for the various trainings and
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do and so it is a a
 
04:04:54.769 --> 04:04:54.779 align:start position:0%
facility that is conducive to the work
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we do at the department so we
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
initially submitted a capital budget
 
04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
request for seven million dollars which
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
at the time was the estimate that Kathy
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
provencher and myself we worked with
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
their capital team at the UNH and
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
determined that seven million dollars
 
04:05:14.090 --> 04:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
would be a good place holder in terms of
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what the value
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
would be that is what we submitted in
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
our agency budget that was increased in
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
the budgeting process through a Das
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
process increasing that to 10.5 million
 
04:05:29.809 --> 04:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
dollars as the capital item and so that
 
04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
is where we stand right now we are
 
04:05:32.929 --> 04:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
leasing that facility from the
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
University system
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
without that facility we don't have we
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
presently don't have a home the Lonergan
 
04:05:41.050 --> 04:05:41.060 align:start position:0%
hall building
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
is currently being worked on by the
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services to
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
be refurbished and there's an estimate
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
probably around and my guess is around
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
two years to be able to fully refurbish
 
04:05:59.090 --> 04:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
that facility one of the advantages in a
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
conversation I've had with Charlie
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus relative to this is you know
 
04:06:05.150 --> 04:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
if that facility is refurbished and
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
becomes occupiable again then
 
04:06:10.929 --> 04:06:10.939 align:start position:0%
it's likely that there are other
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
agencies that would need would probably
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
move in there likely from HHS they would
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
occupy that facility and we would remain
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
where we are but again it really depends
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
on what the legislature wants to do
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
relative to this particular building if
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
they want to acquire this building or
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
not if we don't acquire this building we
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't have another place that we would
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
go as an agency and we would obviously
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
then have to seek some type of lease
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
space or some other type of space for
 
04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
so that is the first project and I will
 
04:06:43.969 --> 04:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
take questions on that and then I'm
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to introduce two other projects to
 
04:06:45.600 --> 04:06:46.550 align:start position:0%
going to introduce two other projects to
you

04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Adler the
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
so I I guess maybe
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
so we had appropriated monies when you
 
04:06:59.570 --> 04:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
were in the last capital budget because
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
your the state of your bathrooms over in
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
that building
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
um were those are those Renovations and
 
04:07:08.210 --> 04:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
I think we've had some conversations
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
since that those Renovations where they
 
04:07:14.050 --> 04:07:14.060 align:start position:0%
put in place or is that money on hold
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
they were not put in place at this point
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
in time
 
04:07:20.330 --> 04:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
that is part of the overall project that
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
Das will be working on in renovating the
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
entire building it includes those
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and the funds for those
 
04:07:28.849 --> 04:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
bathrooms so is is that money showing up
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
as as a lapse
 
04:07:33.769 --> 04:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
an extension yes we've requested an
 
04:07:37.250 --> 04:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
extension yes but but the problem is now
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're in the wrong agency
 
04:07:41.570 --> 04:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
if Das is doing the work
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
the funds you're appropriated are in the
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
wrong agency
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
um Das has always done the work so even
 
04:07:50.809 --> 04:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
though they were in our agency Das was
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
doing the work and we were just going to
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
encumber those funds so basically Das
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
would give us the information we would
 
04:08:00.769 --> 04:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
all right let's representative
 
04:08:03.660 --> 04:08:04.490 align:start position:0%
all right let's representative
um

04:08:04.490 --> 04:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
so my question I'll come back to my
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
did I hear commissioner when you were
 
04:08:13.729 --> 04:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
speaking and you were getting through
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
those projects and you had the broken
 
04:08:18.530 --> 04:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
tiles and Asbestos and issues and so
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
forth did I hear you say then when
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
you've got someone said what are you
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
doing about the uh
 
04:08:27.530 --> 04:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
the ceilings and we've done extensive
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
work over there over the years I would
 
04:08:31.729 --> 04:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
imagine and that's just now coming to
 
04:08:31.739 --> 04:08:33.290 align:start position:0%
imagine and that's just now coming to
light

04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
light
 
04:08:34.849 --> 04:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
should I speak to Public Works about
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
that so that would be a question for
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
public works I think that there was a
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
2000 and when did they have that study
 
04:08:43.929 --> 04:08:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's about like 2007 2009 there
 
04:08:48.889 --> 04:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
was a study um unfortunately none of
 
04:08:48.899 --> 04:08:49.670 align:start position:0%
was a study um unfortunately none of
those

04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know areas of asbestos have been
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
marked as such okay in your new building
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
the um the Hall Street Building and I
 
04:09:00.050 --> 04:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate the multiple times we've
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
tried to arrange going over there which
 
04:09:03.530 --> 04:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
we will
 
04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so is is there even more Office Space
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
over there that's available than you're
 
04:09:13.309 --> 04:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
moving into or or your needs going to
 
04:09:15.769 --> 04:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
fill that entire building so it would be
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
depend on what the committee wants to do
 
04:09:20.210 --> 04:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
but we fill most of the building right
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
now there's a small section that is
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
continuing to be occupied by Granite
 
04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
State College and on the in the basement
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
floor there's a small section that is
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
occupied by third party lessees at this
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
point in time okay but otherwise we've
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
moved into the you know the totality of
 
04:09:37.969 --> 04:09:37.979 align:start position:0%
the building if we were to further
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate you know if those two spaces
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
became available to us we would try to
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
initially move our career in technical
 
04:09:45.769 --> 04:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
education which is in the Walker
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
building over as well as our adult
 
04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
education programming
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
and then at that point you would be
 
04:09:54.050 --> 04:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
fully occupied correct okay thank you
 
04:09:55.849 --> 04:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner on this
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
before we move on
 
04:10:01.090 --> 04:10:01.100 align:start position:0%
yes please representative
 
04:10:03.889 --> 04:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you um how old is this building
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.969 --> 04:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to it I do know
 
04:10:15.410 --> 04:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
that it was complete it was fully
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
refurbished by the university system
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.580 --> 04:10:21.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:10:24.050 --> 04:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
about many government buildings when
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
they hit
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
50 years or 40 years they're obsolete so
 
04:10:32.090 --> 04:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
I would hate to get into something like
 
04:10:32.100 --> 04:10:33.729 align:start position:0%
I would hate to get into something like
that

04:10:33.729 --> 04:10:33.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
something like you know purchasing
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
something like that if that's gonna
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
something we'll have to deal with in the
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
future yes so I can tell you that you
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
know in our current occupancy of the
 
04:10:46.370 --> 04:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
building it has been fully refurbished
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
already so um like in other words like
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
when we moved in there it was literally
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
a move-in condition when the university
 
04:10:53.689 --> 04:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
system left they left their Furniture I
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
mean it was totally as is we just moved
 
04:10:59.090 --> 04:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
ourselves in including furnished
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative

ahead but we can get the date of the the
 
04:11:08.689 --> 04:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
purchase or the date of the construction
 
04:11:10.130 --> 04:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
of that building
 
04:11:10.140 --> 04:11:12.050 align:start position:0%
of that building
19.

04:11:12.050 --> 04:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
19.
 
04:11:12.060 --> 04:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
19.
1987.

04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
1987.
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
are you all set represented
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to ask one okay please
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead one follow-up
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that building is asbestos
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
free then as far as We Know
 
04:11:26.880 --> 04:11:28.070 align:start position:0%
free then as far as We Know
okay

04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm sure that's going to be
 
04:11:33.130 --> 04:11:33.140 align:start position:0%
assessed so we have that answer yes
 
04:11:35.150 --> 04:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you that was going to be my
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
question Shannon okay thank you further
 
04:11:37.920 --> 04:11:39.530 align:start position:0%
question Shannon okay thank you further
questions

04:11:39.530 --> 04:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
I will say we've had a
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
I I'll come right back to you uh we have
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
had a conversation on that 10.5 million
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
and there's another number floating out
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
there the seven yes yes so seven is what
 
04:11:55.250 --> 04:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
we had initially estimated and that was
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
a number that was derived with uh Kathy
 
04:11:59.450 --> 04:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
provenchar who is the vice Chancellor
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
over at the University system and their
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
Capital folks and myself
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and then subsequently when we
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
submitted that the department of
 
04:12:09.889 --> 04:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
administrative Services increased that
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
number from 7 to 10.5 thank you sir
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
um yes representative vallone
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:12:20.689 --> 04:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question what
 
04:12:24.050 --> 04:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
is the square footage of Lonergan
 
04:12:24.060 --> 04:12:25.370 align:start position:0%
is the square footage of Lonergan
people

04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:12:28.729 --> 04:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
approximately fifty thousand so so you
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner elbow
 
04:12:36.530 --> 04:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
yes please representative uh thank you
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thanks for the answer to
 
04:12:38.520 --> 04:12:39.650 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thanks for the answer to
this

04:12:39.650 --> 04:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I assume that you've done somebody's
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
done a complete inspection of the
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
building everything HVAC and everything
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing else that has to be
 
04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
fixed or is this the 10.5 include any
 
04:12:53.330 --> 04:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
upgrades or something you might have to
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
do so that it has not yet been inspected
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so we assume that and through the
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
procurement process and Department of
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is here to
 
04:13:05.090 --> 04:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
address any questions through the
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
procurement process the initial step is
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
really to be able to get approval to
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
move forward and then we will do that
 
04:13:14.450 --> 04:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
can I have a funnel okay thank you
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
when is this assessment going to be
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
completed is it going to be completed in
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
time for us during our review of the
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
04:13:22.969 --> 04:13:22.979 align:start position:0%
elect Department of administrative
 
04:13:26.210 --> 04:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Karen rantamaki
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
with Department of administrative
 
04:13:35.450 --> 04:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
services for the record
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
um so we're as part of the purchase
 
04:13:39.650 --> 04:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
process we would undergo you know what I
 
04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
like to call a home Home Inspection just
 
04:13:43.969 --> 04:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
um to use a term that that people are
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
um we're currently doing one over at uh
 
04:13:51.290 --> 04:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
Granite place prior to you know
 
04:13:52.969 --> 04:13:52.979 align:start position:0%
purchasing that building if that was to
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
get approved so we will initiate the
 
04:13:57.170 --> 04:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
same process here and it will take about
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
a month so
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
um we can move forward with that you
 
04:14:03.050 --> 04:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
know as soon as as soon as it makes
 
04:14:07.729 --> 04:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
sense to okay thank you further question
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none do you want to move on on
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
your presentation I'd be happy to do
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
that so then I would also like to flag
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the committee to CTE centers that we
 
04:14:22.189 --> 04:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
have initially submitted in our Capital
 
04:14:22.199 --> 04:14:24.070 align:start position:0%
have initially submitted in our Capital
request

04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
these were both submitted as the agency
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
through the capital process in the
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget
 
04:14:30.779 --> 04:14:32.269 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget
the

04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
capital projects associated with the CTE
 
04:14:37.849 --> 04:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
Center rebuilds were moved out of the
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
capital budget into the education trust
 
04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
fund and one of those CTE centers was
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
dropped out of that funding proposal I
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's you know we can we
 
04:14:51.010 --> 04:14:51.020 align:start position:0%
can do this if you want if you have time
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
Jeff is here to kind of address some of
 
04:14:55.969 --> 04:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
the highlights associated with our CTE
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
centers I'm not sure how familiar
 
04:15:00.769 --> 04:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
members of this committee are with what
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
our CTE education is and what it does
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
for the state and for the students of
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that valuable for you I
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
if if we could contain that into a USA
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
Edition article I'd really I'd really
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it'd be helpful for the
 
04:15:14.220 --> 04:15:15.670 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it'd be helpful for the
members

04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
gladly thank you
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so if I could direct everyone to page
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
five of the the handout that was
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
provided that the cover of it is uh has
 
04:15:27.849 --> 04:15:27.859 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of career development logo
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
the uh one very important thing about
 
04:15:32.090 --> 04:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
Career Technical Ed is that it's a
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
really powerful economic driver for the
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire if you think that
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
each uh CTE program has the potential to
 
04:15:40.490 --> 04:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
graduate between 10 and 20 students per
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
year and there are as you can see here
 
04:15:47.150 --> 04:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
some projected growth of about 10 000
 
04:15:50.450 --> 04:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
jobs across the state that's one year's
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
growth and that's a fairly consistent
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
Trend that we've been seeing since the
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
recovery from uh from covid that means
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
that each region has the potential to
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
provide a powerful pipeline of trained
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable employees for
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
Employers in their area
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
the the other piece of that is the time
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
to actually enter the workforce is uh is
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
relatively quick there are some of our
 
04:16:15.530 --> 04:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
programs that are more trades focused
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
for example a young person after two
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
years of entering a CTE program is ready
 
04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
to enter the workforce when there's a
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
little bit more Education and Training
 
04:16:25.370 --> 04:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
needed it's between two and four years
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
to enter the workforce so it's a fairly
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
quick turnaround time to respond to the
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
needs of employers
 
04:16:31.849 --> 04:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
um piece and then the next two slides
 
04:16:36.290 --> 04:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
are a little bit of testimony given by
 
04:16:39.170 --> 04:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state but I did want to
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
direct everyone to page
 
04:16:44.929 --> 04:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
nine of the handout and just give a
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
little historical context of the CTE
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
projects in the past
 
04:16:52.610 --> 04:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
so as you can see the the current two
 
04:16:55.210 --> 04:16:55.220 align:start position:0%
projects are highlighted on that table
 
04:16:58.370 --> 04:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
the budgets for each is fairly in line
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
with what has been funded previously you
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
can see uh over the time captured on
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
this table that construction costs have
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
increased but overall these projects are
 
04:17:12.650 --> 04:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
are in line with what has been funded in
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
previous uh budgets
 
04:17:18.830 --> 04:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
the the two projects that are utter
 
04:17:22.010 --> 04:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
consideration are Newport and win a
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
squab let's go for one second and just
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
see if the question is generally about I
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
just you know that's kind of a highlight
 
04:17:31.010 --> 04:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
of CTE uh the program serves about 9500
 
04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
students across the state both in
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
ascending and receiving districts again
 
04:17:38.090 --> 04:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
students enter into those programs as
 
04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
early as 10th grade they generally spend
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
two years students that come out of
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
there earn an industry recognize
 
04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
credential for their participation in
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
that program so these are students who
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
are already credentialed exiting high
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
school at that point in time in their
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so then let me let me just
 
04:17:59.570 --> 04:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
flag for you the two projects if I may
 
04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
so the two projects that we have before
 
04:18:06.050 --> 04:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
you are the uh Sugar River RTC Center in
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
Newport this is a renovation for 12
 
04:18:13.849 --> 04:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
million 500 000 approximately
 
04:18:13.859 --> 04:18:14.510 align:start position:0%
million 500 000 approximately
um

04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:17.809 --> 04:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
and uh is a project that and and one of
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
the things that that Jeff was pointing
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
out is that these projects have been in
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
the queue for a number of years for
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
decades actually
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and we generally fund about two of
 
04:18:27.309 --> 04:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
them each year
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that particular project has a
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
community a vote already approving and
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
authorizing the local match associated
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
with it so they are literally shovel
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
ready uh the architect is here today and
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
he can tell you that when this project
 
04:18:44.450 --> 04:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
is approved we are ready to begin
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
construction on July 1. uh there are the
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
bid process has already begun we've got
 
04:18:51.370 --> 04:18:51.380 align:start position:0%
contractors bidding on this work now
 
04:18:54.170 --> 04:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
the second project is a project in
 
04:18:56.929 --> 04:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
winnisquam this is a project that has
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
been on the books for some amount of
 
04:19:02.689 --> 04:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
times it's uh 7.6 million dollars and
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
again they have been waiting and working
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
in their Community to try and get uh you
 
04:19:07.729 --> 04:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
know the approval for this project
 
04:19:09.790 --> 04:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
they've done all the architecture
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
they are anticipating going to their
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
voters this month to get approval I will
 
04:19:17.450 --> 04:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
point out that they went to their voters
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
previously and they were within 10 votes
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
of getting approval so there is some
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
degree of confidence that this will be
 
04:19:25.330 --> 04:19:25.340 align:start position:0%
more successful
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting approval because it
 
04:19:30.530 --> 04:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
was not already approved by the the
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
voters in the community it was not able
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
it was not included in the governor's uh
 
04:19:38.929 --> 04:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
you know funding for the CTE Center
 
04:19:38.939 --> 04:19:40.729 align:start position:0%
you know funding for the CTE Center
Renovations

04:19:40.729 --> 04:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
Renovations
 
04:19:40.739 --> 04:19:41.570 align:start position:0%
Renovations
um

04:19:41.570 --> 04:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
in and even if we you know we take that
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
into consideration so we'll go to voting
 
04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
later this month I believe it's on uh
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
March 25th if it doesn't uh get approval
 
04:19:53.689 --> 04:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
then it won't go forward obviously but
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
we are encouraging uh you know the
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
ability to try and do this project it is
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
an important project in the community
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's an important project for our
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
education system in terms of making sure
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
that students in that particular region
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
have the ability to partake in some of
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
these Career and Technical education
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
advancements in both cases
 
04:20:16.010 --> 04:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you know the the conversation and in
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget he took it out of
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
the capital budget which I guess is a
 
04:20:21.050 --> 04:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
good for you found money and capital
 
04:20:23.210 --> 04:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
committee right and has been moved over
 
04:20:23.220 --> 04:20:24.590 align:start position:0%
committee right and has been moved over
to

04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
um the education trust fund so I only
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention because
 
04:20:31.610 --> 04:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
while the governor has funded 12.5
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the Sugar Valley in
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund it is possible
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
if this committee decides that they want
 
04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
to do that to be able to fund uh the win
 
04:20:42.290 --> 04:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
a Squam project in the capital budget if
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's if you see fit to do that
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
and we and I will point out that we have
 
04:20:48.889 --> 04:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
representatives from both of the schools
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
here if there are specific questions
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have for those
 
04:20:54.410 --> 04:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
communities who are working on those
 
04:20:57.410 --> 04:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
projects including the architect for
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
both projects
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
I will um just say that over my 20-year
 
04:21:06.849 --> 04:21:06.859 align:start position:0%
that I've been around this committee
 
04:21:09.769 --> 04:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
it's always been a high very high
 
04:21:13.010 --> 04:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
priority for this committee to make sure
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
that we do everything we can to get to
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
schools into the cycle we've fallen
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
short at times we've had Governors tell
 
04:21:22.849 --> 04:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
us we couldn't fund any but we have
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
always made sure that we at least were
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
able to upgrade one the issue is if you
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
only upgrade one then it's a cycle
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
backwards and instead of getting our
 
04:21:35.929 --> 04:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
schools brought up to standard every 20
 
04:21:38.210 --> 04:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
years it just it just delays the process
 
04:21:40.849 --> 04:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
and needless to say the cost is more are
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
there questions yes representative yes
 
04:21:46.130 --> 04:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh just to piggyback on what he said in
 
04:21:48.769 --> 04:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
the past we have for instance your your
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
seven and a half million dollars for
 
04:21:52.849 --> 04:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
when a Squam but it hasn't been voted on
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
yet in the past we've always asked that
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
if we devote this money and you don't
 
04:22:00.170 --> 04:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
and they can't come through with the
 
04:22:01.729 --> 04:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
matching thing rather than just let the
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
money go to waste do you have somebody
 
04:22:06.769 --> 04:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
in queue that can step in and take that
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
money if we appropriate it yes uh uh
 
04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
conval Region 14 is uh needs to do their
 
04:22:15.889 --> 04:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
preliminary planning but they are ready
 
04:22:18.050 --> 04:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
and they have a uh they're prepared to
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
have a vote uh in hand so they would be
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
they would be next in line and would be
 
04:22:22.140 --> 04:22:25.269 align:start position:0%
they would be next in line and would be
prepared

04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
we have some idea what what their need
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
would be in millions
 
04:22:33.530 --> 04:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
that I don't know uh off the top I had
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
to be honest that's all right if you can
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
get back to us on that if um is so this
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
seven can you just address I know we
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an awful lot of time do you
 
04:22:45.110 --> 04:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
do you have details here on win a Squam
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
and kind of tell us can someone tell us
 
04:22:49.010 --> 04:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
what the scope of what it is you're
 
04:22:51.170 --> 04:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
trying to do or a new program
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
enhancement at winners Squam Newport is
 
04:22:56.809 --> 04:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
already in there and I don't suspect
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of conversation about that
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
or we can get back to you on that sure
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
and there is a presentation that we
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
handed out to you on the when a Squam
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
project so that you'll have all of the
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
details about the program
 
04:23:11.389 --> 04:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy if somebody from the
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
community wants to come up and share
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
with you what their objectives are would
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
that be appropriate that would be
 
04:23:26.150 --> 04:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:26.160 --> 04:23:28.610 align:start position:0%
 
ly

04:23:28.610 --> 04:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Shannon Bartlett I'm the
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the one of Squam
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
Regional School District
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm new this year to win a Squam so I I
 
04:23:40.370 --> 04:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
came in after the first vote for this
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
project but we've worked extensively
 
04:23:44.809 --> 04:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
this year to gather more support from
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
our community members what we plan to do
 
04:23:49.250 --> 04:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
is double the footprint of the building
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can renovate the spaces that
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
currently exist for our two AG programs
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
our natural resources and plant and
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
animal science and then the increased
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
space would be for adding the
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program and a Precision
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so you you would add two new
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
programs and those one was cosmetology
 
04:24:14.090 --> 04:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
and what was the other one Precision
 
04:24:18.050 --> 04:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
manufacturing which means what it is if
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
you think about end
 
04:24:22.370 --> 04:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
and as as one
 
04:24:23.689 --> 04:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
engineering background Precision
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is the actual
 
04:24:26.160 --> 04:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is the actual
um

04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
cutting of machine shops yeah so what
 
04:24:31.849 --> 04:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
they basically yeah they're teaching
 
04:24:33.769 --> 04:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
students how to machine they'll use CNC
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
machines and teach them how to cut parts
 
04:24:38.689 --> 04:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
for you know Precision Machining thank
 
04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
you thank you so are you in in if this
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
was able to move forward are you
 
04:24:46.849 --> 04:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
partnering with anyone on this the
 
04:24:49.130 --> 04:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
cosmetology do you have
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
Paul yeah you know can you tell me about
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
that that's we're working with Empire
 
04:24:55.729 --> 04:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
Beauty School which is local in Laconia
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
on the cosmetology end and several local
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
businesses are supportive of this and
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
then for precision manufacturing eptam
 
04:25:09.050 --> 04:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
3M freudenberg STS Aerospace we have
 
04:25:10.450 --> 04:25:10.460 align:start position:0%
several different
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
businesses locally that are partnering
 
04:25:15.889 --> 04:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
with us and we'll if I could will any of
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
those bring lab labs in for you to train
 
04:25:22.729 --> 04:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
your train your students so that when
 
04:25:25.010 --> 04:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
they come out like I believe you have
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
over there your your air conditioning
 
04:25:30.769 --> 04:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
program and others and some of the
 
04:25:34.849 --> 04:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
schools have Auto Labs is anybody coming
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
in to help you provide part of your lab
 
04:25:38.159 --> 04:25:39.290 align:start position:0%
in to help you provide part of your lab
work

04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:25:41.450 --> 04:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
well we're hoping to have work with
 
04:25:43.330 --> 04:25:43.340 align:start position:0%
these companies for equipment donations
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
but then we will staff our programs with
 
04:25:50.090 --> 04:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
you know experts in the fields people
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
fields and and if I may um work based
 
04:25:56.570 --> 04:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
learning is a requirement of every CTE
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
program in the state of New Hampshire so
 
04:25:59.929 --> 04:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
there's a component where whether it's
 
04:26:01.729 --> 04:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
students going out to do internships in
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the community with employers or
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
employers coming in it's part of our
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
federal accountability reporting we
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
receive about six million dollars in
 
04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
federal funding each year for Career
 
04:26:13.490 --> 04:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
Technical education programs it's one of
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
our accountability metrics but it's also
 
04:26:18.170 --> 04:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
a requirement in order to be an approved
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
CT program in New Hampshire and to
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
maintain that approval for the program
 
04:26:24.110 --> 04:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
you must have a work-based learning
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
component which is exactly what uh was
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
just described and as well each of these
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
programs has a industry Advisory Group
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
which is made up of the industries in
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
that sector and in that area that works
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
very closely with the students with the
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
schools to make sure that you know if
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're training them on using a certain
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
CNC machine it's the stuff that our
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
Industries need it's not just what we
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
decide that they want and you're animal
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
and plant science program and natural
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
res are those well students wanting to
 
04:26:56.210 --> 04:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
go in there Yes actually our enrollment
 
04:26:58.370 --> 04:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
has just climbed over the last five or
 
04:27:00.769 --> 04:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
six years so and I think there's a chart
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
in there that shows that enrollment
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
right I mean this is also one of the
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
areas that we see as a growth industry
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
in the state is around the plant science
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
in particular where you have these large
 
04:27:10.849 --> 04:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse operations that are coming
 
04:27:12.649 --> 04:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
into the state and you need individuals
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
who are well versed in the science
 
04:27:17.929 --> 04:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
associated with that type of an
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
agricultural industry and and obviously
 
04:27:22.969 --> 04:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
very unique to the cold climate like a
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:27:25.080 --> 04:27:27.469 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
questions

04:27:27.469 --> 04:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:27:29.570 --> 04:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack thank you Mr
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and I thank you for taking my
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
question do I understand that the the AG
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
Center is part of the CTE or it's a
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
separate separate uh
 
04:27:37.800 --> 04:27:39.170 align:start position:0%
separate separate uh
effort

04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
it is part of our our building right now
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
is is just for agriculture so we would
 
04:27:46.729 --> 04:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
be adding to it and becoming a regional
 
04:27:49.370 --> 04:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
CTE Center
 
04:27:50.689 --> 04:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
another question
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.969 --> 04:27:57.979 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:28:00.649 --> 04:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with the the first
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
CET that was mentioned so I don't know
 
04:28:04.689 --> 04:28:04.699 align:start position:0%
if I want to hold it or if I want
 
04:28:04.699 --> 04:28:06.590 align:start position:0%
if I want to hold it or if I want
okay

04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:09.889 --> 04:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
um the basically 12 and a half million
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's gonna I guess go before the
 
04:28:13.729 --> 04:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
um and it's going to come out of
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
Education trust funds so they you just
 
04:28:18.530 --> 04:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
paint it out right from there or you're
 
04:28:20.689 --> 04:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
going to be bonding it from there or
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
no that would come that would be a
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
direct funding through the education
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
but not bonded oh direct payment okay
 
04:28:31.010 --> 04:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
correct very good thank you thank you
 
04:28:31.020 --> 04:28:33.170 align:start position:0%
correct very good thank you thank you
okay

04:28:33.170 --> 04:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right I I believe you've answered my
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
the local businesses that are supporting
 
04:28:45.889 --> 04:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
this operation from what I'm looking at
 
04:28:47.929 --> 04:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
the list they seem to all be within
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
Belknap County so that would help
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the Machining processes and stuff
 
04:28:57.649 --> 04:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
like that that's a big
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
business within Belknap County itself as
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
far as adding uh a labor force that is
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
lacking at the moment because if one
 
04:29:12.110 --> 04:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
would look in the newspaper it seems
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's always
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
a large amount of requests for help in
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Machining aspect of that business is
 
04:29:23.450 --> 04:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
that true that is true we actually did
 
04:29:25.250 --> 04:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
at one of our events was a panel
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
discussion where we brought in people
 
04:29:29.210 --> 04:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
from business Managers from these
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
businesses and they talked about their
 
04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
desperate need for employees and how
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
much they would welcome these programs
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and offer internships and experiences to
 
04:29:41.330 --> 04:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
get students in the door so they were
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
really excited about it and another
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
aspect is for every program that's
 
04:29:47.090 --> 04:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
approved we go through kind of using
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
jobs EQ data to make sure that there are
 
04:29:53.450 --> 04:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
a sufficient number of job opportunities
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
at an appropriate wage for individuals
 
04:29:57.889 --> 04:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
in these communities to be able to
 
04:29:57.899 --> 04:30:01.670 align:start position:0%
in these communities to be able to
succeed

04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
if and it's an if if
 
04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
the committee were to come up and make
 
04:30:09.889 --> 04:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
policy decision that they wanted to move
 
04:30:12.130 --> 04:30:12.140 align:start position:0%
forward with the two schools
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
in this 7.6 million dollars
 
04:30:19.610 --> 04:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
is are you confident this money could be
 
04:30:25.250 --> 04:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
spent in in this time to have this
 
04:30:27.410 --> 04:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
happen or is this a project if we could
 
04:30:31.729 --> 04:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
find you four million to start in
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
so let me just clarify the question
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we've done this in the past
 
04:30:37.809 --> 04:30:37.819 align:start position:0%
we've split CTE centers over a biennium
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I know the answer to
 
04:30:40.620 --> 04:30:43.849 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I know the answer to
that

04:30:43.849 --> 04:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it probably has to happen nobody
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
anymore and part I mean in in Lance is
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
here and we can have him describe that
 
04:30:50.809 --> 04:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
in particular but one of the issues
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
might be uh costs associated with
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
building as you know there's been
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
leading up to this point in time there's
 
04:30:57.769 --> 04:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
been a significant amount of inflation
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
in the project so if you as we delay the
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
costs generally are going up at this
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
point in time so it may not be a good
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
candidate for a split thank you
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I think we're fine here do you have
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
something else to present at this time
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
no that would be everything thank you
 
04:31:17.570 --> 04:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:31:19.490 --> 04:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate your time and thank
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
you great if the committee has any other
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions we're happy to come back thank
 
04:31:22.560 --> 04:33:35.410 align:start position:0%
questions we're happy to come back thank
you

04:33:35.410 --> 04:33:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:38.330 --> 04:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy uh why
 
04:33:40.010 --> 04:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
don't you come on forward while we're
 
04:33:42.131 --> 04:33:42.141 align:start position:0%
passing out some information
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.929 --> 04:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
Department of energy welcome to Public
 
04:34:35.939 --> 04:34:37.131 align:start position:0%
Department of energy welcome to Public
Works

04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
Works
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
some faces I recognize you just please
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves and tell us what
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're asking for in the capital budget
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris Elms I'm the
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm joined by
 
04:34:54.650 --> 04:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott who is the director of our
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
division of policy and programs
 
04:34:59.330 --> 04:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
among the varied responsibilities of the
 
04:35:01.490 --> 04:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
Department of energy are a number of
 
04:35:03.289 --> 04:35:03.299 align:start position:0%
assistance programs that we administer
 
04:35:06.010 --> 04:35:06.020 align:start position:0%
this includes the federally funded
 
04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
low-income home energy assistance
 
04:35:11.449 --> 04:35:11.459 align:start position:0%
program LIHEAP which funds what we call
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
the fuel assistance program that program
 
04:35:17.449 --> 04:35:17.459 align:start position:0%
provides fuel assistance to eligible
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
households who are 60 percent or under
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
State median income we also administer
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
the federal weatherization assistance
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
program which similarly provides
 
04:35:30.170 --> 04:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
weatherization services to households
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
that are 60 percent of State median
 
04:35:34.330 --> 04:35:34.340 align:start position:0%
income or below
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
both of these programs are administered
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
by the department and we contract out
 
04:35:41.810 --> 04:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
with the local Community Action agencies
 
04:35:44.570 --> 04:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
for the on the ground work
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
um you know working with applicants
 
04:35:48.289 --> 04:35:48.299 align:start position:0%
processing those applications and
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
getting payment out behind all of that
 
04:35:53.631 --> 04:35:53.641 align:start position:0%
is a software system that tracks and
 
04:35:53.641 --> 04:35:54.709 align:start position:0%
is a software system that tracks and
manages

04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
manages
 
04:35:57.490 --> 04:35:57.500 align:start position:0%
basically the whole assistance process
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
from eligibility determinations to
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
benefit determinations all the way
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
through payment and then the federal
 
04:36:07.250 --> 04:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
compliance reporting
 
04:36:09.529 --> 04:36:09.539 align:start position:0%
um the software has passed its useful
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
life and this federally funded capital
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
budget proposal will provide better
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
service to the people of New Hampshire
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
if it is approved and able to move
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
forward I'm going to turn it over to
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
Josh who's going to talk a little bit
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
about the specific problems we're
 
04:36:24.051 --> 04:36:24.061 align:start position:0%
dealing with and and the potential
 
04:36:26.689 --> 04:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
solution thank you
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:36:29.810 --> 04:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
the committee as the Deputy Commissioner
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned I am Josh Elliott director of
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
the division of policy and programs
 
04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
um again the two programs we're talking
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
about today the weatherization
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
assistance program as well as the fuel
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
assistance program fall within uh this
 
04:36:40.859 --> 04:36:41.810 align:start position:0%
assistance program fall within uh this
division

04:36:41.810 --> 04:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:36:43.730 --> 04:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
so there's three real main reasons that
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
we're asking for this capital budget
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
request first is the Deputy Commissioner
 
04:36:49.970 --> 04:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
alluded to the current software is
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 years old is obsolete in his
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
risk of failing it's a very fragile
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
system as currently exists and also it
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
can't uh it can no longer keep up with
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
the increased federal reporting
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
requirements weatherization assistance
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
program the fuel assistance program are
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
both 100 federally funded as is this
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
request it is 100 federal funds lastly
 
04:37:14.689 --> 04:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
it'll increase efficiencies both of the
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies as well as the
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
department of energy itself in terms of
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
managing these programs which will
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
result in Greater service to the people
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire so as the
 
04:37:28.250 --> 04:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner mentioned did some
 
04:37:29.570 --> 04:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
discussion about what exactly the
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
software is and what it does it really
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
is the backbone of this system it takes
 
04:37:35.570 --> 04:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
manages everything from the intake
 
04:37:37.730 --> 04:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
process all the way through to the
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
federal reporting on the opposite end in
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
every single step in between
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
so to give you a sense of scale the fuel
 
04:37:46.970 --> 04:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
assistance program has roughly 24 000
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
clients or households that it serves
 
04:37:51.170 --> 04:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
every year WAP is smaller usually serves
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
between 300 and 400 households per year
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
the system itself actually intakes more
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
than that so if you think there's folks
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
who apply who are then denied assistance
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
usually it's over income so the total
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
number is usually closer to 30 000 every
 
04:38:04.740 --> 04:38:06.289 align:start position:0%
number is usually closer to 30 000 every
year

04:38:06.289 --> 04:38:06.299 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:38:06.299 --> 04:38:07.369 align:start position:0%
year
um

04:38:07.369 --> 04:38:07.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
so with this with this old Software
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
System again it's about 20 years old
 
04:38:13.131 --> 04:38:13.141 align:start position:0%
it's limping along at this point
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
um with uh aging software there's always
 
04:38:19.369 --> 04:38:19.379 align:start position:0%
an increased risk of failure or uh or
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
other sort of
 
04:38:23.090 --> 04:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
um issues that might happen that'll
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
potentially stop the the software in its
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
tracks essentially if there were if
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
there were any sort of failure with the
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
system would be catastrophic for the
 
04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
assistance program so you can imagine
 
04:38:33.650 --> 04:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
trying to do all these things manually
 
04:38:35.631 --> 04:38:35.641 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have the amount of staff to
 
04:38:36.890 --> 04:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
actually be able to do it you need the
 
04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
software system to do a lot of that
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting
 
04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
uh second uh as we as I mentioned the
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements again
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
these are 100 federal funds
 
04:38:48.410 --> 04:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
um as time has gone on the federal
 
04:38:50.090 --> 04:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements have increased
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
year over year over year
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
um resulting in uh in increased workload
 
04:38:56.209 --> 04:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
both at the Community Action Agency
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
level as well as the department of
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
energy to make sure that we are filing
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
those reports and the correct
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
information is in it we've heard from
 
04:39:05.689 --> 04:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
colleagues in other states of uh you
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
know their Data Systems they're able to
 
04:39:09.051 --> 04:39:09.061 align:start position:0%
push a button and they get the data that
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
they may need out for a report
 
04:39:12.529 --> 04:39:12.539 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for us it can take up to a
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
week working with our software folks to
 
04:39:16.010 --> 04:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
actually be able to get the data pulled
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to complete these required
 
04:39:19.310 --> 04:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
Federal reports
 
04:39:20.689 --> 04:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
um thankfully with these newer software
 
04:39:22.490 --> 04:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
systems it's literally a push of a
 
04:39:23.570 --> 04:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
button I'm probably grossly
 
04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying it but essentially it's
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's much easier than the current system
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and lastly there's increased efficiency
 
04:39:31.131 --> 04:39:31.141 align:start position:0%
and functionality
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
um with more efficient software that
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
frees up additional time especially the
 
04:39:35.929 --> 04:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
Community Action Agency level to be
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
processing applications working with
 
04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
clients talking to folks about other
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
programs they may be eligible for and
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
then of course the department of energy
 
04:39:47.208 --> 04:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
you get increased efficiencies in terms
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
of okay if you're not waiting a week to
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
get data pulled you can get those
 
04:39:52.368 --> 04:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
reports compiled faster we can dedicate
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
more time to managing the program making
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
sure that every dollar is spent in a an
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and efficient way
 
04:40:00.060 --> 04:40:01.430 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and efficient way
um so

04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:40:05.090 --> 04:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I will say that uh thankfully every
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
other state in the Union has similar
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
programs weatherization fuel assistance
 
04:40:08.458 --> 04:40:09.590 align:start position:0%
programs weatherization fuel assistance
programs

04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
um so software there are a number of
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
vendors who create and build software
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
specifically for these two programs and
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
they need the interactions that happen
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
in between them so it is a fairly
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf product that can be
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
acquired from a variety of vendors which
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
will hopefully reduce some of course
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
some customization will be needed but
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
it'll dramatically reduce
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
um it's not a long lead time we're not
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
custom building software we're not doing
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
anything more complex it's a fairly off
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
the shelf product which will cut down an
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
implementation time as well as cost so
 
04:40:42.890 --> 04:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
with that I will conclude and happy to
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
take any questions the committee may
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you gentlemen my my first
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
question so it's 100 Federal there's
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's no State match here in in this
 
04:40:54.890 --> 04:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
funding that is correct and when you
 
04:40:56.690 --> 04:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
talk to your colleagues throughout the
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
country where is this is every state
 
04:41:01.490 --> 04:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
getting this amount of money to
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
typically or where do we fall when we
 
04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
get our our Highway money coming back to
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
us New Hampshire falls right at that
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
bottom have you had any conversations to
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
see where we are does every state
 
04:41:17.090 --> 04:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
depending on scale get something near
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
this amount
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
um it will depend on the state there's
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually for for a lie Heap itself or
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program it is a very
 
04:41:28.128 --> 04:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
complex formula that's determined by U.S
 
04:41:30.010 --> 04:41:30.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
there are cold weather States versus
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
warm weather States
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
um as it also does for uh electric
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
assistance for folks for example if
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
you're in Florida you really don't need
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
heating but you know electric uh benefit
 
04:41:44.570 --> 04:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
to reduce how much it costs to air
 
04:41:46.010 --> 04:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
condition your home obviously makes a
 
04:41:46.020 --> 04:41:46.690 align:start position:0%
condition your home obviously makes a
difference

04:41:46.690 --> 04:41:46.700 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a sort of a complex waiting
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
formula I can't say off the top of my
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
head if we get more or less based on
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
that but being a cold weather State I
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
would think we would probably tend to
 
04:41:57.530 --> 04:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
lean a little bit more than we would
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:42:01.730 --> 04:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you questions yes representative
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
Jack thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again let me ask
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
the question a slightly different way uh
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
is there some risk that if you these
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
apparently are not funds that you can
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
just go and say we need these and you
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
get them you have to there has there's
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
some allocation going on and there's a
 
04:42:22.368 --> 04:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
um this would come out of our regular
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
allocation of federal LIHEAP or federal
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance or federal
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
weatherization funds um it's allowable
 
04:42:32.448 --> 04:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
use for these funds um so we know we
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
have the money we have it here there's
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
no there's no risk of that we would then
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
expend these and then be coming back
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
which if I could conclude you the train
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
of thought we wouldn't be asking the
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
general fund to make up the difference
 
04:42:46.368 --> 04:42:46.378 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
yes please representative Newton thank
 
04:42:50.570 --> 04:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:42:52.970 --> 04:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
question could you give me a snapshot of
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
say the last five years with this
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
program is it just plugging along at
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
about the same percentage of numbers or
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
are you seeing a major uptick or if you
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
could answer that it might be an unfair
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
question to ask you I'm not sure sure so
 
04:43:09.170 --> 04:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
for this year it gets a little bit
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
complicated um and I can't recall if you
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
were if this is your first term or if
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
you've been if you've been a
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative for a while
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
um however um you may recall that um
 
04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2023 passed last year that
 
04:43:23.208 --> 04:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
required the department to set up these
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
additional assistance the state
 
04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
assistance emergency assistance programs
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
that were using the same system so a lot
 
04:43:32.690 --> 04:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
of times the at the um the applications
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
all go through the same process so we've
 
04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
seen higher enrollment numbers this year
 
04:43:39.230 --> 04:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
because we're we see both both programs
 
04:43:41.330 --> 04:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
both happening simultaneously within the
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
same system if you look over the last
 
04:43:46.010 --> 04:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
five years or so sort of taking that
 
04:43:47.690 --> 04:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
anonymous out
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
um enrollment in these programs
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
weatherization less so that tends to be
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
more pretty much pretty standard
 
04:43:57.230 --> 04:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance really depends on how
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
the larger economy is doing being that
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
it's tied to median State median income
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
um during times of when there's higher
 
04:44:06.890 --> 04:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
unemployment we see higher numbers of
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment if you see better Economic
 
04:44:11.930 --> 04:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
Times you see decline in enrollments but
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
on average for the last couple of years
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
we've been going right around 24 000
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
households who have been served we
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
expect you know probably once all the
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
dust settles between the new
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
um uh with the new emergency assistance
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
programs we expect that number to be a
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
little bit higher especially with the
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase in fuel costs more folks
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
there's really a great sense of Yankee
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
frugality in this day where folks don't
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
want to necessarily take the help but a
 
04:44:38.448 --> 04:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
lot of times you know when they see
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
increased fuel prices they're a little
 
04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
more willing to come into to get this
 
04:44:43.620 --> 04:44:47.868 align:start position:0%
more willing to come into to get this
benefit

04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.970 --> 04:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you again why don't I ask one more
 
04:44:51.410 --> 04:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
question relating to your lapse
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
extension since we have a few minutes uh
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
it starts out in 17 and it's been
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
extended since then uh and I thought I
 
04:45:00.830 --> 04:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
heard understood you to say now there's
 
04:45:02.330 --> 04:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
an off-the-shelf thing you can get so
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
what have we been doing since 2017 on
 
04:45:07.010 --> 04:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
this project
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
um I will say I just started with the
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
Department in 2021 so I don't have I've
 
04:45:14.448 --> 04:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
got a sort of a sense of the
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
institutional Knowledge from folks
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
who've been around
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 was the original
 
04:45:23.690 --> 04:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um uh request for the 316 000 again all
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
100 federal funds uh there was of course
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
a change in administration you moved
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
from uh Governor had now Senate U.S
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
senator Hassan's Administration to the
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
sununu administration you have a
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
changeover in staff of the former office
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
of strategic initiatives
 
04:45:40.490 --> 04:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
um work had begun to progress on uh
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
working through that so there was the
 
04:45:45.288 --> 04:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
extension in 2019 to allow that uh
 
04:45:48.650 --> 04:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
drafting of that RFP to continue uh the
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
former OSI had issued a
 
04:45:54.948 --> 04:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
um an RFI request for information for
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
this software as well as an RFP for a
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
consultant to assist with drafting the
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
RFP for this software and then of course
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh covet hits a lot of the staff from
 
04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
OSI were then detailed to assist with
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
with gopher
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
as those emergency programs were getting
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
stood up with the the influx of federal
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
funds then of course you have the
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
creation of the department followed by
 
04:46:17.868 --> 04:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
the emergency assistance programs the
 
04:46:20.208 --> 04:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
department stood up last summer so you
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
can sort of see there's sort of been a
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
series of of obstacles
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
um uh sort of outside of the
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
Department's control to
 
04:46:27.780 --> 04:46:28.330 align:start position:0%
Department's control to
um

04:46:28.330 --> 04:46:28.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to sort of move forward on
 
04:46:32.208 --> 04:46:32.218 align:start position:0%
this software project I am though I am
 
04:46:35.448 --> 04:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
happy to say we are well into the uh
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
developing the uh scope scoping of the
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
various criteria that are needed for
 
04:46:41.570 --> 04:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
each of these various programs actually
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
before coming over here I just had a
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
meeting with our folks on the
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
weatherization side to see how well that
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
was going
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
um we're progressing along and we're
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
going to be reaching out to the
 
04:46:51.890 --> 04:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies which will be
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
our next step to talk to them about what
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman you mentioned that
 
04:47:06.288 --> 04:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
the software packages are caught it's
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
commercially available off the shelf
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
is that more than one developer for
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
these types of programs and I'm guessing
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
they do a little more than just around
 
04:47:18.890 --> 04:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
the country than just energy or uh fuel
 
04:47:22.250 --> 04:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
assistance Etc so you'll be will you be
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
bidding or will this be a sole source oh
 
04:47:26.270 --> 04:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
no we expect this to be competitively
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
bid um there are a number of companies I
 
04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
can I believe there are at least three
 
04:47:31.368 --> 04:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head
 
04:47:34.250 --> 04:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
um but as you mentioned a lot of states
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
will use these across their uh HHS
 
04:47:37.080 --> 04:47:38.330 align:start position:0%
will use these across their uh HHS
various

04:47:38.330 --> 04:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
various
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh uh assistance programs so there's
 
04:47:43.090 --> 04:47:43.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of sort of the same infrastructure
 
04:47:45.170 --> 04:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
but for the for New Hampshire we're
 
04:47:46.730 --> 04:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
looking at using it just for these these
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
two programs and just just three
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh so any upgrades
 
04:47:56.330 --> 04:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
um any software patches will be easily
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh downloaded or obtained or obtained uh
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
going forward I would guess yes so there
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
would probably be some sort of service
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
contract that would go along with this I
 
04:48:09.410 --> 04:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't know thank you thank you yes uh
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative balone
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:48:14.208 --> 04:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:48:16.610 --> 04:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
so how do you get to 884 thousand
 
04:48:16.620 --> 04:48:18.288 align:start position:0%
so how do you get to 884 thousand
dollars

04:48:18.288 --> 04:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
um so this is something we we actually
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
did a survey of a couple of different
 
04:48:24.770 --> 04:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
um vendors to say here's what we're
 
04:48:26.810 --> 04:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
looking at just sort of in Broad broad
 
04:48:28.970 --> 04:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
terms of the kind of software we're
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and this was sort of a rough average
 
04:48:34.250 --> 04:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the quotes that came back from
 
04:48:36.530 --> 04:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
vendors of this who provide these kinds
 
04:48:38.090 --> 04:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
of services
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
may I follow
 
04:48:46.730 --> 04:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up please represent
 
04:48:50.270 --> 04:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay so how do you break that down
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
so you just went to a vendor and they
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
just said 884 I'm sorry I'm just at this
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm used to getting a little more
 
04:48:58.970 --> 04:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
information about how that builds up to
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
880 so one part uh consultation is it
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:17.208 --> 04:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh yes so this is just for example of
 
04:49:19.490 --> 04:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
one of the software companies um that we
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
have uh that we reached out to when we
 
04:49:23.690 --> 04:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
were doing this initial uh request for
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
information again this was from April of
 
04:49:27.050 --> 04:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
last year so these numbers will probably
 
04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
need to be updated at some point and I'm
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
sure we'll probably talk to your Senate
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues about uh about potentially
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
um if there have been any increases
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
since then to get a better number
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
um but for our implementation and
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
Licensing of fully configured software
 
04:49:45.170 --> 04:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
out of the box 650 000 optimization
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
customizations or external interfaces
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
another 150 000 and then there's a
 
04:49:52.250 --> 04:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
monthly software maintenance and support
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
and hosting fees that go along in
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
just about seven thousand dollars a
 
04:49:57.360 --> 04:49:58.570 align:start position:0%
just about seven thousand dollars a
month

04:49:58.570 --> 04:49:58.580 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:50:01.250 --> 04:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so that would that would be
 
04:50:02.690 --> 04:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars so again that
 
04:50:03.890 --> 04:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
would be broken up over the over the
 
04:50:05.690 --> 04:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
course of a year yeah thank you you're
 
04:50:05.700 --> 04:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
course of a year yeah thank you you're
welcome

04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you gentlemen
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you
 
04:50:15.000 --> 05:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you

05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now sorry about that I'm
 
05:01:16.850 --> 05:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
still not used to this mic so bear with
 
05:01:18.650 --> 05:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
me and if you could please introduce
 
05:01:24.730 --> 05:01:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Lori Weaver I
 
05:01:29.868 --> 05:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
am the interim commissioner for the
 
05:01:33.890 --> 05:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%

thank you for having us here today we
 
05:01:46.490 --> 05:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
have a brief presentation for our two
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
approved capital
 
05:01:48.958 --> 05:01:50.628 align:start position:0%
approved capital
projects

05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:01:52.690 --> 05:01:52.700 align:start position:0%
my water bottle is not going to stand up
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
so I have a team I have Nathan here I
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%

05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
Information Services director so I will
 
05:02:00.650 --> 05:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
get us started and give you an overview
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then I will turn it over to go
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
through the detailed requests and then
 
05:02:07.250 --> 05:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for those of you thank you please
 
05:02:08.520 --> 05:02:09.590 align:start position:0%
um for those of you thank you please
proceed

05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
05:02:11.930 --> 05:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you but for those of you that may
 
05:02:13.850 --> 05:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
not be familiar with the Department the
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
first slide is our mission statement
 
05:02:18.170 --> 05:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
basically why we exist in um and who
 
05:02:19.730 --> 05:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
we're serving and it's really about our
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
population uh most vulnerable population
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it's about health
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
needs human needs and protection and
 
05:02:30.410 --> 05:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's a some sentences here in terms
 
05:02:32.090 --> 05:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
of describing all of it but basically
 
05:02:35.090 --> 05:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for ensuring that our
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable population has served if
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
you flip to the next slide
 
05:02:44.570 --> 05:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
slide 3 is a way to sort of chunk out
 
05:02:46.010 --> 05:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
the department I'm sure you've heard
 
05:02:47.570 --> 05:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
that the department is the largest state
 
05:02:50.270 --> 05:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
agency what exactly do we do we do a lot
 
05:02:52.330 --> 05:02:52.340 align:start position:0%
of different work we do have Direct
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
Services delivery to clients which is
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
that first bullet we have 11 district
 
05:03:00.288 --> 05:03:00.298 align:start position:0%
offices throughout our state where we
 
05:03:02.570 --> 05:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
have our staff engaging with the public
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
via case management and client services
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
but we also have direct care which is
 
05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
that third bullet and I will just bring
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
to your attention there is a error here
 
05:03:14.390 --> 05:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you could just so note that our
 
05:03:15.890 --> 05:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
Direct Services include New Hampshire
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
hospital glencliffe home the designated
 
05:03:21.890 --> 05:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
receiving facility listed is no longer
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
you can cross that off that was in
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
Laconia and we sold that property and we
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
closed that program two years ago you
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
can replace it with Hampstead Hospital
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Facility Center
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
which is the state bought Hampstead
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital a year ago
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
and currently have that property we have
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
the sununu Youth Services Center and we
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
also have what you may hear as path
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
p-a-t-h which is our Philbrook adult
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
transitional housing program so through
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
those five uh locations we actually
 
05:03:55.970 --> 05:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
service clients and we're responsible
 
05:03:57.730 --> 05:03:57.740 align:start position:0%
for the property
 
05:04:00.110 --> 05:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
and all that comes with it so it's not
 
05:04:01.850 --> 05:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
just client delivery it's also the
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
logistics on the property we're all
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
about protection so there's adult
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
protection and Child Protection the
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
department does regulatory oversight so
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
we are responsible for licensing CMS
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
facilities Health Facilities child care
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and so on we do a lot of
 
05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
Education through our public and
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
providers on our systems of care as well
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
as public health services and obviously
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring program and operational
 
05:04:29.650 --> 05:04:29.660 align:start position:0%
Integrity so that is probably the
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
most Cliff note version of what the
 
05:04:33.410 --> 05:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
department does there's obviously a lot
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
more to it but in in the context of
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget we have submitted for
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:04:38.878 --> 05:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
this year
um

05:04:39.530 --> 05:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
numerous project requests and were
 
05:04:44.030 --> 05:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
granted two in the governor's budget
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
which we are here to speak about today
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
which is our dcyfc West which is our
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system Bridges
 
05:04:53.868 --> 05:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
modernization and electronic health
 
05:04:53.878 --> 05:04:55.070 align:start position:0%
modernization and electronic health
records

05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
records
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
so if there aren't any further questions
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
I could turn it over to our Information
 
05:05:04.250 --> 05:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
Services director Dave Wieters please do
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
good after
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
sorry good afternoon my name is David
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
Wieters Information Services director
 
05:05:25.690 --> 05:05:25.700 align:start position:0%
for Health and Human Services thank you
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
05:05:27.840 --> 05:05:28.850 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
for

05:05:28.850 --> 05:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
for having me here and I'm going to
 
05:05:34.610 --> 05:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
speak to you about a couple I.T capital
 
05:05:36.770 --> 05:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
projects that you may have already heard
 
05:05:39.230 --> 05:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
about about a week and a half ago from
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet on his presentation
 
05:05:44.570 --> 05:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
so hopefully not duplicating too much
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
but the first one on slide four is the
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
Child Welfare information the
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive child welfare information
 
05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
system so this this particular Capital
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
project is the third time that we're
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
coming for capital for essentially a
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
six-year program so we've had two other
 
05:06:07.010 --> 05:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
capital projects that we went for in
 
05:06:09.288 --> 05:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
previous bienniums that support this
 
05:06:11.930 --> 05:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
six-year transition to a modernized
 
05:06:11.940 --> 05:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
six-year transition to a modernized
system

05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's replacing a 23 year old system that
 
05:06:18.410 --> 05:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
was written in a power Builder which is
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
an older programming language that
 
05:06:22.368 --> 05:06:22.378 align:start position:0%
really isn't supported anymore and we're
 
05:06:24.890 --> 05:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
having difficulty hiring new staff to
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
support and with the goal of modernizing
 
05:06:30.288 --> 05:06:30.298 align:start position:0%
that system to not only enable the
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
caseworkers to work in the field but
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
make them more productive in the sense
 
05:06:37.490 --> 05:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
of having self-service functionality
 
05:06:39.770 --> 05:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
having access to the information when
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're in the field with the the
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
families and the children so that they
 
05:06:46.970 --> 05:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
um they don't have to come back to the
 
05:06:49.250 --> 05:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
office to get information printed out go
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
back out in the field some of the
 
05:06:52.970 --> 05:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
modernizations over the last two decades
 
05:06:55.550 --> 05:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
have enabled those kind of functions and
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking to upgrade that this
 
05:07:01.368 --> 05:07:01.378 align:start position:0%
particular system or project for this
 
05:07:04.730 --> 05:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
next two bienniums is for 11 million 270
 
05:07:07.610 --> 05:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
800 and will be fifty percent federal
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
funds and 50 General funds we partner
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the administration for children and
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
families for that Federal funding
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
and throughout this process have been
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
continuing to provide them reports and
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
updates as we move along
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
the key improvements that we that I sort
 
05:07:28.250 --> 05:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
of addressed but it directly will
 
05:07:30.730 --> 05:07:30.740 align:start position:0%
provide that automated system for 700
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
workers and supporting over 5 800 cases
 
05:07:36.770 --> 05:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
per year
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
as well as a total of 45 000 people
 
05:07:43.128 --> 05:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
served over over the duration so this
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
replacement will really enable us to
 
05:07:48.288 --> 05:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
move that forward address
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
um current manual on processing as well
 
05:07:54.788 --> 05:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
as legislatively align with our Federal
 
05:07:57.770 --> 05:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
Acts that are requiring us to implement
 
05:08:00.288 --> 05:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
this comprehensive Toronto well Fair
 
05:08:02.650 --> 05:08:02.660 align:start position:0%
information system
 
05:08:05.090 --> 05:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to move to the next
 
05:08:08.090 --> 05:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
one unless there's any questions on the
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I'm not sure if I heard
 
05:08:17.570 --> 05:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
you correctly did you say that you were
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.530 --> 05:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
there was something about a staffing
 
05:08:24.540 --> 05:08:27.350 align:start position:0%
there was something about a staffing
issue

05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:30.850 --> 05:08:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.448 --> 05:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
um day Staffing challenge was supporting
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Legacy software and the way it was
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
developed was in an old technology so
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining the resources to support
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
that is difficult you may another
 
05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
reference is like a Mainframe
 
05:08:51.530 --> 05:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
programming Mainframe programmers are
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
hard to come by and so we're trying to
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
essentially just like you do with
 
05:08:57.470 --> 05:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and Roads you have a useful
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
life for I.T systems and that system is
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
normally about seven to ten years we're
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
at 23 years and so people that can
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually support that system are few and
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
far between whereas the new modern
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
technology it's easier to find people to
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
support develop and design those
 
05:09:17.090 --> 05:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
Solutions as well as maintain them
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh represent Boger
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
so you indicated it was 50 percent
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
funded so I can understand this
 
05:09:29.930 --> 05:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
being as simple than I am does that mean
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
this whole program's 22 million or does
 
05:09:37.368 --> 05:09:37.378 align:start position:0%
that mean it's our stake in it is like
 
05:09:37.378 --> 05:09:40.310 align:start position:0%
that mean it's our stake in it is like
6.5

05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
because I see on the slide on number
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
four it says 11 million and change and
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
then it says 50 funding so it does 11
 
05:09:52.970 --> 05:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
mil you understand what I'm asking yeah
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
tap thank you
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:09:58.850 --> 05:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
um the answer is that's the total amount
 
05:10:02.570 --> 05:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
so it's 11.27 and change total and the
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
general fund amount would be 5 million
 
05:10:06.050 --> 05:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
six hundred thirty five thousand four
 
05:10:09.010 --> 05:10:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.770 --> 05:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.530 --> 05:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so that the second capital
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
project that you see before you on Slide
 
05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
Five is electronic health record system
 
05:10:26.448 --> 05:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
this one is for a total amount of 19
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
million five hundred and fifty thousand
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and I'll get you the estimated
 
05:10:33.890 --> 05:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
General funds amount in a moment
 
05:10:37.850 --> 05:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
um but that system is really to allow us
 
05:10:40.010 --> 05:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
and as you heard earlier from the
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner Lori Weaver where
 
05:10:43.970 --> 05:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
we have multiple Direct Care Facilities
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's to take those systems and come up
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the strategy to leverage one
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
electronic health record system as
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to multiple
 
05:10:53.930 --> 05:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
so in hospitals across the country
 
05:10:56.690 --> 05:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
they've implemented large systems to
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
manage their medical records effectively
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
and efficiently between their point of
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
care services and this is taking that
 
05:11:06.010 --> 05:11:06.020 align:start position:0%
strategy into the state of New Hampshire
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
instead of having a different solution
 
05:11:10.610 --> 05:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
for our New Hampshire hospital and
 
05:11:13.010 --> 05:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
another solution for Hampstead Hospital
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
as well as our clean Cliff facility
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the opportunity to
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
leverage a standardized approach of
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
electronic health record system to
 
05:11:26.270 --> 05:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
provide those solutions for all of those
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
areas as well as be able to expand it to
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
our Behavioral Health area
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
for to replace an it's over 25 year old
 
05:11:38.570 --> 05:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
web information technology system that
 
05:11:40.730 --> 05:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
is currently outsourced to an another
 
05:11:44.288 --> 05:11:44.298 align:start position:0%
vendor using a.net development
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
that this proposed solution will be
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
supporting 2000 users across those
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
different Direct Care Facilities
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
and also embracing 300 external agencies
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we contract with currently today
 
05:12:02.448 --> 05:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
that replacement will allow us to really
 
05:12:04.670 --> 05:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
maximize our privacy and security and
 
05:12:07.250 --> 05:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
the reason why that is as a truth is
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
it's when you build multiple different
 
05:12:11.810 --> 05:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
systems that do the same thing and you
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
duplicate the effort it gives you the
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
opportunities to have more errors and
 
05:12:19.490 --> 05:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
our goal of having one system is we can
 
05:12:21.770 --> 05:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
build one very robust solution using
 
05:12:24.530 --> 05:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
utilizing the resources that we have to
 
05:12:27.890 --> 05:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
effectively not only make the services
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
of point of care more effective but also
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
streamline the privacy and security
 
05:12:31.980 --> 05:12:33.470 align:start position:0%
streamline the privacy and security
components

05:12:33.470 --> 05:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
components
 
05:12:35.208 --> 05:12:35.218 align:start position:0%
and then of course the last part is
 
05:12:37.730 --> 05:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
improved access to the data which really
 
05:12:40.250 --> 05:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
results in improved patient outcomes
 
05:12:40.260 --> 05:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
results in improved patient outcomes
overall

05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.448 --> 05:12:47.458 align:start position:0%
and that general fundament or this
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget is 13 million six hundred
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
and eighty five thousand dollars
 
05:12:55.010 --> 05:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the remaining would be federal funds
 
05:12:56.208 --> 05:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:56.218 --> 05:12:56.930 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
I had have we spent money for this or
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
this health records program or been
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
proposed in past Capital budgets it
 
05:13:13.430 --> 05:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
seems like the same same request keeps
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
coming back is this a different or is
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
this the first time this has been
 
05:13:21.890 --> 05:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:24.170 --> 05:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question chairman um
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
in previous bienniums we submitted
 
05:13:28.930 --> 05:13:28.940 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets to improve the existing
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
netsmart electronic medical record
 
05:13:33.288 --> 05:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
system that supports New Hampshire
 
05:13:33.298 --> 05:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
system that supports New Hampshire
hospital

05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
but those Capital budgets did not
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
contemplate the acquisition of Hampstead
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hospital nor supporting the behavioral
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
health components with the area agencies
 
05:13:48.410 --> 05:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
or glencliffe and so in in potential and
 
05:13:49.730 --> 05:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
I didn't mention it earlier they're
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital that were looking to
 
05:13:54.890 --> 05:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
build out over the next year okay thank
 
05:13:54.900 --> 05:13:55.610 align:start position:0%
build out over the next year okay thank
you

05:13:55.610 --> 05:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
for other questions at this time
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Chad thank
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
you uh so with the
 
05:14:05.390 --> 05:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
software modernizations with their
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
health records and uh
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
the other upgrades just include
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
devices to go out into the field with
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
such as laptops and um handhelds when
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
you go do your case management and
 
05:14:21.000 --> 05:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
you go do your case management and
intake

05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
intake
 
05:14:25.250 --> 05:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question currently all
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
of our field workers are already already
 
05:14:31.010 --> 05:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
have established cell phones and laptops
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
like you see that I have here today for
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
them to be able to work in the field
 
05:14:36.770 --> 05:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
however they don't have a system from
 
05:14:39.170 --> 05:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
which they can connect to and so this
 
05:14:40.970 --> 05:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
this Capital project for the sea with
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
solution and the electronic health
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
record system provides that software or
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Cloud solution that they would use
 
05:14:50.090 --> 05:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
those existing Hardware infrastructure
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
to connect to so the capital would not
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
be funding
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
that Hardware because they already have
 
05:14:59.090 --> 05:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
it and we do have it in our operating as
 
05:15:01.368 --> 05:15:01.378 align:start position:0%
a part of a useful life of a four and
 
05:15:04.330 --> 05:15:04.340 align:start position:0%
five year replacement program thank you
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
just brief follow-up chairman thank you
 
05:15:06.600 --> 05:15:07.490 align:start position:0%
just brief follow-up chairman thank you
and

05:15:07.490 --> 05:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:11.330 --> 05:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh service contract along with the
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
these upgrades and the ability to
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
upgrade ease easily
 
05:15:19.128 --> 05:15:19.138 align:start position:0%
is that included as well
 
05:15:21.010 --> 05:15:21.020 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative Terrace um you're you're
 
05:15:26.090 --> 05:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
indicating yes will this result in a
 
05:15:27.650 --> 05:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
contract that they would maintain and
 
05:15:30.050 --> 05:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
operate and upgrade the system while we
 
05:15:32.570 --> 05:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
were subscribing to or paying for it and
 
05:15:34.368 --> 05:15:34.378 align:start position:0%
if that is the nature of your question
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
then yes it would include that in the
 
05:15:38.448 --> 05:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of our requirements
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
for the Improvement thank you
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:15:47.090 --> 05:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
so at this point I'm going to go ahead
 
05:15:50.930 --> 05:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
and turn it over to Tammy Nelson our
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
facilities director to go over our
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
slide six and
 
05:16:02.208 --> 05:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
and uh just as one point of clarity the
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
first two projects that Dave Wieters
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
just spoke to those were included in the
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget the
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
Glencliff wastewater treatment
 
05:16:16.850 --> 05:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
Improvement item it was requested but it
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
was not approved and and we're here
 
05:16:20.750 --> 05:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
today just to make a request that that'd
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
be considered thank you
 
05:16:25.610 --> 05:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
so you're actually going to get me
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
before Tammy I don't have all the
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
expertise that a facilities director may
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
have on this project but I did want to
 
05:16:35.448 --> 05:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
convey uh the seriousness and of not
 
05:16:38.330 --> 05:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
fixing this particular issue of the
 
05:16:40.490 --> 05:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment this is a capital
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
project that's been in play since 2017.
 
05:16:46.510 --> 05:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's on the last leg of getting this
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement done we were not included in
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
the capital budget we've asked for Opera
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
money we've sought out a lot of funding
 
05:16:56.930 --> 05:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
for this including a des Grant which
 
05:16:58.570 --> 05:16:58.580 align:start position:0%
we've been granted for
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
368 thousand dollars so when we look at
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of the 1.8 it would be
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
minus the 368 as well as at this point I
 
05:17:10.850 --> 05:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
know we're coming back next week to
 
05:17:13.850 --> 05:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
speak with you about ongoing projects if
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's any money in there that could be
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
considered to put towards this we have
 
05:17:19.610 --> 05:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh we have clients there that live there
 
05:17:21.410 --> 05:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the risk of this system failure is
 
05:17:23.690 --> 05:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
just not acceptable for those living
 
05:17:26.330 --> 05:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
there so I it's a really old system the
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
facilities self-sustaining and it I I
 
05:17:31.970 --> 05:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
would hate to see what would happen if
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
if that failed and like I said we're 90
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
done with the project so just asking for
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.840 --> 05:17:43.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:43.368 --> 05:17:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:47.330 --> 05:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
my um it would seem I I've we've heard
 
05:17:47.340 --> 05:17:48.230 align:start position:0%
my um it would seem I I've we've heard
this

05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
time after time
 
05:17:54.410 --> 05:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
um this wastewater treatment Improvement
 
05:17:54.420 --> 05:17:55.788 align:start position:0%
um this wastewater treatment Improvement
um

05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
I I question why arpa funds aren't
 
05:18:01.970 --> 05:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this purpose and uh was
 
05:18:03.650 --> 05:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
it just that someone made a
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
determination that their need was
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
greater than your need do you have any
 
05:18:09.650 --> 05:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
background on that I can tell you that I
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
know that the request was within the
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
bounds of the Our Fair limits so that is
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
why we put the request forward because
 
05:18:19.128 --> 05:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
it was an allowable ask I'm obviously
 
05:18:20.930 --> 05:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
not in the deciding end so I don't know
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
if there was another pressing need that
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
took place over this one but to us it
 
05:18:27.650 --> 05:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
made sense that this would come out of
 
05:18:30.288 --> 05:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
that funding source the only reason I
 
05:18:33.650 --> 05:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
asked is our County alone received nine
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
point something million dollars and we
 
05:18:37.970 --> 05:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
were one of the the lowest of all the
 
05:18:39.948 --> 05:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
counties on the money of which we spent
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
over two million dollars to study and
 
05:18:45.890 --> 05:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
modernize our water system
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
um do you could you tell me if was this
 
05:18:51.410 --> 05:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
something you folks Glenn Cliff put
 
05:18:53.628 --> 05:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
together are you relied on Des to follow
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
this project
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
well it's really a partnership I mean we
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
work with um I mean obviously we're out
 
05:19:01.128 --> 05:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
of Des compliance at this point we're
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
going to start to get fined as part of
 
05:19:04.850 --> 05:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
that so you know I think Des Grant
 
05:19:06.770 --> 05:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
giving us the grant is a sign of that
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
partnership but we are required to do
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
all the legwork in terms of getting the
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
contractors uh lined up and getting the
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
scope of work and in place and happening
 
05:19:19.850 --> 05:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
no I understand that the arpa process
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
when you said you were looking into that
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
was that the who who did you go through
 
05:19:28.610 --> 05:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
that process with with gopher
 
05:19:30.288 --> 05:19:30.298 align:start position:0%
it was a Department of Health and Human
 
05:19:33.050 --> 05:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
Services request via gopher
 
05:19:36.288 --> 05:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
did we make it all the way to go for
 
05:19:39.650 --> 05:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
we we submitted our request to go for
 
05:19:42.170 --> 05:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
for that we also in our agency budget we
 
05:19:43.730 --> 05:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
included a prioritized need in the
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
um which which is not currently within
 
05:19:48.650 --> 05:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget so
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
we've we've attempted to find a number
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
of avenues to make sure that we can we
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
can get this Wastewater system replaced
 
05:19:59.288 --> 05:19:59.298 align:start position:0%
do you believe your lapses and
 
05:20:01.490 --> 05:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
representatives here on this committee
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
will be going through that on next week
 
05:20:09.770 --> 05:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
um how do you so you're somewhere you
 
05:20:12.050 --> 05:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
know 50 one one point
 
05:20:15.050 --> 05:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
or something million away do you have
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
any idea where your where your lapse
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
funds how much that might help it it's
 
05:20:22.850 --> 05:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
my intent to try to find uh sufficient
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
funds from within from within prior
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
projects to try to meet this need
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and we will have those details for
 
05:20:31.250 --> 05:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
you next Monday okay thank you any
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
05:20:39.770 --> 05:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
yes hi and the and this replacement
 
05:20:42.600 --> 05:20:44.628 align:start position:0%
yes hi and the and this replacement
there

05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:20:46.850 --> 05:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
on the improvements that you referred to
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're confident that you've got
 
05:20:51.530 --> 05:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
um contractors that will be able to do
 
05:20:56.650 --> 05:20:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.550 --> 05:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I have to look to my
 
05:21:00.890 --> 05:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
facilities director I mean I think I
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
know that the history is that we we have
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
had contractors and they're on pause in
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
terms of their availability now and
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
manpower to that I can't really speak to
 
05:21:13.208 --> 05:21:13.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I know many of us
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
know how remote your the Glencliff
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
facility is so that's why I asked the
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
I I will say I I did not have the
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
pleasure of attending our last uh
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
committee outing to your property and we
 
05:21:34.970 --> 05:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
we might want to consider that again so
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
happy to have you thank you
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
are there is there further to your
 
05:21:45.650 --> 05:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
only if if you'd wish to go through the
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
additional details in the Glen Close
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
slides um we do have some additional
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
detail of of the risks associated with
 
05:21:56.400 --> 05:21:57.708 align:start position:0%
detail of of the risks associated with
failure

05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
failure
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
um as well as some imagery in the back
 
05:22:02.090 --> 05:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
that that shows the existing Fields
 
05:22:04.368 --> 05:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
um through which you will see grass and
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
other things showing on the last page
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
that have grown up through the existing
 
05:22:11.930 --> 05:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
system there effectively compromising it
 
05:22:13.610 --> 05:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
um we can we can go through a little bit
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
more detail if you'd like but otherwise
 
05:22:18.770 --> 05:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
we're good all right
 
05:22:18.780 --> 05:22:20.090 align:start position:0%
we're good all right
I

05:22:20.090 --> 05:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:22:22.330 --> 05:22:22.340 align:start position:0%
I think we're self-explanatory
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your time thank you
 
05:22:27.770 --> 05:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing what you can
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
shake out for money
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.570 --> 05:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
so while we have a moment next Monday is
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
technically a subcommittee work session
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
there are four people who are actually
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the subcutane myself representative
 
05:22:54.830 --> 05:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
Mills Boyd and Juris anyone else is
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
welcome to come the way we have but
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're not required to uh the way we
 
05:23:01.970 --> 05:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
have run it in the past is anyone can
 
05:23:03.410 --> 05:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
listen to the presentation and ask
 
05:23:03.420 --> 05:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
listen to the presentation and ask
questions

05:23:04.490 --> 05:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:23:06.650 --> 05:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh so you're as good as on the
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if you do that we won't be
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
taking any votes what we will do is
 
05:23:12.010 --> 05:23:12.020 align:start position:0%
simply gather information
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh if you look in the back of hb25
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
page five
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
line 22 through to the end that's what
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be taking up
 
05:23:34.970 --> 05:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
and we'll be going line by line through
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
that with each agency finding out if
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
they need the money if they are done
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
with the money if there is something
 
05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
left out of the bill because it's very
 
05:23:45.050 --> 05:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
important that we have it absolutely
 
05:23:48.170 --> 05:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
correct or we get a get an agency in a
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
position where they have awarded a
 
05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
contract and they can't pay a bill
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
because their funding has lapsed
 
05:23:58.490 --> 05:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
so it's and conversely if
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
there's funding available as we just
 
05:24:04.910 --> 05:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what we'll be doing next
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
Monday you're free to come but we won't
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
be taking any votes we'll simply report
 
05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
back what we find at an appropriate
 
05:24:13.740 --> 05:24:19.550 align:start position:0%
back what we find at an appropriate
moment

05:24:19.550 --> 05:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
please the committee meets in this room
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
and at what time uh 10 o'clock I have
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
the schedule I just got the schedule
 
05:24:30.530 --> 05:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's 10 o'clock and the last agency is
 
05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
quick quick question if I could just
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:45.050 --> 05:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
a representative in you to say from
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.368 --> 05:24:54.378 align:start position:0%
now the lapse extension section is
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
section 12 it starts on page five at
 
05:25:01.010 --> 05:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
line 22 and it goes through to the end
 
05:25:01.970 --> 05:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
of the build
 
05:25:11.050 --> 05:25:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
Chris did you have something else to add
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
on that so Chris if I could while we
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
have a few minutes so we're going to
 
05:25:19.550 --> 05:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
finish today with Department of Natural
 
05:25:22.730 --> 05:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources picking up on the
 
05:25:25.490 --> 05:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
lap extensions next week
 
05:25:29.570 --> 05:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
and then where we will have heard from
 
05:25:31.550 --> 05:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at that point
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
Friday you'll have the rest of the
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioners coming in so by the end of
 
05:25:39.410 --> 05:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
Friday and today on Friday you'll have
 
05:25:41.690 --> 05:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
heard from all the agencies that had a
 
05:25:44.330 --> 05:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
request in the capital budget
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
some of those same agencies are going to
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
come back again on Monday and meet in
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
person with the subcommittee on the
 
05:25:52.970 --> 05:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions others that don't have
 
05:25:55.250 --> 05:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of lapse extension requests I have
 
05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
emailed a request for them to provide me
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
with information on their lapse
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
extension which will be shared with the
 
05:26:03.288 --> 05:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then the full committee
 
05:26:05.810 --> 05:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to cover all of that as
 
05:26:05.820 --> 05:26:07.550 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to cover all of that as
well

05:26:07.550 --> 05:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:26:09.288 --> 05:26:09.298 align:start position:0%
um so yeah by end of day or Friday
 
05:26:11.868 --> 05:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
you'll have heard from all the agencies
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
um then Monday we'll do the subcommittee
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
and then I think next Friday is when you
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to start getting into the uh the
 
05:26:20.810 --> 05:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of what this committee
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
wants to do with the the capital budget
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
so what what we typically do is we will
 
05:26:29.208 --> 05:26:29.218 align:start position:0%
start in on that following Friday and
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
we'll start at the front you've got
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 as it was drafted here and
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
we will just start at the top we'll go
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
through and we're going to find agency
 
05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
requests that we all agree with the low
 
05:26:42.890 --> 05:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit we're going to take care
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
of first we're going to go through and
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're at that and then we'll start a
 
05:26:49.550 --> 05:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on well if and once we have
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
that settled then we'll start talking
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
about you know what our priorities are
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what's in there so the
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
first first part of that is we go
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
through and we find you know the the
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
easier items the programs that are
 
05:27:07.128 --> 05:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
completely Federal funded you know does
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
everybody agree on this so that we can
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
what's happening The Liquor Commission
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that Enterprise funds
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
and so we start working on that and then
 
05:27:20.690 --> 05:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
we start narrowing in on something that
 
05:27:23.448 --> 05:27:23.458 align:start position:0%
we may want to tweak or adjust and we'll
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
start in on that fairly early so Chris
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
has time then to propose amendments
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on them as we go and the
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal by the end of next week I
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
believe is our schedule that we hope to
 
05:27:39.170 --> 05:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
have a document at that point in time
 
05:27:41.090 --> 05:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
so that just that just gives you a
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
little heads up of where we are in the
 
05:27:43.320 --> 05:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
little heads up of where we are in the
process

05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.230 --> 05:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
05:27:52.368 --> 05:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah so your goal and I
 
05:57:30.110 --> 05:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:34.010 --> 05:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
three o'clock uh thank you David our
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
three o'clock scheduled public hearing

05:58:03.708 --> 05:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and Veterans Services
 
05:58:06.048 --> 05:58:06.058 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard with me
 
05:58:08.930 --> 05:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
today is uh Judy Chen our administrator
 
05:58:10.250 --> 05:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to cover three things
 
05:58:12.410 --> 05:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
broadly one is for new committee members
 
05:58:13.788 --> 05:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
a broad overview of the New Hampshire
 
05:58:14.990 --> 05:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard
 
05:58:17.390 --> 05:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
number two is the four requests out you
 
05:58:18.530 --> 05:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
will see in front of you for the
 
05:58:20.090 --> 05:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the third item will be two
 
05:58:23.930 --> 05:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
additional requests that we're asking
 
05:58:25.850 --> 05:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
favorable um
 
05:58:28.430 --> 05:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
um favorable support from this committee
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
so first and foremost number one New
 
05:58:31.548 --> 05:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard what are we
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
we're about 3 100 strong both Army Air
 
05:58:38.330 --> 05:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
state employees and federal civilian
 
05:58:38.340 --> 05:58:39.350 align:start position:0%
state employees and federal civilian
employees

05:58:39.350 --> 05:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
1800 Army 1100 air
 
05:58:44.930 --> 05:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
1800 army soldiers are geographically
 
05:58:47.570 --> 05:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
dispersed at 17 locations throughout the
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
state you will generally see like the
 
05:58:51.708 --> 05:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester Armory the Milford Armory the
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
Littleton Armory generally speaking
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're in 17 armories throughout the
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
state those armories on state land have
 
05:59:02.810 --> 05:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
a cost share federal state match
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
um when we have maintenance facilities
 
05:59:06.048 --> 05:59:06.058 align:start position:0%
our Aviation hanger here in Concord
 
05:59:07.610 --> 05:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
those are typically 100 federally
 
05:59:07.620 --> 05:59:09.048 align:start position:0%
those are typically 100 federally
reimbursed

05:59:09.048 --> 05:59:09.058 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
05:59:10.850 --> 05:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
on the Air National Guard we're 1100
 
05:59:12.890 --> 05:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
strong all IPS are a National Guard base
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
will we have that new kc-46 refueler so
 
05:59:16.850 --> 05:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
that's just a broad overview with the
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard is when you
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
look at the four requests that were in
 
05:59:22.368 --> 05:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
the governor's capital budget
 
05:59:23.868 --> 05:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
um let's go through item by item and
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
what they are and what they entail
 
05:59:27.410 --> 05:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
so again
 
05:59:29.930 --> 05:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
um our staff has been extremely
 
05:59:32.690 --> 05:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
competitive and successful in leveraging
 
05:59:34.610 --> 05:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
federal dollars for new armories and
 
05:59:37.010 --> 05:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
facilities for the Army National Guard
 
05:59:39.288 --> 05:59:39.298 align:start position:0%
so we build new facilities on state land
 
05:59:41.330 --> 05:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
for new construction there's typically a
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
75 Federal 25 State cost share
 
05:59:45.890 --> 05:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
so you look at the first one it says
 
05:59:48.048 --> 05:59:48.058 align:start position:0%
National Readiness Center Edition
 
05:59:50.090 --> 05:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the the state cost
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
you're 75-25
 
05:59:54.890 --> 05:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
um where it says the total cost amount
 
05:59:56.628 --> 05:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
is 5 million dollars
 
05:59:58.070 --> 05:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so what we'll be doing in Nashville
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
is at our existing Armory is building on
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you go through item number two in
 
06:00:08.690 --> 06:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
Plymouth you have this is called the
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Readiness Center so again we
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
were extremely successful in competing
 
06:00:15.170 --> 06:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
in what we call the president's future
 
06:00:16.910 --> 06:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
years defense plan budget through
 
06:00:16.920 --> 06:00:18.048 align:start position:0%
years defense plan budget through
Congress

06:00:18.048 --> 06:00:18.058 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
06:00:20.090 --> 06:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
and leveraging a 25 million dollar
 
06:00:20.100 --> 06:00:21.230 align:start position:0%
and leveraging a 25 million dollar
project

06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:00:25.490 --> 06:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
75 Federal 25 State matching costs share
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
to build a brand new Armory 20 to 25 000
 
06:00:32.448 --> 06:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
the third item as you see is a Statewide
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
building improvements
 
06:00:40.128 --> 06:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we've only Built one
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
new Armory in the last 20 years and
 
06:00:43.368 --> 06:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
that's in Pembroke
 
06:00:45.470 --> 06:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of our armories as you probably
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
have seen in your communities are Cold
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
War era relics that were built in the
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
1950s and 1960s
 
06:00:54.048 --> 06:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
our two oldest ones we have one in
 
06:00:56.090 --> 06:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
Concord that was built in the 1880s and
 
06:00:57.470 --> 06:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
we have a Manchester Army that was built
 
06:00:59.330 --> 06:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
in 1935.
 
06:01:01.250 --> 06:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
so when you look at that sort of Legacy
 
06:01:03.170 --> 06:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there's a sustainment
 
06:01:05.690 --> 06:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
cost to replace roofs replace boilers
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
and just do General upkeep and
 
06:01:08.810 --> 06:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
maintenance that just keep them in
 
06:01:08.820 --> 06:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
maintenance that just keep them in
service

06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:01:11.390 --> 06:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
so item number three is when you see
 
06:01:13.850 --> 06:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
Statewide building improvements
 
06:01:15.770 --> 06:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
because it's an existing building on
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
state land it's a 50 50 state a federal
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
state cost share so that's what it is
 
06:01:22.850 --> 06:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
just like we prioritize what routes need
 
06:01:24.410 --> 06:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
to be replace what boilers need to
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
replace and go through those old armors
 
06:01:28.430 --> 06:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
and just replace those those
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
those type of systems to make sure we
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
can you know keep maintaining those
 
06:01:31.558 --> 06:01:33.288 align:start position:0%
can you know keep maintaining those
facilities

06:01:33.288 --> 06:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:01:35.208 --> 06:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
then item number four you'll see this
 
06:01:37.128 --> 06:01:37.138 align:start position:0%
labeled Nashua hazardous material
 
06:01:37.138 --> 06:01:38.930 align:start position:0%
labeled Nashua hazardous material
remediation

06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
06:01:41.090 --> 06:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
so we know from previous work done at
 
06:01:43.490 --> 06:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
our national armory that there was old
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
Tannery waste in our modal pool
 
06:01:47.570 --> 06:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
underneath the ground
 
06:01:50.330 --> 06:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
so we know there's a minor environmental
 
06:01:52.850 --> 06:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
issue there so the money we're seeking
 
06:01:55.970 --> 06:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
for is 100 General funds is to do
 
06:01:57.770 --> 06:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
environmental uh we we call it
 
06:01:59.570 --> 06:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
environmental environmental condition of
 
06:01:59.580 --> 06:02:00.708 align:start position:0%
environmental environmental condition of
property

06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:02:03.048 --> 06:02:03.058 align:start position:0%
to figure out the level of where we can
 
06:02:05.390 --> 06:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
build this edition of where that sort of
 
06:02:07.910 --> 06:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
waste lies in order for us to build a 5
 
06:02:10.990 --> 06:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
000 square foot Edition there
 
06:02:14.090 --> 06:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
generally speaking those are the four
 
06:02:16.970 --> 06:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
projects within the capital's budget now
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go to our two additional
 
06:02:20.090 --> 06:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
requests unless there's any questions
 
06:02:20.100 --> 06:02:21.288 align:start position:0%
requests unless there's any questions
now

06:02:21.288 --> 06:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
are there questions the ads in general
 
06:02:26.208 --> 06:02:26.218 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
06:02:28.368 --> 06:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
06:02:31.730 --> 06:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
so we have two additional requests
 
06:02:33.470 --> 06:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and you should have received a memo
 
06:02:36.590 --> 06:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
and it's disregard the numbers because
 
06:02:38.150 --> 06:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
it was in our original budget request
 
06:02:40.250 --> 06:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
when we did our state submission but
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we want to do is the
 
06:02:44.330 --> 06:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
first request is for a hundred and fifty
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of General funds 100
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
General funds to purchase land in
 
06:02:50.990 --> 06:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
Pembroke New Hampshire
 
06:02:52.670 --> 06:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
what we would like to do is ask the
 
06:02:54.170 --> 06:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
committee is instead of giving us four
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of 100 General
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
funds for Nashville environmental
 
06:03:01.250 --> 06:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste investigation is
 
06:03:04.010 --> 06:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
give us 250 000 there
 
06:03:05.810 --> 06:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
and move a hundred and fifty thousand
 
06:03:07.970 --> 06:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
dollars for this land purchase
 
06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know we feel a 250 000 is sufficient
 
06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
to do the environmental investigation
 
06:03:15.890 --> 06:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we need to build that addition
 
06:03:17.810 --> 06:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
and we're not seeking additional funds
 
06:03:20.448 --> 06:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
so we would just like to transfer 150
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
000 into purchase of a budding land at
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
our Pembroke facility
 
06:03:28.430 --> 06:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
so for those who may or may not know is
 
06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
um Pembroke New Hampshire is one of our
 
06:03:32.690 --> 06:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
sort of landmark facilities it's
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
relatively brand new and hosts two major
 
06:03:34.798 --> 06:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
relatively brand new and hosts two major
functions

06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
functions
 
06:03:38.090 --> 06:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
it hosts our Regional Training Institute
 
06:03:40.610 --> 06:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
in surveillance civilian parlance it's
 
06:03:41.810 --> 06:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
our schoolhouse
 
06:03:44.090 --> 06:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
so Envision a community college
 
06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
so we have the ability to teach military
 
06:03:48.650 --> 06:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
skills training to different states
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
throughout the nation so we have about a
 
06:03:52.010 --> 06:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand square foot building
 
06:03:54.170 --> 06:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
there that's classroom and dormitories
 
06:03:56.810 --> 06:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
in addition to that about three years
 
06:03:58.850 --> 06:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
ago we built a brand new Armory there
 
06:04:01.730 --> 06:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
save about 250 acres of land with three
 
06:04:03.410 --> 06:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
major buildings and a track and
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
supporting um infrastructure and there's
 
06:04:07.610 --> 06:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
two utility
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
um companies that have a budding
 
06:04:11.570 --> 06:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
property that are landlocked that we are
 
06:04:13.250 --> 06:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
pursuing um the purchase of those
 
06:04:15.530 --> 06:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
Parcels to just expand our training
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
footprint there at that facility
 
06:04:20.270 --> 06:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
the second item that you should see on
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
the um on the memo is um it should say a
 
06:04:23.520 --> 06:04:24.590 align:start position:0%
the um on the memo is um it should say a
priority

06:04:24.590 --> 06:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
priority
 
06:04:26.690 --> 06:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
um Milford Readiness Center minor melcon
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
which is a minor military construction
 
06:04:28.320 --> 06:04:29.868 align:start position:0%
which is a minor military construction
project

06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:04:31.490 --> 06:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we were approved by National Guard
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau to build a four plus million
 
06:04:36.670 --> 06:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
dollar addition in Milford New Hampshire
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
again another about 5 000 square foot
 
06:04:39.840 --> 06:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
again another about 5 000 square foot
Edition

06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
Edition
 
06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
to an existing Armory with a 75-25
 
06:04:47.570 --> 06:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
federal state cost share
 
06:04:49.788 --> 06:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
the reason why that's important number
 
06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
one is National Guard Bureau approved
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
approved of it it's in the it's in
 
06:04:55.610 --> 06:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
congress's budget so we know we have the
 
06:04:57.770 --> 06:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
federal dollars now we need a staged
 
06:04:59.628 --> 06:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
cost share it in order to build it
 
06:05:01.610 --> 06:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
second reason why it's important is it's
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
one of our largest units in the state
 
06:05:05.570 --> 06:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's our Mountain infantry company so we
 
06:05:08.270 --> 06:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
have over 125 soldiers who drill in that
 
06:05:10.010 --> 06:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
building a week in a month
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the size of the
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
building it's about 17 000 square feet
 
06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's significantly undersized for the
 
06:05:17.208 --> 06:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
amount of soldiers and equipment that
 
06:05:20.270 --> 06:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.890 --> 06:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all I
 
06:05:21.900 --> 06:05:23.570 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all I
have

06:05:23.570 --> 06:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:26.930 --> 06:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
um yes please
 
06:05:29.570 --> 06:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
so in your Nashville facility you're
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking to test where the contamination
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
is so you can figure out where to build
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
why isn't there money for remediation of
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
the contamination why are we just
 
06:05:42.410 --> 06:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
letting it sit and identifying the
 
06:05:42.420 --> 06:05:44.288 align:start position:0%
letting it sit and identifying the
locale

06:05:44.288 --> 06:05:44.298 align:start position:0%
locale
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I think the reason why is um
 
06:05:52.910 --> 06:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
if we know the degree of its location we
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh we went through this about four
 
06:05:56.510 --> 06:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
or five years ago when we did another
 
06:05:58.128 --> 06:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
Edition there
 
06:06:00.650 --> 06:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
um as long as it's capped and not
 
06:06:00.660 --> 06:06:01.788 align:start position:0%
um as long as it's capped and not
Disturbed

06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
Disturbed
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go through those costs
 
06:06:05.690 --> 06:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
to remove that material so we just want
 
06:06:07.490 --> 06:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure we know the scope
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
of area of where that material is
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
so we know when we dug up the motor pool
 
06:06:16.430 --> 06:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
five years ago we have a general idea of
 
06:06:18.170 --> 06:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
where it is and we went through
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
department environmental services you
 
06:06:21.650 --> 06:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
know and we would tell like hey you can
 
06:06:23.830 --> 06:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
just cap this and just don't touch it
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the cost
 
06:06:27.650 --> 06:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:29.330 --> 06:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent Mills so just to reiterate
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
and this is mostly for the some of the
 
06:06:36.170 --> 06:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
new members in this committee you're as
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
far as your request number your first
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
request uh you're not asking for any
 
06:06:42.770 --> 06:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
more money than that four hundred
 
06:06:44.810 --> 06:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you just want to split
 
06:06:47.448 --> 06:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
into two projects 250
 
06:06:50.270 --> 06:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
000 to remain in the original hazardous
 
06:06:53.208 --> 06:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
materials remediation product Nashua and
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
you want to take 100 the other 150 and
 
06:06:58.910 --> 06:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
apply it to a land purchase project yes
 
06:07:02.930 --> 06:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
sir thank you number two
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
what's the money involved there is that
 
06:07:06.530 --> 06:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
the entire five million six hundred
 
06:07:10.868 --> 06:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars yes okay so and again
 
06:07:14.570 --> 06:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
75-25 cost here so it's going to be 4.2
 
06:07:18.170 --> 06:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars Federal 1.4 million uh
 
06:07:20.448 --> 06:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
100 General funds
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry yeah please so that so
 
06:07:25.970 --> 06:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
basically your second request is for 1.4
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars yes thank you
 
06:07:31.730 --> 06:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack so if I could
 
06:07:33.410 --> 06:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so if I could follow up on
 
06:07:35.208 --> 06:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
that on the last page it says one
 
06:07:37.610 --> 06:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
million is a state share and that should
 
06:07:42.548 --> 06:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:45.288 --> 06:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
yes and the reason why is inflation like
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
just costly construction so we're
 
06:07:46.558 --> 06:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
just costly construction so we're
anticipating

06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
06:07:50.030 --> 06:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
once it's designed and put out the bid
 
06:07:52.010 --> 06:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a higher cost so I want
 
06:07:52.970 --> 06:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
to make sure we have the right number
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:00.890 --> 06:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
I um
 
06:08:05.330 --> 06:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
before before you leave I just want to
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
mention we have a lot of the members
 
06:08:10.490 --> 06:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
that have military time here the adjunct
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
General said he would stay for a push-up
 
06:08:12.718 --> 06:08:15.890 align:start position:0%
General said he would stay for a push-up
contest

06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%

I would ask for this wouldn't be a
 
06:08:33.410 --> 06:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
question but may I make a comment
 
06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%

06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
blur now but a couple of years ago

public
 
06:59:45.948 --> 06:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
we are very enthusiastic about the six
 
06:59:48.530 --> 06:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars allocated to dncr in the
 
06:59:50.990 --> 06:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget after we walk
 
06:59:52.490 --> 06:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
through the projects listed in the
 
06:59:54.048 --> 06:59:54.058 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget there is an
 
06:59:55.850 --> 06:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
additional category of projects I would
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
like to draw your attention to
 
07:00:00.468 --> 07:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire's portfolio of
 
07:00:03.110 --> 07:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
lands managed for Public Access there
 
07:00:05.150 --> 07:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
are many many hundreds of miles of roads
 
07:00:07.310 --> 07:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
and parking lots that are in a state of
 
07:00:07.320 --> 07:00:08.570 align:start position:0%
and parking lots that are in a state of
disrepair

07:00:08.570 --> 07:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
disrepair
 
07:00:11.330 --> 07:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
a paved parking lot at a busy Revenue
 
07:00:14.030 --> 07:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
generating State Park provides a double
 
07:00:17.390 --> 07:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency for us more striped spots
 
07:00:19.850 --> 07:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
allow for an estimated 15 percent
 
07:00:22.490 --> 07:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
increase in available parking spots and
 
07:00:24.708 --> 07:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
it frees up precious staff time from
 
07:00:26.990 --> 07:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
parking lot Duty
 
07:00:28.850 --> 07:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
in the case of the Connecticut Lakes
 
07:00:31.730 --> 07:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
Headwaters this agency has an obligation
 
07:00:34.128 --> 07:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
to complete a road management plan as
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the property easement
 
07:00:38.510 --> 07:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
we have included an informational
 
07:00:40.250 --> 07:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
handout which we would like to discuss
 
07:00:41.750 --> 07:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
today to illustrate our current
 
07:00:41.760 --> 07:00:43.128 align:start position:0%
today to illustrate our current
situation

07:00:43.128 --> 07:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
situation
 
07:00:45.170 --> 07:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
simply put we need an updated Road
 
07:00:47.090 --> 07:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
management plan and Road agreement to
 
07:00:49.430 --> 07:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
help direct and prioritize Capital funds
 
07:00:51.770 --> 07:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
and put this valuable Road system that
 
07:00:55.010 --> 07:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
supports public access to 229 square
 
07:00:57.410 --> 07:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
miles of pristine property in our
 
07:00:59.330 --> 07:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
northernmost corner of the state on a
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled maintenance program
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the category of roads and parking
 
07:01:06.830 --> 07:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
lots we are requesting 1.75 million
 
07:01:06.840 --> 07:01:08.330 align:start position:0%
lots we are requesting 1.75 million
dollars

07:01:08.330 --> 07:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:01:10.610 --> 07:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
with that I am going to ask Tom
 
07:01:12.770 --> 07:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
Mansfield who I'm sure you all recognize
 
07:01:16.368 --> 07:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
from previous Capital budgets to walk us
 
07:01:18.530 --> 07:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
through the 6 million that the governor
 
07:01:22.730 --> 07:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:24.288 --> 07:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:01:26.090 --> 07:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
the governor's capital budget request
 
07:01:27.770 --> 07:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
includes four line items for the
 
07:01:28.968 --> 07:01:28.978 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
07:01:30.708 --> 07:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
resources for a total of six million
 
07:01:30.718 --> 07:01:31.788 align:start position:0%
resources for a total of six million
dollars

07:01:31.788 --> 07:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:01:34.730 --> 07:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh I thought I would go through each one
 
07:01:36.650 --> 07:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate to take
 
07:01:38.628 --> 07:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
questions after each one or at the end
 
07:01:41.150 --> 07:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to accommodate whichever works
 
07:01:44.030 --> 07:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
best thank you
 
07:01:46.190 --> 07:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
the first slide item is for roofing and
 
07:01:46.200 --> 07:01:47.270 align:start position:0%
the first slide item is for roofing and
repairs

07:01:47.270 --> 07:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
07:01:49.670 --> 07:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
this request is our highest priority
 
07:01:52.190 --> 07:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
it covers repairs and the bird
 
07:01:53.628 --> 07:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance projects that are required
 
07:01:55.548 --> 07:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
to keep the state parks and other dncr
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
facilities operating and providing
 
07:01:59.030 --> 07:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
services to the public
 
07:02:00.830 --> 07:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
that provides a source of funding with
 
07:02:02.510 --> 07:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
enough flexibility to allow the
 
07:02:03.948 --> 07:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
department to respond to critical
 
07:02:06.770 --> 07:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
facilities failures things like water
 
07:02:08.510 --> 07:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
and sewer pump failures electrical
 
07:02:11.090 --> 07:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
outages and storm damage
 
07:02:14.030 --> 07:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
and our list of repair projects
 
07:02:14.040 --> 07:02:15.288 align:start position:0%
and our list of repair projects
uh

07:02:15.288 --> 07:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have representative projects of the
 
07:02:19.430 --> 07:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
type that we intend to address with this
 
07:02:19.440 --> 07:02:20.330 align:start position:0%
type that we intend to address with this
funding

07:02:20.330 --> 07:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
funding
 
07:02:22.430 --> 07:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
but we want to make clear that in order
 
07:02:24.410 --> 07:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
to respond to emergency situations as
 
07:02:26.690 --> 07:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
they arise it's intended that the list
 
07:02:29.270 --> 07:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
will be revised with additions
 
07:02:31.368 --> 07:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
and substitutions over the course of the
 
07:02:31.378 --> 07:02:32.930 align:start position:0%
and substitutions over the course of the
biennium

07:02:32.930 --> 07:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
07:02:35.690 --> 07:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
in the roofing component of this request
 
07:02:36.890 --> 07:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
for funding
 
07:02:39.770 --> 07:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
we would remove some 80 buildings and
 
07:02:41.690 --> 07:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
small structures which have been
 
07:02:43.730 --> 07:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
identified through our maintenance
 
07:02:45.830 --> 07:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
schedule and our database
 
07:02:48.350 --> 07:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
we know that maintaining sound roofs on
 
07:02:49.910 --> 07:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
our building inventory is the single
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
most effective step we can take to
 
07:02:53.628 --> 07:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
protect the structures and extend their
 
07:02:56.690 --> 07:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:58.548 --> 07:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
that's my summary of the first line on
 
07:03:00.468 --> 07:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
them shall I go on to the second or can
 
07:03:04.250 --> 07:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
I any uh any questions on the first item
 
07:03:06.468 --> 07:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
please continue Tom let me just remind
 
07:03:08.690 --> 07:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
people that we there was a folder passed
 
07:03:10.910 --> 07:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
out and so you can follow along in that
 
07:03:13.850 --> 07:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
folder we printed out these the six
 
07:03:18.948 --> 07:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
the second line item in the in the
 
07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget is for forest
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
and lands facilities
 
07:03:27.530 --> 07:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
this request addresses deferred
 
07:03:29.330 --> 07:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
maintenance facilities upgrades and fire
 
07:03:31.850 --> 07:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
safety improvements at five division of
 
07:03:33.468 --> 07:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
forest and lands facilities around the
 
07:03:33.478 --> 07:03:34.670 align:start position:0%
forest and lands facilities around the
state

07:03:34.670 --> 07:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:03:36.770 --> 07:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
the most significant project in the
 
07:03:38.750 --> 07:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
group is a set of upgrades at the State
 
07:03:40.788 --> 07:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
Forest Nursery in Boston
 
07:03:43.968 --> 07:03:43.978 align:start position:0%
the nursery in bosquin is enjoying a
 
07:03:45.830 --> 07:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
surge in sales
 
07:03:49.850 --> 07:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
in the period from 2018 to 2022
 
07:03:53.150 --> 07:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the number of sales that they
 
07:03:56.690 --> 07:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
made went up by 199 percent
 
07:04:00.830 --> 07:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the revenue went up 248 percent
 
07:04:03.250 --> 07:04:03.260 align:start position:0%
so I guess you could say we're trying to
 
07:04:07.810 --> 07:04:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:15.048 --> 07:04:15.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:17.150 --> 07:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
the main thing we want to do for the
 
07:04:19.968 --> 07:04:19.978 align:start position:0%
nursery in Boston is to put out a new
 
07:04:22.610 --> 07:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
seedling storage cooler the seedlings
 
07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
when they get taken out of the ground
 
07:04:26.330 --> 07:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
have to be kept cool and moist while
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're being processed sorted and
 
07:04:30.890 --> 07:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
shipped out so right now we have a
 
07:04:33.590 --> 07:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
lean-to off the existing Barn
 
07:04:36.770 --> 07:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
and uh unfortunately the roof structure
 
07:04:39.590 --> 07:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
was broken by falling snow and the walls
 
07:04:42.110 --> 07:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
our fractured concrete block
 
07:04:43.910 --> 07:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and there's not enough square footage in
 
07:04:45.530 --> 07:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
it so in order to accommodate all the
 
07:04:46.730 --> 07:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
seedlings that they're trying to sell
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
they've expanded into the space of the
 
07:04:51.708 --> 07:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
ground floor of the barn itself and this
 
07:04:53.990 --> 07:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
cuts into their efficiency and doing the
 
07:04:56.270 --> 07:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
sorting and shipping process so what
 
07:04:58.070 --> 07:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be able to do very much is
 
07:05:00.288 --> 07:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
provide a new seedling cooler facility
 
07:05:02.810 --> 07:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
above four thousand square feet
 
07:05:05.208 --> 07:05:05.218 align:start position:0%
fully insulated with refrigeration
 
07:05:07.788 --> 07:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
equipment that's energy efficient and
 
07:05:09.468 --> 07:05:09.478 align:start position:0%
that I think would put them in very good
 
07:05:11.208 --> 07:05:11.218 align:start position:0%
shape to take advantage of the interest
 
07:05:15.350 --> 07:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the sales and by taking that space
 
07:05:17.868 --> 07:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
cooler space out of the first floor of
 
07:05:19.610 --> 07:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
the barn that would allow us to
 
07:05:21.830 --> 07:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
reconfigure the existing Barn to get a
 
07:05:23.690 --> 07:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
much more efficient sorting and shipping
 
07:05:23.700 --> 07:05:24.890 align:start position:0%
much more efficient sorting and shipping
operation

07:05:24.890 --> 07:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
operation
 
07:05:26.390 --> 07:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
and at the same time the State Fire
 
07:05:27.890 --> 07:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
Marshal has let us know this a few
 
07:05:29.868 --> 07:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
upgrades he'd like us to do
 
07:05:32.570 --> 07:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
including enclosing the fire stairs and
 
07:05:34.968 --> 07:05:34.978 align:start position:0%
taking out the two existing wood stoves
 
07:05:36.708 --> 07:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
that are in and replacing them we
 
07:05:38.930 --> 07:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
propose to replace them with an external
 
07:05:41.868 --> 07:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
wood burning boiler system
 
07:05:44.208 --> 07:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
so those are big concerns from the State
 
07:05:47.510 --> 07:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's point of view
 
07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
other forest and lands facilities across
 
07:05:51.170 --> 07:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
the state that we would like to do work
 
07:05:54.590 --> 07:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
in include Fox Forest in Hillsboro at
 
07:05:56.270 --> 07:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
foxfires we'd like to put some
 
07:05:58.190 --> 07:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
accessible toilets in the Baldwin Center
 
07:06:00.410 --> 07:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
which is a public meeting room we'd like
 
07:06:02.330 --> 07:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
to extend the existing parking lot and
 
07:06:05.090 --> 07:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
pave it so that visitors have a good way
 
07:06:06.590 --> 07:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
to get in and out
 
07:06:08.990 --> 07:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
we need to do also fire rated stair
 
07:06:10.430 --> 07:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
enclosures in the main admin
 
07:06:11.990 --> 07:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
Administrative Building there replace
 
07:06:15.048 --> 07:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
the boiler and there's a tractor garage
 
07:06:17.570 --> 07:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
where the the wood Pier foundations are
 
07:06:19.850 --> 07:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
rotting we just need to get that back
 
07:06:23.030 --> 07:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
into structural shape so it can be used
 
07:06:24.890 --> 07:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
in the urban forestry Center in
 
07:06:24.900 --> 07:06:25.868 align:start position:0%
in the urban forestry Center in
Portsmouth

07:06:25.868 --> 07:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
07:06:28.010 --> 07:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
we want to do work on the two main
 
07:06:30.368 --> 07:06:30.378 align:start position:0%
buildings the main office building
 
07:06:33.110 --> 07:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
needs an accessible entrance to it right
 
07:06:35.090 --> 07:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
now right now people come in the lower
 
07:06:36.830 --> 07:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
level and we have to go down to meet
 
07:06:38.628 --> 07:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
them rather than be able to get them up
 
07:06:40.070 --> 07:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
to our offices
 
07:06:42.110 --> 07:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
in addition the the main stairway in
 
07:06:44.448 --> 07:06:44.458 align:start position:0%
that building needs to be enclosed for
 
07:06:45.890 --> 07:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
fire rating
 
07:06:48.110 --> 07:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the learnings Learning Center which
 
07:06:50.448 --> 07:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
is a big meeting space area used by lots
 
07:06:51.770 --> 07:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
of groups that come in
 
07:06:53.690 --> 07:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
there's some egress improvements that we
 
07:06:56.510 --> 07:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
hope to make and we want to take the
 
07:06:58.610 --> 07:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
existing kitchen which is a setup that
 
07:07:00.350 --> 07:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
no longer gets used and replace it with
 
07:07:03.230 --> 07:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
a setup for caterers which is the method
 
07:07:04.968 --> 07:07:04.978 align:start position:0%
most people use to bring food into these
 
07:07:07.490 --> 07:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
meetings we need new finishes floor wall
 
07:07:10.868 --> 07:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
and ceiling in that building and finally
 
07:07:13.850 --> 07:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
at the urban forestry Center the parking
 
07:07:15.770 --> 07:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
lot uh for a long time we've had a
 
07:07:17.390 --> 07:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
trouble because of the grading around
 
07:07:19.190 --> 07:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
the parking lot we have accessible
 
07:07:20.750 --> 07:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
parking spaces but they're not
 
07:07:22.548 --> 07:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
positioned where they could be most
 
07:07:24.530 --> 07:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
effective we'd like to be able to adjust
 
07:07:26.090 --> 07:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
that so we can get those accessible
 
07:07:29.150 --> 07:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
parking spaces and allow us also to
 
07:07:31.070 --> 07:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
bring in some sight lighting so that
 
07:07:33.170 --> 07:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
evening meetings people can get to their
 
07:07:37.670 --> 07:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
cars after Darkness safely and also pave
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
that parking lot
 
07:07:42.048 --> 07:07:42.058 align:start position:0%
moving on to the North Country Resource
 
07:07:45.230 --> 07:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Center in Lancaster currently we have a
 
07:07:46.968 --> 07:07:46.978 align:start position:0%
contract which we're just about to ask
 
07:07:49.670 --> 07:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be approved to replace the roofs on
 
07:07:52.190 --> 07:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
two of the pole barns but the pole barns
 
07:07:54.288 --> 07:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
also have large areas where the siding
 
07:07:55.968 --> 07:07:55.978 align:start position:0%
is rotted and we'd like to be able to
 
07:07:57.170 --> 07:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
address that
 
07:08:00.170 --> 07:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
one of the pole barns has a bay that's
 
07:08:02.390 --> 07:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
heated in the winter time as a workshop
 
07:08:05.390 --> 07:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
but the insulation is rudimentary so
 
07:08:07.250 --> 07:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
we'd like to insulate that well save
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
some energy costs
 
07:08:12.230 --> 07:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we need to enclose the boiler in the
 
07:08:14.510 --> 07:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
office building for fire safety reasons
 
07:08:14.520 --> 07:08:16.010 align:start position:0%
office building for fire safety reasons
also

07:08:16.010 --> 07:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
also
 
07:08:17.868 --> 07:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
and finally at healing forest in
 
07:08:17.878 --> 07:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
and finally at healing forest in
Peterborough

07:08:19.430 --> 07:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
Peterborough
 
07:08:22.670 --> 07:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh we'd like to build a new garage with
 
07:08:24.410 --> 07:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
a workshop for the maintenance that goes
 
07:08:27.230 --> 07:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:29.868 --> 07:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
so that's the second line item uh any
 
07:08:32.030 --> 07:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions on that
 
07:08:34.250 --> 07:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
07:08:37.070 --> 07:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you all right
 
07:08:39.468 --> 07:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
the third uh item in the governor's
 
07:08:41.330 --> 07:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
capital budget request was for Trails
 
07:08:43.910 --> 07:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau equipment this is sort of a two
 
07:08:46.490 --> 07:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
component request the first part of it
 
07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh is a request for funding that would
 
07:08:50.810 --> 07:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
go towards replacing the oldest and most
 
07:08:52.310 --> 07:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
worn out of the state's snowmobile
 
07:08:53.930 --> 07:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
grooming Fleet
 
07:08:55.968 --> 07:08:55.978 align:start position:0%
the groomers to be replaced are over 30
 
07:08:57.288 --> 07:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
years old
 
07:08:59.030 --> 07:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
the new grow Burns will help the trails
 
07:09:00.708 --> 07:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
Bureau respond to the recent surge of
 
07:09:02.930 --> 07:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
interest in snowmobile Recreation
 
07:09:04.490 --> 07:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
and provide the safe and adequate
 
07:09:07.190 --> 07:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
grooming of the state's network of some
 
07:09:09.288 --> 07:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
7 500 miles of trails that they've come
 
07:09:11.150 --> 07:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
to expect
 
07:09:13.610 --> 07:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
now the second component of this would
 
07:09:15.048 --> 07:09:15.058 align:start position:0%
be for funding that would allow the
 
07:09:18.110 --> 07:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
division to purchase equipment for owned
 
07:09:20.570 --> 07:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
forces Trail maintenance projects such
 
07:09:22.730 --> 07:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
as drainage stitching grading and
 
07:09:25.010 --> 07:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
Culvert replacement there's a category
 
07:09:28.250 --> 07:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
of projects which are a size that R2 our
 
07:09:29.810 --> 07:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
crew could handle itself without having
 
07:09:32.150 --> 07:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
to go through the Contracting process we
 
07:09:33.948 --> 07:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
think we could affect a lot of
 
07:09:35.628 --> 07:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
efficiency and cost savings by doing
 
07:09:35.638 --> 07:09:36.410 align:start position:0%
efficiency and cost savings by doing
that

07:09:36.410 --> 07:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:09:38.390 --> 07:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
equipment we would need to be able to do
 
07:09:40.490 --> 07:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
this include excavator tractor dump
 
07:09:47.110 --> 07:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:50.510 --> 07:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
shall we move a question
 
07:09:52.250 --> 07:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I believe represent Mills saw that
 
07:09:54.468 --> 07:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
was just the proposal that you'd asked
 
07:09:56.270 --> 07:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
for five million dollars that was cut to
 
07:09:58.190 --> 07:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
one million dollars
 
07:10:00.230 --> 07:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay however it's
 
07:10:01.788 --> 07:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
important to note that we have received
 
07:10:04.070 --> 07:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
some arpa funding for these groomers and
 
07:10:05.208 --> 07:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
the amount of three million dollars
 
07:10:07.310 --> 07:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful
 
07:10:10.730 --> 07:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
they so my question is
 
07:10:13.010 --> 07:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm in an area far enough North that
 
07:10:14.690 --> 07:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
I see this equipment and the efforts
 
07:10:17.270 --> 07:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
every day of the week and as a business
 
07:10:19.730 --> 07:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
owner in the area very very appreciative
 
07:10:22.548 --> 07:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
of this work that's done uh by
 
07:10:25.990 --> 07:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
yourselves and also by the uh the clubs
 
07:10:29.208 --> 07:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
so this equipment that's 30 years old
 
07:10:31.368 --> 07:10:31.378 align:start position:0%
the groomers and they've been holding
 
07:10:33.170 --> 07:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
that together like I'm sure our old
 
07:10:36.288 --> 07:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
trucks for D.O.T what what will you do
 
07:10:38.750 --> 07:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
if you get these replaced will those
 
07:10:41.750 --> 07:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
will those go to auction or you will
 
07:10:43.490 --> 07:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
hold on to those for parts if you
 
07:10:46.190 --> 07:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
thought through to that point
 
07:10:54.910 --> 07:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:58.010 --> 07:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
we could also do a museum of historic
 
07:11:00.230 --> 07:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
Brewers but I'm not sure we have a ski
 
07:11:03.708 --> 07:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
museum in Conway we could use that the
 
07:11:03.718 --> 07:11:04.430 align:start position:0%
museum in Conway we could use that the
um

07:11:04.430 --> 07:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:07.850 --> 07:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so if you were you're on I fully
 
07:11:10.968 --> 07:11:10.978 align:start position:0%
understand uh the need for excavators uh
 
07:11:14.090 --> 07:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
tractors dump trucks and so forth
 
07:11:14.100 --> 07:11:16.670 align:start position:0%
tractors dump trucks and so forth
um

07:11:16.670 --> 07:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:19.610 --> 07:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
we do we do a lot of our own Bridge
 
07:11:22.030 --> 07:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
repair many times
 
07:11:25.850 --> 07:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
and the people uh drive to Concord every
 
07:11:25.860 --> 07:11:26.690 align:start position:0%
and the people uh drive to Concord every
day

07:11:26.690 --> 07:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
day
 
07:11:29.390 --> 07:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
and they drive to a site and then by two
 
07:11:30.948 --> 07:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
o'clock they're turning around and
 
07:11:33.170 --> 07:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
driving back and very thankful for the
 
07:11:36.830 --> 07:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
work they do where where do you envision
 
07:11:40.190 --> 07:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
this equipment being housed would you
 
07:11:42.850 --> 07:11:42.860 align:start position:0%
move it around through your locations
 
07:11:46.670 --> 07:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
and is this all equipment that you are
 
07:11:51.110 --> 07:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
your personnel would then have use of
 
07:11:53.690 --> 07:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
okay tell me what your plan is here
 
07:11:56.330 --> 07:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
so it would be staged at the trails
 
07:11:59.090 --> 07:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
Bureau shops which are located at White
 
07:12:01.730 --> 07:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
Lake Sunapee
 
07:12:06.350 --> 07:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
and Lancaster okay and to some extent we
 
07:12:07.850 --> 07:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
can move it around but it becomes a lot
 
07:12:09.670 --> 07:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
less efficient when you have to tractor
 
07:12:13.070 --> 07:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
an excavator long distance like that so
 
07:12:14.810 --> 07:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
the goal would be to have sort of a
 
07:12:16.910 --> 07:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
basic set of equipment in each one of
 
07:12:19.128 --> 07:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
those regions where we could work
 
07:12:21.830 --> 07:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
directly out of those shops thank you
 
07:12:21.840 --> 07:12:22.690 align:start position:0%
directly out of those shops thank you
sir

07:12:22.690 --> 07:12:22.700 align:start position:0%
sir
 
07:12:26.810 --> 07:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes I'll start on the end representative
 
07:12:28.730 --> 07:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that
 
07:12:28.740 --> 07:12:30.530 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that
um

07:12:30.530 --> 07:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:33.468 --> 07:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
excavators cost a fortune and sitting
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing nothing dead time doesn't serve a
 
07:12:38.448 --> 07:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
purpose for them have you looked at just
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
trying to get money in your budget be a
 
07:12:42.350 --> 07:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more efficient and
 
07:12:43.788 --> 07:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
particularly when you get three
 
07:12:45.288 --> 07:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
different locations you can have an
 
07:12:47.628 --> 07:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
excavator dropped on site for one day or
 
07:12:50.570 --> 07:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
one week or one month on a quick rental
 
07:12:53.570 --> 07:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
get full use of it for exactly what you
 
07:12:55.490 --> 07:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
need and let somebody else deal with the
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
wait time or set time as opposed to
 
07:12:59.570 --> 07:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
owning it maintaining it garudging it
 
07:13:01.670 --> 07:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
and schlepping it around the state
 
07:13:03.468 --> 07:13:03.478 align:start position:0%
equipment rental is one of the things
 
07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
that we do also do yep that's
 
07:13:08.030 --> 07:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's currently what what we're
 
07:13:09.430 --> 07:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
accustomed to doing
 
07:13:11.448 --> 07:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
we have
 
07:13:11.458 --> 07:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
we have
um

07:13:11.990 --> 07:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:14.868 --> 07:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
we have run into occasion many occasions
 
07:13:16.490 --> 07:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to do fix something
 
07:13:18.788 --> 07:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
quickly because of a storm or a washout
 
07:13:22.850 --> 07:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
and that process has slowed us down to
 
07:13:24.288 --> 07:13:24.298 align:start position:0%
the point where we've had to shut Trails
 
07:13:26.810 --> 07:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
down and we don't meet expectations of
 
07:13:30.048 --> 07:13:30.058 align:start position:0%
of the public so we were we were
 
07:13:32.208 --> 07:13:32.218 align:start position:0%
exploring this as a way where we could
 
07:13:34.010 --> 07:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
handle a lot of the day-to-day
 
07:13:37.788 --> 07:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance ourselves and perhaps you
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
know if we needed a larger project we
 
07:13:43.310 --> 07:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
would we would go back to the rental but
 
07:13:45.770 --> 07:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
the Rental process as it currently
 
07:13:50.810 --> 07:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
stands isn't as Nimble as we would like
 
07:13:50.820 --> 07:13:52.490 align:start position:0%
stands isn't as Nimble as we would like
okay

07:13:52.490 --> 07:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:13:56.208 --> 07:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you all right follow up
 
07:13:58.730 --> 07:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
I think if you talked just a commentary
 
07:14:00.530 --> 07:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
is I think if you talk to somebody you
 
07:14:02.868 --> 07:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
got a backhoe and a dump truck and rent
 
07:14:04.548 --> 07:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
in the excavator when you need it you're
 
07:14:06.948 --> 07:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
going to be fine oh I yeah yeah I agree
 
07:14:08.390 --> 07:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we want to get too far
 
07:14:12.110 --> 07:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:13.730 --> 07:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been told we have to go
 
07:14:16.128 --> 07:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
through a lengthier process not just the
 
07:14:18.170 --> 07:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
people that we know have who have done
 
07:14:19.490 --> 07:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
this in the past and who are ready to go
 
07:14:20.750 --> 07:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
we need to go through an extensive
 
07:14:23.448 --> 07:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
bidding process now and that has been a
 
07:14:25.850 --> 07:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
month two month process that we are
 
07:14:28.850 --> 07:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
beholden to which has held us up in in a
 
07:14:31.850 --> 07:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
couple of specific areas
 
07:14:34.910 --> 07:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I just to address that issue
 
07:14:37.190 --> 07:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming you're talking about many
 
07:14:40.548 --> 07:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
excavators uh tracked tracked loaders
 
07:14:42.170 --> 07:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
and things like that that are very
 
07:14:45.110 --> 07:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
purposeful can be moved quickly and and
 
07:14:48.890 --> 07:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
you know not spending a 250 000 on a
 
07:14:52.548 --> 07:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
large machine uh represent Kaczynski
 
07:14:54.410 --> 07:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:14:54.420 --> 07:14:55.548 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
question

07:14:55.548 --> 07:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:14:58.190 --> 07:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
um on these groomers how many are you
 
07:15:01.250 --> 07:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
looking to replace and what is the cost
 
07:15:03.650 --> 07:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
per unit for those
 
07:15:06.830 --> 07:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
so uh we were hoping to replace 15
 
07:15:09.650 --> 07:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
groomers and we're looking at cost
 
07:15:10.850 --> 07:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
estimates that are coming in pretty
 
07:15:13.390 --> 07:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
close to 350 000 when you add the
 
07:15:15.948 --> 07:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
attachment that they need for the
 
07:15:17.570 --> 07:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
various types of operations that they're
 
07:15:17.580 --> 07:15:19.070 align:start position:0%
various types of operations that they're
doing

07:15:19.070 --> 07:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
doing
 
07:15:22.670 --> 07:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
and this winter season has provided us
 
07:15:25.368 --> 07:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to test out various
 
07:15:28.730 --> 07:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
equipment from various companies so we
 
07:15:30.890 --> 07:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
use the snow that we've that we've
 
07:15:32.810 --> 07:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
received this winter to to really have
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
our staff using the equipment to know
 
07:15:38.030 --> 07:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
what we're getting into and and to know
 
07:15:39.590 --> 07:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be a perfect match for our
 
07:15:39.600 --> 07:15:40.670 align:start position:0%
that it would be a perfect match for our
work

07:15:40.670 --> 07:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:15:43.070 --> 07:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
07:15:45.890 --> 07:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes a quick question thank you going
 
07:15:49.368 --> 07:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
back to some of the roofing and the
 
07:15:49.378 --> 07:15:50.930 align:start position:0%
back to some of the roofing and the
facilities

07:15:50.930 --> 07:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
07:15:53.208 --> 07:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
have you looked into doing some um
 
07:15:55.190 --> 07:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
quotable takes on the roofs while you're
 
07:15:57.170 --> 07:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
replacing the roofs of these uh
 
07:16:00.890 --> 07:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
particular shelters or uh buildings out
 
07:16:02.330 --> 07:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
07:16:05.690 --> 07:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
yes okay and we've been working with
 
07:16:08.930 --> 07:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
energy grants uh we put in solar panels
 
07:16:11.868 --> 07:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
on the Seco Science Center at Odeon it's
 
07:16:13.310 --> 07:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
been quite effective and of course being
 
07:16:15.110 --> 07:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast Science Center it's a
 
07:16:17.270 --> 07:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
demonstration project as well so it
 
07:16:20.448 --> 07:16:20.458 align:start position:0%
becomes an exhibit that goes on but yes
 
07:16:22.850 --> 07:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh photovoltaic are very interesting to
 
07:16:24.590 --> 07:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
us because we have a lot of remote
 
07:16:26.390 --> 07:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
locations like the Deer Mountain
 
07:16:28.968 --> 07:16:28.978 align:start position:0%
Campground and Pillsbury so we don't
 
07:16:32.270 --> 07:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
have uh grid power too and now suddenly
 
07:16:34.490 --> 07:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
we have an option for ways that we can
 
07:16:36.708 --> 07:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
power water pumps and things like that
 
07:16:40.368 --> 07:16:40.378 align:start position:0%
that isn't a gasoline generator all
 
07:16:45.048 --> 07:16:45.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:46.730 --> 07:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
um I'll go represent Newton and come
 
07:16:48.590 --> 07:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
back to you representative thank you and
 
07:16:50.390 --> 07:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
 
07:16:52.510 --> 07:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
there other kinds of dedicated funds
 
07:16:56.150 --> 07:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that go towards things like Trail Bureau
 
07:16:58.548 --> 07:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
equipment and management do you get
 
07:17:00.850 --> 07:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
other monies coming in because I know
 
07:17:03.230 --> 07:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
you can get a discount I don't have a
 
07:17:04.788 --> 07:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
snowmobile but I understand you can get
 
07:17:06.650 --> 07:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
a discount when you register them if you
 
07:17:09.650 --> 07:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
join a club which does grooming and
 
07:17:11.990 --> 07:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
trails and stuff so do you guys I just
 
07:17:14.510 --> 07:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
see the general is where you're trying
 
07:17:16.310 --> 07:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
to get the money but do you have access
 
07:17:17.510 --> 07:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
to other
 
07:17:24.650 --> 07:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:26.448 --> 07:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
Brian Wilson does
 
07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
and or Chris Marino who who are here
 
07:17:30.830 --> 07:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
um the groomers that we're talking about
 
07:17:32.690 --> 07:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
purchasing in our Fleet of groomers that
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
we currently have we don't just use
 
07:17:36.890 --> 07:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
those on staff those are the groomers
 
07:17:39.170 --> 07:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we also lend out to the clubs to
 
07:17:42.410 --> 07:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
use so it's an it's like a library loan
 
07:17:44.690 --> 07:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
um for groomers um so the groomers that
 
07:17:46.310 --> 07:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking to purchase would also be
 
07:17:48.830 --> 07:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
accessible to a lot of the club use that
 
07:17:52.010 --> 07:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
you referred to and then of course you
 
07:17:54.410 --> 07:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
know when you register your snowmobile
 
07:17:56.570 --> 07:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
or your ATV that registration goes to
 
07:17:58.610 --> 07:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
fish and game and then they allocate a
 
07:18:00.650 --> 07:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
certain percent to us and we take that
 
07:18:03.070 --> 07:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
money most of it to
 
07:18:05.570 --> 07:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
disseminate grants to the local clubs so
 
07:18:08.330 --> 07:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
that they can hire volunteers or
 
07:18:10.368 --> 07:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
part-time staff to do some of the actual
 
07:18:12.048 --> 07:18:12.058 align:start position:0%
maintenance work that we're talking
 
07:18:13.730 --> 07:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
about we only have a staff of about
 
07:18:15.948 --> 07:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
seven in our Trails Bureau so there's no
 
07:18:18.468 --> 07:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
way we could cover it all ourselves
 
07:18:22.490 --> 07:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:24.350 --> 07:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
07:18:25.968 --> 07:18:25.978 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
07:18:28.490 --> 07:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
well anyway there's a million dollars
 
07:18:30.590 --> 07:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
how much are you looking to spend on
 
07:18:32.868 --> 07:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
this excavation equipment looks like
 
07:18:35.030 --> 07:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're opening up an excavation company
 
07:18:35.040 --> 07:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
you're opening up an excavation company
here

07:18:35.990 --> 07:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:18:40.490 --> 07:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say how much is for that
 
07:18:43.128 --> 07:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
no and the situation is that we have uh
 
07:18:45.770 --> 07:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
as I had mentioned before some arpa
 
07:18:49.670 --> 07:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan funds for uh
 
07:18:51.650 --> 07:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
groomers and as I said we are hoping to
 
07:18:54.288 --> 07:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
get in the range of about 15. I
 
07:18:56.030 --> 07:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
understand that our complete Fleet of
 
07:18:58.430 --> 07:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
groomers is numbers something like 259
 
07:19:01.430 --> 07:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
that are being used by clubs all across
 
07:19:02.448 --> 07:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
the state
 
07:19:05.930 --> 07:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
so uh the thought was that
 
07:19:08.390 --> 07:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
with with a three million that we got
 
07:19:09.890 --> 07:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
out of the 5 million that we asked for
 
07:19:12.230 --> 07:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
we were going to be able to get close to
 
07:19:14.690 --> 07:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
the number of groomers we wanted this
 
07:19:16.128 --> 07:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
money would give us a little flexibility
 
07:19:16.138 --> 07:19:17.810 align:start position:0%
money would give us a little flexibility
to

07:19:17.810 --> 07:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:19:20.090 --> 07:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
maybe buy out that Fleet and leave us
 
07:19:22.250 --> 07:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
something in the range of half a million
 
07:19:24.468 --> 07:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
dollars to put towards equipment for our
 
07:19:26.810 --> 07:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
our own staff
 
07:19:29.270 --> 07:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
one more yes follow-up well I'd like to
 
07:19:32.090 --> 07:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Eden I mean
 
07:19:34.788 --> 07:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
I own a company I don't want to own any
 
07:19:36.288 --> 07:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
more equipment and I don't want to hire
 
07:19:39.468 --> 07:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
any more employees it's a Contracting is
 
07:19:41.810 --> 07:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
the way to go especially on things that
 
07:19:43.968 --> 07:19:43.978 align:start position:0%
you don't do every day it's it just
 
07:19:43.978 --> 07:19:45.230 align:start position:0%
you don't do every day it's it just
doesn't

07:19:45.230 --> 07:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
07:19:47.570 --> 07:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense to me thank
 
07:19:47.580 --> 07:19:48.548 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense to me thank
you

07:19:48.548 --> 07:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:19:51.350 --> 07:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could provide a listing of
 
07:19:53.150 --> 07:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
equipment that you're looking to be in
 
07:19:55.610 --> 07:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
will do that do that another time and
 
07:19:57.948 --> 07:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
then take a look at it I will say being
 
07:20:00.770 --> 07:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
involved in the Contracting end of
 
07:20:04.010 --> 07:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's extremely hard number one for
 
07:20:06.110 --> 07:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
them to find a contractor that can work
 
07:20:07.330 --> 07:20:07.340 align:start position:0%
with them
 
07:20:11.810 --> 07:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
and the there are many times if I need a
 
07:20:14.510 --> 07:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
specialty piece of equipment that I
 
07:20:16.128 --> 07:20:16.138 align:start position:0%
don't already own it can be very
 
07:20:18.110 --> 07:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
difficult and time consuming to get that
 
07:20:20.868 --> 07:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
so I understand that so I think if we
 
07:20:23.150 --> 07:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
could get that listing of where you're
 
07:20:26.330 --> 07:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
looking to be and what that ARP is going
 
07:20:28.010 --> 07:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
to do I think that'd be helpful for the
 
07:20:30.048 --> 07:20:30.058 align:start position:0%
uh for the members of the committee
 
07:20:35.150 --> 07:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:38.750 --> 07:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
please continue moving on to the uh
 
07:20:41.390 --> 07:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
fourth line item of the governor's
 
07:20:43.730 --> 07:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
this is for Mount Washington Summit
 
07:20:48.708 --> 07:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and ecology study
 
07:20:50.448 --> 07:20:50.458 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington commission has just
 
07:20:52.250 --> 07:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
completed a master planning effort
 
07:20:54.708 --> 07:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
focused on how to assure the sustainable
 
07:20:56.448 --> 07:20:56.458 align:start position:0%
use of the summit of Mount Washington
 
07:20:58.548 --> 07:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
for a number of purposes including
 
07:21:01.610 --> 07:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
number one a principal Scenic asset for
 
07:21:04.430 --> 07:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
the State uh a tourist destination I'm
 
07:21:05.990 --> 07:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of the Cog Railway and the auto
 
07:21:09.410 --> 07:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
Road Alpine ecosystem unique in New
 
07:21:12.288 --> 07:21:12.298 align:start position:0%
England thinking of the Alpine Gardens a
 
07:21:14.990 --> 07:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
communication site with unparalleled
 
07:21:17.750 --> 07:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
line of sight transmission abilities a
 
07:21:19.968 --> 07:21:19.978 align:start position:0%
meteorological Observatory right up in
 
07:21:21.170 --> 07:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
the jet stream
 
07:21:22.910 --> 07:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
an attraction for hiking and other
 
07:21:25.190 --> 07:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and finally as a
 
07:21:26.628 --> 07:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
state park and all the things that go on
 
07:21:28.190 --> 07:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
in the State Park
 
07:21:29.628 --> 07:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington commission
 
07:21:32.090 --> 07:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
concluded that sound decision making on
 
07:21:34.310 --> 07:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
issues involving the sometimes Divergent
 
07:21:35.990 --> 07:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
interests associated with these uses
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be based on a thorough
 
07:21:39.650 --> 07:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
analysis and understanding of this
 
07:21:42.830 --> 07:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
unique site and the factors affecting it
 
07:21:45.288 --> 07:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
so this project would be used to fund
 
07:21:46.548 --> 07:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
the scientific and Engineering
 
07:21:47.868 --> 07:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
assessment of the environmental
 
07:21:49.250 --> 07:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
conditions the infrastructure
 
07:21:51.650 --> 07:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
requirements and the limiting factors at
 
07:21:53.390 --> 07:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
the summit of Mount Washington
 
07:21:55.788 --> 07:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
the goal of the assessment would be to
 
07:21:57.590 --> 07:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide a basis for evaluating future
 
07:22:00.530 --> 07:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
development plans a means to determine a
 
07:22:02.510 --> 07:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
summit carrying capacity
 
07:22:04.368 --> 07:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
and guidelines for ecosystem
 
07:22:06.948 --> 07:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
conservation at what amounts to a very
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:11.280 --> 07:22:14.810 align:start position:0%
 
questions

07:22:14.810 --> 07:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:19.490 --> 07:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
is is this a project that had any chance
 
07:22:21.468 --> 07:22:21.478 align:start position:0%
of arpa funding
 
07:22:25.548 --> 07:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
and secondly is this a project that if
 
07:22:28.910 --> 07:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
is this looking to be over the course of
 
07:22:31.190 --> 07:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
a couple Seasons where Times short and
 
07:22:33.048 --> 07:22:33.058 align:start position:0%
is this a project that we could break in
 
07:22:37.250 --> 07:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:38.270 --> 07:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
07:22:40.128 --> 07:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
um Senator Jeb Bradley was the chair of
 
07:22:42.708 --> 07:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington Master planning
 
07:22:42.718 --> 07:22:44.330 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington Master planning
process

07:22:44.330 --> 07:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:22:46.070 --> 07:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and so I know that he tried to figure
 
07:22:47.990 --> 07:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
out the best funding source for
 
07:22:50.150 --> 07:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
something like this I'm not sure if he
 
07:22:52.250 --> 07:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk to gopher or if he
 
07:22:53.750 --> 07:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
initiated a conversation with gopher
 
07:22:57.368 --> 07:22:57.378 align:start position:0%
about arpa I was not privy to that
 
07:23:02.390 --> 07:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
this this assessment is is this is the
 
07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
master plan it's on our website the
 
07:23:06.170 --> 07:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
assessment is really the major call out
 
07:23:07.930 --> 07:23:07.940 align:start position:0%
of the master plan
 
07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
and in order for decisions to be made
 
07:23:11.040 --> 07:23:12.190 align:start position:0%
and in order for decisions to be made
about

07:23:12.190 --> 07:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:23:14.510 --> 07:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Yankee building which is up there
 
07:23:16.190 --> 07:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
housing all of our really precious
 
07:23:18.110 --> 07:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
communication stuff which we had an
 
07:23:19.910 --> 07:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
assessment done several years ago for 14
 
07:23:21.350 --> 07:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars we could redo that
 
07:23:23.030 --> 07:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
building we don't want to do one-off
 
07:23:24.468 --> 07:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
projects up there we'd really like to
 
07:23:26.890 --> 07:23:26.900 align:start position:0%
get a holistic assessment of
 
07:23:29.868 --> 07:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs to balance the
 
07:23:31.968 --> 07:23:31.978 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and and like Tom
 
07:23:34.610 --> 07:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
said to understand what our capacity is
 
07:23:35.690 --> 07:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
up there because we could just keep
 
07:23:38.628 --> 07:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
adding toilets up there all day long and
 
07:23:40.368 --> 07:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
and welcome everybody up there but right
 
07:23:42.530 --> 07:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
now it's it's it's really
 
07:23:46.010 --> 07:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
um a challenge to to predict and manage
 
07:23:49.730 --> 07:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
crowd sizes as we move forward the hope
 
07:23:52.090 --> 07:23:52.100 align:start position:0%
is we could put a scope of work together
 
07:23:55.490 --> 07:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
to do one contract to get this work done
 
07:23:56.990 --> 07:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
over one season
 
07:23:58.610 --> 07:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh and and then we can move forward
 
07:23:59.990 --> 07:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
because some of the projects are are
 
07:24:03.948 --> 07:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:06.230 --> 07:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
up there is there any is there any so
 
07:24:06.240 --> 07:24:08.150 align:start position:0%
up there is there any is there any so
the

07:24:08.150 --> 07:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:24:11.570 --> 07:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
so the auto road is owned by a separate
 
07:24:11.580 --> 07:24:13.010 align:start position:0%
so the auto road is owned by a separate
company

07:24:13.010 --> 07:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
company
 
07:24:16.190 --> 07:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
Corporation whatever it might be has
 
07:24:19.490 --> 07:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
have you approached them as to whether
 
07:24:21.770 --> 07:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
they might be willing to
 
07:24:24.048 --> 07:24:24.058 align:start position:0%
again throw some funds in there because
 
07:24:25.788 --> 07:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be a benefit for
 
07:24:28.010 --> 07:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
them also so the auto Road The
 
07:24:30.948 --> 07:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
Observatory the Cog railroad all
 
07:24:32.570 --> 07:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
participated in the master planning
 
07:24:35.230 --> 07:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
process which took about a year
 
07:24:37.850 --> 07:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
and at one point there was discussion
 
07:24:37.860 --> 07:24:39.288 align:start position:0%
and at one point there was discussion
about

07:24:39.288 --> 07:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:24:42.830 --> 07:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
how to how to afford such a large
 
07:24:42.840 --> 07:24:44.170 align:start position:0%
how to how to afford such a large
undertaking

07:24:44.170 --> 07:24:44.180 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
07:24:47.868 --> 07:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
and the conclusion that was voted on by
 
07:24:49.490 --> 07:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
the members of the of the commission
 
07:24:49.500 --> 07:24:51.410 align:start position:0%
the members of the of the commission
recommended

07:24:51.410 --> 07:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
07:24:53.208 --> 07:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
they approached the state for the
 
07:24:56.690 --> 07:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
funding for the study
 
07:24:59.510 --> 07:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
could you give us a link so we could see
 
07:25:01.788 --> 07:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
your report please yes right any other
 
07:25:01.798 --> 07:25:04.730 align:start position:0%
your report please yes right any other
questions

07:25:04.730 --> 07:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:06.590 --> 07:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
07:25:08.270 --> 07:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
can I do something that's not directly
 
07:25:09.910 --> 07:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget related
 
07:25:11.990 --> 07:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
well we'll give you we'll give you some
 
07:25:16.968 --> 07:25:16.978 align:start position:0%
rope go ahead okay so at the uh Nursery
 
07:25:19.128 --> 07:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
it's one of the great factors of the
 
07:25:20.448 --> 07:25:20.458 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire government that
 
07:25:22.010 --> 07:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
90 of the people in New Hampshire don't
 
07:25:24.350 --> 07:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
know about we have a tree right behind
 
07:25:26.390 --> 07:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the state house that's a black walnut I
 
07:25:29.750 --> 07:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
believe that was a derivative of a tree
 
07:25:32.390 --> 07:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
obviously George Washington estate
 
07:25:34.968 --> 07:25:34.978 align:start position:0%
and I threatened to put in a bill for
 
07:25:36.890 --> 07:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
many years and then real life happens
 
07:25:39.948 --> 07:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
and it gets put aside to have the
 
07:25:45.048 --> 07:25:45.058 align:start position:0%
nursery make 234 seedlings from that to
 
07:25:46.910 --> 07:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
donate either to every town or every
 
07:25:49.788 --> 07:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
school which would one extend that
 
07:25:51.948 --> 07:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
Heritage but two give you folks some
 
07:25:54.048 --> 07:25:54.058 align:start position:0%
recognition and probably pay back in
 
07:25:55.850 --> 07:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
business but if you don't think it would
 
07:25:57.530 --> 07:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
pay back enough business I'd be happy to
 
07:26:00.410 --> 07:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
put in a bill but
 
07:26:02.868 --> 07:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
just a pondered it it might be a nice
 
07:26:02.878 --> 07:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
just a pondered it it might be a nice
little

07:26:04.310 --> 07:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
little
 
07:26:06.948 --> 07:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
statement from the agency I'm looking at
 
07:26:08.810 --> 07:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
our state Forester Patrick Hackley is
 
07:26:10.190 --> 07:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
here with us I don't know if you have
 
07:26:13.070 --> 07:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
anything you'd like to say sure
 
07:26:13.080 --> 07:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
anything you'd like to say sure
um

07:26:14.390 --> 07:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:16.310 --> 07:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to work with you whether
 
07:26:18.590 --> 07:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's legislation or not we do have a
 
07:26:20.570 --> 07:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
program the New Hampshire Champion tree
 
07:26:23.208 --> 07:26:23.218 align:start position:0%
program and we we're
 
07:26:25.788 --> 07:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
devising a proposal to take seed from
 
07:26:27.948 --> 07:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
all of our largest tree species in the
 
07:26:29.930 --> 07:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
state and propagate them at the nursery
 
07:26:29.940 --> 07:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
state and propagate them at the nursery
so

07:26:31.430 --> 07:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:26:33.350 --> 07:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
your timing is good with that idea there
 
07:26:34.670 --> 07:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
might be an opportunity for us to work
 
07:26:37.548 --> 07:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
with you and our Nursery manager so
 
07:26:40.548 --> 07:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
Washington a state Nursery Heritage is
 
07:26:43.010 --> 07:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
pretty good keep going yeah thanks for
 
07:26:44.090 --> 07:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
07:26:50.330 --> 07:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:53.628 --> 07:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
are there other is is there more to your
 
07:26:56.090 --> 07:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
presentation uh yes I did draw attention
 
07:26:58.730 --> 07:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
to the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters as
 
07:27:00.770 --> 07:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
an example of
 
07:27:04.910 --> 07:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the roads and uh and parking lot
 
07:27:07.730 --> 07:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
bucket of projects that we
 
07:27:10.010 --> 07:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
um that we spoke to you about and so I I
 
07:27:11.570 --> 07:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you have been to
 
07:27:13.910 --> 07:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lake Headwaters lands up
 
07:27:16.128 --> 07:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
north they're beautiful and accessible
 
07:27:20.090 --> 07:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
for Hunting Fishing recreating Trail use
 
07:27:23.990 --> 07:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
um both motorized and non-motorized and
 
07:27:26.570 --> 07:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we're all this agency is
 
07:27:29.150 --> 07:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
obligated to maintain the roads for the
 
07:27:32.270 --> 07:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
public access thank you um and and so we
 
07:27:34.850 --> 07:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
shared a handout to to let you know what
 
07:27:37.190 --> 07:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
that situation looks like right now with
 
07:27:39.830 --> 07:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
your permission could I ask a former
 
07:27:42.350 --> 07:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
speaker and chair of our committee to
 
07:27:44.990 --> 07:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
come forward and perhaps offer us a
 
07:27:47.330 --> 07:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
history of that project and I believe
 
07:27:50.208 --> 07:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
Charles Charlie lebeck is there also I
 
07:27:53.690 --> 07:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
will yield my microphone okay thank you
 
07:27:57.948 --> 07:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:00.110 --> 07:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
for those new members that don't know
 
07:28:02.690 --> 07:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
the gentleman on the right former
 
07:28:05.150 --> 07:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house twice and chairman
 
07:28:08.090 --> 07:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
of our committee for many years Mr
 
07:28:09.770 --> 07:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here
 
07:28:11.810 --> 07:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is Charlie
 
07:28:14.448 --> 07:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
Levesque and this handouts you have he
 
07:28:16.690 --> 07:28:16.700 align:start position:0%
had a lot to do with writing it and he
 
07:28:19.610 --> 07:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
was process started quite a few years
 
07:28:21.170 --> 07:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
ago now it's hard to believe how long
 
07:28:23.930 --> 07:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
ago it was but in my opinion and because
 
07:28:25.968 --> 07:28:25.978 align:start position:0%
I had something to do with it I think it
 
07:28:27.410 --> 07:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
was one of the best things to say in New
 
07:28:28.850 --> 07:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ever did
 
07:28:30.890 --> 07:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
and as I said on the floor of the house
 
07:28:32.628 --> 07:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
when we had the 10 million dollar bill
 
07:28:35.810 --> 07:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
to do the bonding to purchase this land
 
07:28:38.208 --> 07:28:38.218 align:start position:0%
we get one chance and it's going to go
 
07:28:40.850 --> 07:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
by quick so if we don't do it now the
 
07:28:42.708 --> 07:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
state will never own it and I think
 
07:28:44.690 --> 07:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's born to be true by when you see
 
07:28:47.330 --> 07:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
what's happened to other land uh fossils
 
07:28:49.190 --> 07:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
up north
 
07:28:51.708 --> 07:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
um the unique thing about this and
 
07:28:55.430 --> 07:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
Charlie can speak to it too is that this
 
07:28:56.690 --> 07:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
07:28:58.310 --> 07:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
this channel is just reminding me this
 
07:28:59.570 --> 07:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
has never been done anywhere in the
 
07:29:01.610 --> 07:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
country before where the state has
 
07:29:04.850 --> 07:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
bought this uh land given out a
 
07:29:06.468 --> 07:29:06.478 align:start position:0%
conservation holding a conservation
 
07:29:08.990 --> 07:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
easement but the state owns the roads
 
07:29:11.090 --> 07:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I I can only stress that can't
 
07:29:13.910 --> 07:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
stress that enough we the state of New
 
07:29:16.310 --> 07:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually own the roads in that
 
07:29:16.320 --> 07:29:17.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually own the roads in that
uh

07:29:17.530 --> 07:29:17.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:29:21.288 --> 07:29:21.298 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty six thousand acres so
 
07:29:24.350 --> 07:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's our Our obligation and duty to
 
07:29:27.170 --> 07:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
maintain those roads because it's what
 
07:29:28.850 --> 07:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
the public uses to get around in there
 
07:29:30.490 --> 07:29:30.500 align:start position:0%
whether no matter what they're doing
 
07:29:33.410 --> 07:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling the road doesn't make that
 
07:29:35.090 --> 07:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
much of a difference all the time but if
 
07:29:36.590 --> 07:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
you don't keep the mode and keep the
 
07:29:38.090 --> 07:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
brush back and things like that you
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
don't have adequate snowmobile trails so
 
07:29:42.948 --> 07:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
it does affect winter operations too but
 
07:29:45.490 --> 07:29:45.500 align:start position:0%
it affects the timber harvesting
 
07:29:48.170 --> 07:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
we cut quite a bit of Timber on that
 
07:29:51.048 --> 07:29:51.058 align:start position:0%
land which the timber tax goes to the
 
07:29:53.930 --> 07:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
local communities but it provides a lot
 
07:29:56.750 --> 07:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
of jobs up in the area the company that
 
07:29:58.070 --> 07:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
owns this property they actually
 
07:30:01.490 --> 07:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
contribute a certain percentage of their
 
07:30:04.250 --> 07:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
income towards the roads also so it's a
 
07:30:07.128 --> 07:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility but it I can tell
 
07:30:09.170 --> 07:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
you it's just so successful
 
07:30:11.628 --> 07:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
and so important to the North Country
 
07:30:13.610 --> 07:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
especially but also for the whole state
 
07:30:15.708 --> 07:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I can't I don't know
 
07:30:17.330 --> 07:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
that they have the figures on the
 
07:30:19.670 --> 07:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobile use up on that land but
 
07:30:22.310 --> 07:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's a Statewide issue and I mean it's
 
07:30:24.708 --> 07:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's huge the people at snowmobile there
 
07:30:28.070 --> 07:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
hiking fishing fishing licenses hunting
 
07:30:30.650 --> 07:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
licenses goes on and on and on the
 
07:30:32.208 --> 07:30:32.218 align:start position:0%
people from all over the state in New
 
07:30:34.368 --> 07:30:34.378 align:start position:0%
England and the country that use this
 
07:30:38.330 --> 07:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
property and it's unfortunately it's uh
 
07:30:40.968 --> 07:30:40.978 align:start position:0%
just happened that the endowments that
 
07:30:43.070 --> 07:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
were set up to do this just aren't
 
07:30:45.110 --> 07:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking care of the roads the cost of
 
07:30:48.288 --> 07:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
doing this is has exceeded what we have
 
07:30:51.468 --> 07:30:51.478 align:start position:0%
available the department did go we and
 
07:30:53.510 --> 07:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes uh Headwaters
 
07:30:55.490 --> 07:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
Committee of which I'm a member as well
 
07:30:56.930 --> 07:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
as Charlie and I have a list of the
 
07:30:58.610 --> 07:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
people if you'd like to see it who are
 
07:31:01.250 --> 07:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
on it it's a advisory committee but it's
 
07:31:02.868 --> 07:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
made up of a number of people most of
 
07:31:04.490 --> 07:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
whom are from the North country but not
 
07:31:09.590 --> 07:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
all and we advocate for doing what we
 
07:31:11.030 --> 07:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to do up there to keep the place
 
07:31:11.040 --> 07:31:12.048 align:start position:0%
have to do up there to keep the place
going

07:31:12.048 --> 07:31:12.058 align:start position:0%
going
 
07:31:14.090 --> 07:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
I will say that one thing this committee
 
07:31:15.948 --> 07:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
could do and speaking of leasing so I'm
 
07:31:19.250 --> 07:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
well I was off track a little bit but
 
07:31:21.530 --> 07:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a problem we we I say we the
 
07:31:22.788 --> 07:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes
 
07:31:26.510 --> 07:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh folks wanted to buy a tractor and
 
07:31:29.330 --> 07:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually they tried to lease one
 
07:31:32.990 --> 07:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a nightmare and I I there's a
 
07:31:34.788 --> 07:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
challenge CR committee to go through
 
07:31:36.590 --> 07:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
this process and work with not only this
 
07:31:38.628 --> 07:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
all departments facing the same issue
 
07:31:40.548 --> 07:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
it's just a nightmare to try to lease
 
07:31:43.490 --> 07:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
anything it takes months and it's it's a
 
07:31:45.170 --> 07:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
real problem and it's something you
 
07:31:46.788 --> 07:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
might want to look into if I know you
 
07:31:49.128 --> 07:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
have enough to do but you could really
 
07:31:51.048 --> 07:31:51.058 align:start position:0%
solve a lot of problems if you did that
 
07:31:52.610 --> 07:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
but anyway that's my little side note
 
07:31:55.610 --> 07:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
but Charlie do you have something
 
07:31:57.350 --> 07:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much thank you Mr
 
07:31:59.270 --> 07:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee why am
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
I here uh back when uh this was all
 
07:32:05.030 --> 07:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
discussed before the legislature and and
 
07:32:07.010 --> 07:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
the deal was put together I was
 
07:32:09.468 --> 07:32:09.478 align:start position:0%
consultant uh working for the non-profit
 
07:32:11.930 --> 07:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
that spearheaded the whole effort the
 
07:32:14.690 --> 07:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
trust for public land and so this land
 
07:32:17.628 --> 07:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
was Paper Company land remember we we've
 
07:32:19.730 --> 07:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
had several PayPal companies own
 
07:32:21.530 --> 07:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of acres in the
 
07:32:24.708 --> 07:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
North Country this was the land that way
 
07:32:27.170 --> 07:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
back when was Saint Regis and Champion
 
07:32:29.270 --> 07:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
International and then International
 
07:32:32.390 --> 07:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
Paper uh before the land was secured by
 
07:32:34.070 --> 07:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
the trust Republic land so that this
 
07:32:37.610 --> 07:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
public process could happen and as uh Mr
 
07:32:40.930 --> 07:32:40.940 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh said uh very unique because
 
07:32:46.010 --> 07:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
the land of the original 171 500 Acres
 
07:32:46.020 --> 07:32:47.690 align:start position:0%
the land of the original 171 500 Acres
146

07:32:47.690 --> 07:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
146
 
07:32:51.110 --> 07:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
000 and acres and change is owned by a
 
07:32:53.868 --> 07:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
private landowner still paying taxes
 
07:32:56.750 --> 07:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
still cutting the timber uh but the
 
07:32:58.910 --> 07:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
unique part about it as he said because
 
07:33:00.708 --> 07:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
these kinds of projects with this kind
 
07:33:02.270 --> 07:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
of acreage have been done elsewhere
 
07:33:05.330 --> 07:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
particularly in Maine but uh in all
 
07:33:07.548 --> 07:33:07.558 align:start position:0%
those cases the private landowner ends
 
07:33:10.430 --> 07:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
up owning all the roads and it was uh
 
07:33:12.948 --> 07:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
really uh far-reaching thinking to have
 
07:33:14.868 --> 07:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
the state on the main roads there
 
07:33:17.270 --> 07:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
because it gives the members of the
 
07:33:19.490 --> 07:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
public complete access to that property
 
07:33:21.110 --> 07:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
and without that not that we wouldn't
 
07:33:22.730 --> 07:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
have access to it but not in the way
 
07:33:26.510 --> 07:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we we uh we have it now and so the
 
07:33:29.330 --> 07:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
the important part of recreational
 
07:33:31.490 --> 07:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
access happens to be
 
07:33:34.030 --> 07:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
these gravel roads which amount to about
 
07:33:37.850 --> 07:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
270 miles on the property uh the private
 
07:33:40.368 --> 07:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
company owns another couple hundred uh
 
07:33:43.190 --> 07:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
miles of roads that they maintain mostly
 
07:33:45.948 --> 07:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
for harvesting purposes and so for the
 
07:33:47.930 --> 07:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
public to get on to hunt fish and do all
 
07:33:49.850 --> 07:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
the things that they do generate all the
 
07:33:53.570 --> 07:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
license income and really are critical
 
07:33:55.910 --> 07:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the economies of the three towns
 
07:33:58.128 --> 07:33:58.138 align:start position:0%
involved Pittsburgh Clarksville and
 
07:34:00.350 --> 07:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
Stewartstown they need access to the
 
07:34:02.030 --> 07:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
property they do that on the road system
 
07:34:05.628 --> 07:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
and back when we did this project did
 
07:34:07.610 --> 07:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
something else that was unique which the
 
07:34:09.708 --> 07:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
which was to raise three million dollars
 
07:34:12.230 --> 07:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
of extra money private money that were
 
07:34:14.868 --> 07:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
put in endowments that went towards
 
07:34:16.730 --> 07:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
these some of these activities but as
 
07:34:20.030 --> 07:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker said we just don't have
 
07:34:21.890 --> 07:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
enough in those endowments it's helped
 
07:34:23.330 --> 07:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
and there's been some maintenance going
 
07:34:26.510 --> 07:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
on and and I can say that since this was
 
07:34:29.570 --> 07:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
set up in 2001 no one has ever been
 
07:34:32.270 --> 07:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
before you saying could there be some
 
07:34:34.010 --> 07:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
additional money for the road system and
 
07:34:35.510 --> 07:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the capital budget hasn't happened to
 
07:34:37.310 --> 07:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
date not that it's never going to happen
 
07:34:40.730 --> 07:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
again but I think the intent is that we
 
07:34:43.548 --> 07:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coming before you uh every
 
07:34:45.410 --> 07:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
every single capital budget every two
 
07:34:47.570 --> 07:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
year period but it might happen again 10
 
07:34:49.850 --> 07:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
years from now we just the money that's
 
07:34:51.288 --> 07:34:51.298 align:start position:0%
been available has just been not been
 
07:34:53.330 --> 07:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
enough and the road system's so critical
 
07:34:55.910 --> 07:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
so hopefully you'll be able to find some
 
07:34:57.590 --> 07:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
room in the capital budget to include
 
07:34:59.628 --> 07:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
something at the at the Connecticut
 
07:35:02.208 --> 07:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
Lakes Headwaters uh task force the
 
07:35:04.850 --> 07:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
committee that set up statutorial that
 
07:35:07.788 --> 07:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
speaker and I sit on we we talked about
 
07:35:10.968 --> 07:35:10.978 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars as part of the
 
07:35:12.708 --> 07:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
capital budget to make up that that
 
07:35:14.570 --> 07:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
shortfall that hasn't been there to keep
 
07:35:16.310 --> 07:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
those roads in order I've spoken too
 
07:35:18.708 --> 07:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
long probably but I was there from the
 
07:35:19.730 --> 07:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
beginning and I thank you for the
 
07:35:21.770 --> 07:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about this year and
 
07:35:23.330 --> 07:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll consider just 30
 
07:35:25.250 --> 07:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
seconds please the key thing that I
 
07:35:26.990 --> 07:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
didn't mention about this whole project
 
07:35:29.750 --> 07:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
when we started was and why we got the
 
07:35:32.090 --> 07:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the blessing of the people up
 
07:35:33.890 --> 07:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
north especially but even throughout New
 
07:35:36.590 --> 07:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they use that Land We insisted
 
07:35:38.830 --> 07:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
I say we those of us involved with it
 
07:35:41.990 --> 07:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
insisted that the traditional uses would
 
07:35:44.270 --> 07:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
be maintained this property was going to
 
07:35:46.730 --> 07:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
be left the way it had been used for
 
07:35:48.650 --> 07:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
everything that had been used Hunting
 
07:35:51.468 --> 07:35:51.478 align:start position:0%
Fishing snow reeling whatever and that
 
07:35:54.110 --> 07:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
to this day that is still the case so
 
07:35:56.868 --> 07:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing if I could missile
 
07:35:56.878 --> 07:35:57.968 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing if I could missile
vacuum

07:35:57.968 --> 07:35:57.978 align:start position:0%
vacuum
 
07:36:02.170 --> 07:36:02.180 align:start position:0%
what or what year did the state
 
07:36:05.270 --> 07:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
purchases land yeah remember that the
 
07:36:08.990 --> 07:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
the way that it uh turned out 171 500
 
07:36:10.670 --> 07:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
Acres was owned by International Paper
 
07:36:10.680 --> 07:36:12.288 align:start position:0%
Acres was owned by International Paper
25

07:36:12.288 --> 07:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
25
 
07:36:15.170 --> 07:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
000 Acres of that was purchased in fee
 
07:36:17.390 --> 07:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
by the state and is for the most part
 
07:36:19.910 --> 07:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
through Fish and Game management now 100
 
07:36:22.910 --> 07:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
acres actually went to Natural now
 
07:36:26.090 --> 07:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources and the
 
07:36:29.030 --> 07:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
rest was purchased by a private
 
07:36:29.040 --> 07:36:30.368 align:start position:0%
rest was purchased by a private
landowner

07:36:30.368 --> 07:36:30.378 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
07:36:33.830 --> 07:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
2001 but at the time the state purchased
 
07:36:35.868 --> 07:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
a conservation easement on that private
 
07:36:40.070 --> 07:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
land that 146 000 acres and and change
 
07:36:41.990 --> 07:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that means that the current
 
07:36:44.750 --> 07:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
landowner can manage it for Timber but
 
07:36:47.390 --> 07:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
really nothing else cannot develop it uh
 
07:36:49.070 --> 07:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
can certainly sell it in fact this is
 
07:36:50.990 --> 07:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the third private landowner that's owned
 
07:36:54.048 --> 07:36:54.058 align:start position:0%
this land since 2001 and yet nothing has
 
07:36:56.090 --> 07:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
changed so the construct of a private
 
07:36:58.850 --> 07:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
ownership with a conservation easement
 
07:37:00.948 --> 07:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
that assures that it's not developed and
 
07:37:03.350 --> 07:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's available for these uses works
 
07:37:05.390 --> 07:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
because we're on the third private owner
 
07:37:07.250 --> 07:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I hope hopefully that deal was it
 
07:37:09.530 --> 07:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
2001 when it came before the legislature
 
07:37:11.868 --> 07:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
that was my question yes yes it was Mr
 
07:37:11.878 --> 07:37:13.610 align:start position:0%
that was my question yes yes it was Mr
so

07:37:13.610 --> 07:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:37:16.810 --> 07:37:16.820 align:start position:0%
um so we the state managed by
 
07:37:19.990 --> 07:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
we own the roads now
 
07:37:24.708 --> 07:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
and so that gives access for the for our
 
07:37:28.250 --> 07:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
residents to get in out of there so
 
07:37:32.208 --> 07:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
are are the movement of the residents
 
07:37:35.330 --> 07:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
only in or near or they have access
 
07:37:37.250 --> 07:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
through the property for fishing and
 
07:37:39.530 --> 07:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
hunting and how how much of the year is
 
07:37:41.570 --> 07:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
that blocked off for Timber operations
 
07:37:44.270 --> 07:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
or is it just simply posted and you work
 
07:37:46.850 --> 07:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
around it yeah I mean it's a working for
 
07:37:49.128 --> 07:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
us so there are some times but uh
 
07:37:51.410 --> 07:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
usually the roads are not closed because
 
07:37:53.208 --> 07:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
of Timber harvesting there are signs put
 
07:37:56.150 --> 07:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
up uh in the winter time that not all
 
07:37:57.708 --> 07:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
the roads are accessible simply because
 
07:37:59.570 --> 07:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the condition whether they've been
 
07:38:01.788 --> 07:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
plowed or not but those roads are used
 
07:38:03.770 --> 07:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
for snowmobiling as well during the
 
07:38:06.110 --> 07:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
winter time so yeah I mean these roads
 
07:38:08.570 --> 07:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
are available to to Residents one way or
 
07:38:10.670 --> 07:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
another pretty much year round thank you
 
07:38:12.350 --> 07:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
I was completely unaware other other
 
07:38:16.548 --> 07:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:19.250 --> 07:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes please Roxanne thank you Mr chairman
 
07:38:21.708 --> 07:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
07:38:23.628 --> 07:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
um kind of familiar with that area but
 
07:38:25.730 --> 07:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering the roads that New
 
07:38:27.310 --> 07:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has and you're talking about
 
07:38:31.010 --> 07:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
how important are they to immigration to
 
07:38:33.650 --> 07:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
be able to travel those roads to get
 
07:38:36.110 --> 07:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
closer to where illegals might be coming
 
07:38:39.410 --> 07:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
in I understand it's just recently it's
 
07:38:41.390 --> 07:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
becoming more of a focus with the
 
07:38:43.610 --> 07:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
governor and is there any money
 
07:38:46.610 --> 07:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
available for that does it in other
 
07:38:48.110 --> 07:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
words with those roads that we've got
 
07:38:50.510 --> 07:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
does it get the immigration people
 
07:38:53.150 --> 07:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
closer to where people might be coming
 
07:38:54.948 --> 07:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
across the border
 
07:38:57.350 --> 07:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
well it's really not that close to the
 
07:38:59.030 --> 07:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
Border okay I suppose if you get up to
 
07:39:00.530 --> 07:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
boundary pond
 
07:39:02.030 --> 07:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
but they're going to get lost if they
 
07:39:04.730 --> 07:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
get up there anyway but yeah it's not I
 
07:39:07.490 --> 07:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as a as an issue
 
07:39:09.170 --> 07:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably not saying the immigration
 
07:39:11.628 --> 07:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue but I don't think it's as
 
07:39:13.310 --> 07:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
it pertains to this property would be
 
07:39:14.810 --> 07:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know how far from the
 
07:39:16.730 --> 07:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
border we are it goes pretty close in
 
07:39:18.830 --> 07:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
some areas so do you think they use
 
07:39:21.650 --> 07:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
those roads immigration
 
07:39:24.230 --> 07:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
the border patrol I mean I've seen the
 
07:39:25.850 --> 07:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
border patrol out there before oh yeah
 
07:39:29.030 --> 07:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay they go there yes so reminder there
 
07:39:33.590 --> 07:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
is a you know a legal uh Crossing at the
 
07:39:35.270 --> 07:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
tip of Pittsburgh
 
07:39:38.270 --> 07:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and border patrol does in fact
 
07:39:41.090 --> 07:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
um they patrol all of the the roads that
 
07:39:42.650 --> 07:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
are associated with it there there are a
 
07:39:45.350 --> 07:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
few places where the roads end up within
 
07:39:48.048 --> 07:39:48.058 align:start position:0%
a mile or so of the Canadian border but
 
07:39:49.730 --> 07:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
there are no roads that cross over
 
07:39:52.070 --> 07:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
outside of that official border crossing
 
07:39:54.410 --> 07:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the northern part of Pittsburgh these
 
07:39:56.510 --> 07:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
gravel roads don't cross uh anywhere
 
07:39:58.968 --> 07:39:58.978 align:start position:0%
near uh the actual border uh with Canada
 
07:40:01.810 --> 07:40:01.820 align:start position:0%
one more yeah just the statement uh we
 
07:40:04.310 --> 07:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've run into border patrol on Indian
 
07:40:06.650 --> 07:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
Stream Road before that's why I wonder
 
07:40:08.868 --> 07:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
if it's important to keep these roads
 
07:40:08.878 --> 07:40:09.948 align:start position:0%
if it's important to keep these roads
open

07:40:09.948 --> 07:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
open
 
07:40:12.770 --> 07:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
for them in addition to the Taurus and
 
07:40:14.510 --> 07:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
what have you they're open all the time
 
07:40:14.520 --> 07:40:16.430 align:start position:0%
what have you they're open all the time
I

07:40:16.430 --> 07:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:40:18.110 --> 07:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
once in a while a logging operation
 
07:40:20.090 --> 07:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
might close one of the roads at the
 
07:40:22.968 --> 07:40:22.978 align:start position:0%
timber company is in charge of perhaps
 
07:40:25.010 --> 07:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
but all the main roads going through
 
07:40:27.410 --> 07:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
I've never seen one close I I think
 
07:40:29.390 --> 07:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative might be alluding
 
07:40:31.670 --> 07:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe border patrol should also be
 
07:40:34.610 --> 07:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
contributing to your road fund I think
 
07:40:36.468 --> 07:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
that is the point so we could try that
 
07:40:38.468 --> 07:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that to the commissioner okay
 
07:40:42.590 --> 07:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
07:40:45.468 --> 07:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
represent Mills uh thank you Mr chair I
 
07:40:47.628 --> 07:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put some kind of a dollar
 
07:40:50.448 --> 07:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
fix on this uh I've heard a couple of
 
07:40:52.788 --> 07:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
figures tossed around
 
07:40:54.890 --> 07:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
um anything in particular that we're
 
07:40:57.410 --> 07:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
looking for a half million a million
 
07:41:00.288 --> 07:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
million five do we have any set figure
 
07:41:02.570 --> 07:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
because I do understand this is like a
 
07:41:05.330 --> 07:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
this is not a yearly ask this is like
 
07:41:07.010 --> 07:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
one time and this is going to be every
 
07:41:09.410 --> 07:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 years you have to come back and
 
07:41:09.420 --> 07:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 years you have to come back and
ask

07:41:13.430 --> 07:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:17.510 --> 07:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes um so in the um
 
07:41:19.368 --> 07:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
and sort of the the
 
07:41:22.128 --> 07:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
bucket the title of the projects would
 
07:41:25.548 --> 07:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
be for roads and and parking lots um and
 
07:41:28.368 --> 07:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
the subcategory would be
 
07:41:30.770 --> 07:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
Connecticut lakes and I believe the the
 
07:41:32.930 --> 07:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
07:41:38.330 --> 07:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
um have earmarked uh 1.5 million as a an
 
07:41:40.910 --> 07:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
S A best estimate for immediate
 
07:41:43.250 --> 07:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
needs that they could tackle
 
07:41:45.770 --> 07:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
and so the remainder between 1.5 and
 
07:41:48.890 --> 07:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
1.75 75 would be to support some of the
 
07:41:50.270 --> 07:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
parking lots that I alluded to at other
 
07:41:53.810 --> 07:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
state parks okay thank you thank you any
 
07:41:55.548 --> 07:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
07:41:58.690 --> 07:41:58.700 align:start position:0%
yes please represent bogert
 
07:42:02.930 --> 07:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh this road weights are these like some
 
07:42:05.030 --> 07:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the roads that are uh going in
 
07:42:07.310 --> 07:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
between first Connecticut and second
 
07:42:10.368 --> 07:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lake bike fire tower I think
 
07:42:12.850 --> 07:42:12.860 align:start position:0%
one of them was like a Fire Tower Road
 
07:42:15.890 --> 07:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
where you just go out in the middle of
 
07:42:18.410 --> 07:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
nowhere and and that's about it and
 
07:42:20.890 --> 07:42:20.900 align:start position:0%
about the cross signs or just GPS
 
07:42:25.368 --> 07:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
coordinates and stuff is is okay yep
 
07:42:28.368 --> 07:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's that's right and we also we also
 
07:42:31.250 --> 07:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
let that uh set up for moose hunting for
 
07:42:33.048 --> 07:42:33.058 align:start position:0%
the moose hunting lottery and stuff like
 
07:42:35.750 --> 07:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
that so people can access through there
 
07:42:39.170 --> 07:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
also okay yeah almost like there was any
 
07:42:40.788 --> 07:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
number of you know you've got boundary
 
07:42:44.270 --> 07:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
Pond and first Inlet and all kinds of
 
07:42:47.030 --> 07:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
places the people kayak and it was a
 
07:42:49.310 --> 07:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
myriad of things bird watching is one of
 
07:42:51.110 --> 07:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
the more popular things actually up
 
07:42:52.788 --> 07:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
there that people come up to do because
 
07:42:55.190 --> 07:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
they get birds that come down from
 
07:42:56.930 --> 07:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
Canada and this and that I'm not a bird
 
07:43:00.650 --> 07:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
watcher but you it's a beautiful ride
 
07:43:02.990 --> 07:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
down I've done that with my family down
 
07:43:04.730 --> 07:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
some of those roads not knowing where
 
07:43:07.070 --> 07:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're going but it was a nice ride
 
07:43:09.770 --> 07:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah that's good
 
07:43:09.780 --> 07:43:11.048 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah that's good
that's good

07:43:11.048 --> 07:43:11.058 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
07:43:13.850 --> 07:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
07:43:16.490 --> 07:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Jack uh thank
 
07:43:17.868 --> 07:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you it's good to
 
07:43:19.490 --> 07:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
see everyone again uh are you
 
07:43:22.010 --> 07:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
anticipating you would advertise this in
 
07:43:24.110 --> 07:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
one Fell Swoop and get it all done in
 
07:43:28.670 --> 07:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:31.548 --> 07:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm turning to um Brian Wilson
 
07:43:34.368 --> 07:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
and Patrick Hackley who are behind me
 
07:43:35.810 --> 07:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I think we would probably break it up
 
07:43:39.230 --> 07:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
into projects correct yeah
 
07:43:41.330 --> 07:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
typically we've been able to
 
07:43:41.340 --> 07:43:41.930 align:start position:0%
typically we've been able to
um

07:43:41.930 --> 07:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:45.770 --> 07:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
through a a given fiscal year Implement
 
07:43:49.788 --> 07:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
around uh three to five hundred thousand
 
07:43:53.150 --> 07:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in maintenance uh contracts
 
07:43:56.150 --> 07:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so uh we would anticipate that we
 
07:43:57.770 --> 07:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
could do this probably over a two-year
 
07:43:57.780 --> 07:44:00.948 align:start position:0%
could do this probably over a two-year
period

07:44:00.948 --> 07:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:02.208 --> 07:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:44:04.730 --> 07:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
07:44:07.490 --> 07:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative oh thank you Mr

chairman uh thanks for answering my
question

07:44:10.128 --> 07:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:44:12.650 --> 07:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
so is this item number five on your list
 
07:44:14.270 --> 07:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
or am I
 
07:44:16.788 --> 07:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
is it another the brand new one for you
 
07:44:18.708 --> 07:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
right so this is in addition to the
 
07:44:18.718 --> 07:44:20.030 align:start position:0%
right so this is in addition to the
governors

07:44:20.030 --> 07:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
governors
 
07:44:21.708 --> 07:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
Capital he did not the governor did not
 
07:44:24.170 --> 07:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
include this in his capital budget so
 
07:44:25.070 --> 07:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
we're bringing it to your attention
 
07:44:30.850 --> 07:44:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:33.948 --> 07:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
further further question uh yes uh thank

something verbal now or just saying
 
07:44:45.708 --> 07:44:45.718 align:start position:0%

07:44:50.930 --> 07:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
an official an official
 
07:44:53.270 --> 07:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to speak on a third of the
 
07:44:54.230 --> 07:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
Jimmy but I'm just trying to figure out
 
07:44:55.670 --> 07:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
how they're going to do it uh thank you
 
07:44:59.090 --> 07:44:59.100 align:start position:0%

sounds good we we will await any further
questions

07:45:02.750 --> 07:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:04.490 --> 07:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner or anything else you would
 
07:45:06.530 --> 07:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
like to uh bring I could talk all day
 
07:45:08.208 --> 07:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
about the agency and all the great work
 
07:45:09.590 --> 07:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing but I appreciate your time
 
07:45:12.170 --> 07:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I will follow up with a few things
 
07:45:13.850 --> 07:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I do have one more and I'm sorry
 
07:45:16.548 --> 07:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
that's okay the uh Tramway project is
 
07:45:21.048 --> 07:45:21.058 align:start position:0%
put in by the governor uh for not using
 
07:45:23.690 --> 07:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
Capital funds but using cash of some
 
07:45:26.090 --> 07:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
sort of arpa funds
 
07:45:29.510 --> 07:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's enough monies there to do
 
07:45:29.520 --> 07:45:30.468 align:start position:0%
um so there's enough monies there to do
that

07:45:30.468 --> 07:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:45:32.810 --> 07:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
so do we need to reduce it to a chair
 
07:45:35.030 --> 07:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
lift what do we need to do we're really
 
07:45:37.730 --> 07:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
hoping for a tram yeah um this would be
 
07:45:40.548 --> 07:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
tram three we're celebrating the tram's
 
07:45:43.250 --> 07:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
80th anniversary this year
 
07:45:44.810 --> 07:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I do have if you're interested I have
 
07:45:46.730 --> 07:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
the same one-page handout that I handed
 
07:45:48.830 --> 07:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
out to the Senate it was the Senate bill
 
07:45:51.010 --> 07:45:51.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 55
 
07:45:54.170 --> 07:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
that I can pass out or Brian if you
 
07:45:55.730 --> 07:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
could pass it around just so you can see
 
07:45:57.830 --> 07:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
how we explained this need to the state
 
07:45:57.840 --> 07:45:59.150 align:start position:0%
how we explained this need to the state
senate

07:45:59.150 --> 07:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
senate
 
07:46:01.850 --> 07:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
um and uh the belief or the
 
07:46:04.670 --> 07:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they would grapple
 
07:46:07.070 --> 07:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
with it to hope that they could find
 
07:46:09.590 --> 07:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
enough money in the revenue
 
07:46:11.810 --> 07:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay one-time spending
 
07:46:14.628 --> 07:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
all right thank you anything else you'd
 
07:46:17.208 --> 07:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
