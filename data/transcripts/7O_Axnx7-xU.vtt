it's probably best that we have a motion
 
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.550 align:start position:0%
it's probably best that we have a motion
to

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.070 align:start position:0%

the replaced item and then we will have
 
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.790 align:start position:0%
the replaced item and then we will have
discussion

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
yeah the motion is so that we can begin
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
our discussion okay actually I think we
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
can just
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%

with me here's our Broadband program
manager

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could sure go through the
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
replacement item and want to start by
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
thanking uh you madam chair and members
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
of the committee for scheduling this
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
special meeting and making the trip down
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
here for uh today to consider this item
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just take a quick moment to
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
give you a little background on how we
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
have gotten here today
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
the history of the history of the
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
history of broadband expansion in New
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire particularly in rural areas
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
has been one of frustration
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
despite a well-known need in these
 
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
communities to access an Internet that
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
becomes a more necessary part of
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
everyday life with each day that passes
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
there has been a lack of progress made
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
local select boards Broadband committees
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
planning agencies and others have been
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
unable to Garner the resources necessary
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
to make investments in high-speed
 
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.009 align:start position:0%
to make investments in high-speed
broadband

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
a major reason for this has been the
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
fact that many areas of the state
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
particularly in population centers have
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
excellent Broadband coverage and have
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
Federal funding agencies have seen this
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
and interpret it as a state that looks
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
largely served
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in most funding that
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
has been made available nationally being
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
sent to other states largely in the
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
South with large percentages of their
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
populations without any service at all
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
just a few years ago 20 percent of
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
Mississippi had no internet access in
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
lots of in areas of their state
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
on the ground here in New Hampshire this
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
has caused many efforts to expand
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
Broadband to lose momentum and has
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
resulted in massive service disparities
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
effectively creating a system of haves
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
and have-nots
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
from my perspective as someone charged
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
with advancing our state's economy this
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
is an untenable situation
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
even before covid we had large portions
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
of our state population without access
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
to a major tool for working learning
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
accessing health care and financial
 
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.110 align:start position:0%
accessing health care and financial
management

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
during and after covid these tools have
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
become even more the norm and continued
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
disparity is impacting our economy and
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
making us less competitive
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
then in 2021 the state was awarded 122
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars to expand the reach of
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
our Broadband infrastructure
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
funds that would enable us to finally
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
answer the call from these communities
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
this time this moment in time is an
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we have never seen
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
before nor do I think we will see again
 
00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
the opportunity we have to provide
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
access at scale Statewide is one we
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
cannot pass up
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we received These funds we set a
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
goal of moving quickly and efficiently
 
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
we designed a competitive 50 million
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
dollar Statewide program that sought to
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
get broadband service to the most number
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
of unserved and underserved locations in
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
the quickest and most efficient way
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
possible we have accomplished that under
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
round one of this program we will be
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
bringing service to 23 000 locations at
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
a cost of two thousand one hundred
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
dollars per location
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that rate is the second lowest cost of
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
per location of any state and
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
construction is already underway
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
our request today is to enable us to
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
bring that same success to a second
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
round aiming to bring at least 15 000
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
more new locations online this time for
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars enabling this work to
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
begin immediately upon completion of
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
in addition our item today includes an
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
accept and expend request for the next
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
part of our Broadband work this 25
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
million dollar request will fund the
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
first round of the Broadband matching
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
Grant initiative or bmgi that is
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
designed to fill out areas that are not
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
addressed under the Broadband connect
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
program and we are requesting to use the
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
remaining 25 million dollars of the
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
capital project fund under this item and
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
at the same time committing to use
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
another 40 million dollars of funds we
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
are due to receive under the iija the
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Federal infrastructure
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
legislation enacted in November of 2021
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
I can't understate the degree to which
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
access to broadband has become a central
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
part of the state's economy
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
making these types of investments will
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
now will literally will pay off
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
literally for decades and put New
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a position to compete in an
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
economy that is increasingly accessed
 
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
over the Internet small businesses large
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers remote workers families
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
and the elderly are all finding more and
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
more ways to be productive to do their
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
business and to stay healthy by using
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
the internet communities without it will
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
be left behind perhaps never to make up
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
that ground that could be lost
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
so once again thanks for this
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity and Mark and I are here to
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have on
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
thanks Madam chair uh thanks
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner Mark for appearing
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
so a number of us have had questions and
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
some of them haven't been answered yet I
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
checked with Mr Kane just a few minutes
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
ago and I'm still kind of waiting on
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
questions uh that I've had for at least
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
a week or two and I know Mark and I
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
tried to connect via the telephone but
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
we're never successful
 
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.509 align:start position:0%
we're never successful
uh

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
the concern I have is we're not
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
following if you will the law that we
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
established make sure that as many
 
00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:43.339 align:start position:0%
possible communities could get service
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
and we've gone this route that's kind of
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
bypassed the process that was so heavily
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
debated as far as the Broadband matching
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
Grant initiative and I know and I
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you brought that back
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
with the 25 million dollars today but
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
I've heard from so many people prior to
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
our special meeting and prior to our
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
last meeting when we tabled the item
 
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
that they've tried repeatedly I'll take
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
the town of Hancock for instance it's um
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
just north of Peterborough they have
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
areas that have dial up still they've
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
made I think two separate applications
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
for funding and been denied what
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
assurances because you just told us that
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
you see fifteen thousand new hookups if
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem like an awful lot so
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
the people in Hancock are they gonna
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
have any possibility of getting service
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
or are they going to be pushed back on
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
another burner other communities up
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
north because it just seems that this
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been rolled out that well we're
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
still looking for maps we've asked uh
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that how do we stand where
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
are the areas that have service or no
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
service I know you've got several
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
different definitions of underserved and
 
00:14:58.199 --> 00:14:59.090 align:start position:0%
different definitions of underserved and
um

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
if that still says that people within
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
those years do have some sort of
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
broadband but it doesn't say who doesn't
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
have anything or has dial up so that's a
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
question I've been putting forward for
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
weeks about where are the areas that
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
have nothing have those been identified
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
as priorities that I can't seem to get
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
an answer so so you got a lot there let
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
me try to let me try to get some of
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
those representative so with regard to
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh bmgi I think it's important to point
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
um we had to make some changes to that
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
legislation in the previous legislative
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
session in order to make the program
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
align with the program rules for the
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
capital project fund the federal money
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
that we were going to use to fund the
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
bmgi program
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
and so Mark and the team uh at in our
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
Broadband office worked with legislators
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with a number of changes to
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
the pre the previously enacted bmgi
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
Statute in order to make those
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
accommodations one of which was to
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
change the match uh to a 75 percent
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
match on the side of the state for that
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
program we achieved that at the end of
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
the session last year in July and worked
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
immediately went to a JL card to start
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
the interim moves process which we
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
actually completed just prior to our
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
last fiscal meeting so as far as the
 
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.180 align:start position:0%
standpoint from where we are
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
that is very much within the schedule
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
that we have been pursuing which has
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
been to get bmgi in position to be uh to
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
utilized with the funding under the
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
substantial funding that we have
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
available to us under Capital project
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
fund and ultimately under the iija and
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
to use those funds to effectively
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
backfill the program of the Broadband
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
connect program the Broadband connect
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
program has been put in place in order
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
to effectively get to those low-hanging
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
fruit let's call it places in the state
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
that have have had long-term difficulty
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
in getting service for high-speed
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
broadband and broadband service
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
generally so the the competitive process
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
that we used identified those areas and
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
we're now hitting what did I say 23 000
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
different locations and how many
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
73 communities six counties all North
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
and Western 73 communities around the
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
state so
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
as part of that process we recognize
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
that there were still some areas that we
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
could get with this program with the
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
Broadband connect program and so we
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
initiated a second round
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
that will that we are asking for the
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
accept and expend today to mirror those
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
those results
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
bmgi is a program that will be a
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
partnership between providers internet
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
service providers and local communities
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
to identify places literally like at the
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
end of cul-de-sacs within their
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
communities within their regions to
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
jointly make that application to
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
continue the sustainability the build up
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
of a sustainable Broadband
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within the state so I
 
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:09.380 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize that
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is all part of a long-term strategy
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
with a significant amount of resource
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
that gets us in a place to be able to
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
set a foundation of reaching communities
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
that just frankly have not been touched
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
from many years in a substantial way get
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
those online use the Broadband connect
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
program to build up I'm sorry the bmgi
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
program to build up the areas that would
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
be not covered under the Broadband
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
connect program all said and done by the
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
time we spend 122 million dollars under
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
this program Plus at least an additional
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars that we are
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
expecting out of the iija program that
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
should be a very resilient Broadband
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Network for the state
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up if I could manage here
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
yes you may thank you
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
so you just struck a nerve with me you
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
said that you're going to try to touch
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
those areas that haven't been touched do
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
you have that
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
a list of those communities that will be
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
touched under this program like again
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
I'll use Hancock for instance because
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
I'm more familiar with that are they
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
going to be touched by this program I
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically if Hancock was
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
um round one we have just received the
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
applications for round two so I wouldn't
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
be able to say at this stage what the
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
towns are that would be under the
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
winning uh awardee but I again I I
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
having having reviewed the applications
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
of round one we did not see a
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
significant amount of overlap in a lot
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
of those applications so I would expect
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
that we will see new communities in part
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
certain areas of the state that would be
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
covered under round two and then again
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
we still have the bmgi program that will
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
be coming behind that
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
I'll let someone else go up next
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Rosenwald thank you madam
 
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Rosenwald thank you madam
chair

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
um I see that this if
 
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:18.860 align:start position:0%
uh accept this item we will have spent
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
all but five million dollars of that 122
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
million and I'm just wondering why
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
you're why you're holding back that 5
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
million is it a requirement or well it's
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
a combination of things we've also
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
funded the mapping program as you recall
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
um there might have been one other
 
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.570 align:start position:0%
um there might have been one other
program

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
yes so uh to continue uh uh some
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
assistance with a consultant that we
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
will be having an RFP for shortly and
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
then the administrative costs of the
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
department so paying Mark and his and
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um good morning thank you very much
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things
 
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.950 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things
um

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the fact that you've
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
accelerated the bmgi funding
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
um to put the 25 million dollars into
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
what I think that will have a better
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
chance of reaching those areas of the
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
state that
 
00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
state that
um

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:28.340 align:start position:0%
may not have been touched with round one
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
and who knows exactly the winning bidder
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
of round two
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that's vitally important
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that to me that was one
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
of the bigger problems of the fiscal
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
committee consideration two weeks ago
 
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.890 align:start position:0%
committee consideration two weeks ago
um

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this you know
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
privately but can you
 
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.529 align:start position:0%
privately but can you
um

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about the iiga
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
funds and where they are when we can
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
expect them and
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um how guaranteed they are I think
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's a critical component
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
so I'll start and I'll ask Mark if he
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
has anything he wants to add on this but
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
I do think that uh that legislation was
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
enacted just about a year ago and
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
um the federal government is in the
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
process of deploying resources under
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
that fund there have been resources that
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
have come to New Hampshire through New
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire D.O.T uh the funds that are
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
specific to broadband or under What's
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
called the bead program
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
those funds are due to become available
 
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:36.980 align:start position:0%
probably by the second quarter of
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
2023. so again in terms of the timing
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at working with here
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
having the rules in place being able to
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
launch the first 25 million using the
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
funds that we already have in hand and
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
then anticipate a point and when those
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
funds would be exhausted pull another 40
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars from that ihja program
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
further yes follow-up
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
so in the bmgi legislation
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
um when I first introduced it it was a
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
50 50 Grant then I think it was Senate
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 445 that was Senator Hennessey's
 
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
Bill 445 that was Senator Hennessey's
bill

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
um that a number of us co-sponsored it
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
changed as you noted to
 
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
changed as you noted to
um

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
75 to 25 percent but the question that I
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
have and we've again talked about this
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
offline there is a requirement under
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
bmgi that there be a provider match
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's municipality or the
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
provider and most likely the provider
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
and what you've indicated to me is that
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
as round 2 progresses and as it goes
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
before the governor or Council there'll
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
be a requirement that there be a at a
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
minimum of 25 percent matching
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
commitment by the provider is that
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
correct in case that's correct yes yes
 
00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:03.890 align:start position:0%
correct in case that's correct yes yes
sir

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
um okay so the answer to that is yes
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
questions that have Arisen out of
 
00:24:18.179 --> 00:24:19.610 align:start position:0%
questions that have Arisen out of
um

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
round one and duplication of services
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
um bmgi was meant to
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
try to get internet to areas of the
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
state that had no service so
 
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
state that had no service so
um

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
the question that has been Arisen has
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
arisen is the duplication if you will
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
and how are you going to verify the
 
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
addresses of where you know the wires
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
are going to be
um

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.450 align:start position:0%
um
installed

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
installed
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
so a number of ways as we go through the
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh award the review process for round
 
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.010 align:start position:0%
uh award the review process for round
two

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
um we we consult a number of different
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
sources including the FCC mapping data
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
that I think has been discussed
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
um previously I I I do think that that
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
by itself is not a sufficient amount of
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh address level specific data to be
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
sufficiently meet the needs under the
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
capital projects fund and so uh for
 
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:30.860 align:start position:0%
example that process the FCC
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
477 mapping really goes only down to the
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
level of census block which as you know
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is often a very large
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
geographic area so effectively if there
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
is service in that census block they
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
check the box that that has that's an
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
area that has service I think our
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
experience on the ground is that's not
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
always necessarily the case so again it
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
tends to overstate New Hampshire's
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
served population and and by itself is
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
probably an inadequate tool I would note
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
on a side note there that as a result
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
several States including New Hampshire
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
are going to be petitioning the FCC to
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
seek ways to improve that those mapping
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
tools that they uh that they have
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
available for us so in order to overcome
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
this we will be working as we have in
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
the past to review all the addresses
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
that are submitted under the RFP
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
on round two with the applications and
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
with others we will be partnering with
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
the communities that have done a
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount of work in
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
identifying served in unserved areas
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
through their own processes whether it's
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
a bonding process or whatever other
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
process they might have and we also will
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
be conducting spot testing to identify
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
the speed and reliability
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
in areas with where there is currently
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
existing services in order to make sure
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
that they are meeting with the capital
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess this is as much common as
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
um and and I think a tribute to uh the
 
00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.549 align:start position:0%
um and and I think a tribute to uh the
chair

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:07.580 align:start position:0%
um who's worked with myself and
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell to make what I
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
believe is a much stronger
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
um presentation now to the fiscal
 
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.870 align:start position:0%
um presentation now to the fiscal
committee

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
um with the commitment to move forward
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
with the next 40 million dollars of
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
funding that I think I am relatively
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
assured now is going to happen the 25
 
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.769 align:start position:0%
assured now is going to happen the 25
percent

00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
um contract matching Grant and the
 
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.090 align:start position:0%
um contract matching Grant and the
um

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
it'll be a process over time of the
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
verification of addresses but um
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
those are all very helpful and obviously
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
moving up the
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
bmgi into this proposal I think is very
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
helpful so I would hope Madam chair that
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Bradley representative
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and quick
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to get this question
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
answered since prior to our last
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
meeting and I thought it would be a very
 
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.810 align:start position:0%
meeting and I thought it would be a very
simple

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
a question to ask but how is it that the
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
intent of RSA 12-0 colon 63 Roman
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
numeral 2.
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
isn't to require that Federal Broadband
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
funds be controlled by the rsa's 12-0
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
colon 61-63 and if you're not familiar
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
with those they're essentially the
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
Broadband initiative sections
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
so can you just repeat your question for
 
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.049 align:start position:0%
so can you just repeat your question for
me

00:28:44.049 --> 00:28:44.059 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
how was it the intent of RSA 12-0 colon
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
63 Roman number two which is the one
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
that talks about putting the funds into
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
the bmgi fund we talked about putting
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
Broadband funds into the dmgi fund
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
isn't to require that Federal Broadband
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
so looking at 063
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
you established the Broadband matching
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
Grant fund the fund shall be kept
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from other funds
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
and shall be continually appropriated to
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
the to Bea for the purposes of the
 
00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.649 align:start position:0%
the to Bea for the purposes of the
subdivision

00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
any federal funds received by the state
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
for purposes of expanding or improving
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
internet access that are not otherwise
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
committed to other programs or required
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
by the federal legislation authorizing
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
the funds shall be deposited into the
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
Broadband matching Grant fund is that
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
your question that's the answer I'm
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
referring to yes and and which and
 
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.750 align:start position:0%
referring to yes and and which and
specifically

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
what about that language
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
authorizing the funds shall be deposited
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
into the Broadband matching Grant fund
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
which I assume is the bmgi fund we're
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
talking about yes sir
 
00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:58.430 align:start position:0%
talking about yes sir
so

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of expanding or
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
improving internet access that are not
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise committed to other programs
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
so the not otherwise committed to other
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
programs is what your
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's what you're suggesting is the out
 
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.090 align:start position:0%
that's what you're suggesting is the out
to

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
that's what you're going by they
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
consider that that is the authorization
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
for us to run the Broadband connect
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
program as well as bmgi
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you for that certainly
 
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you for that certainly
so

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify this in my mind
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
the understanding is that a law drafted
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
in 2021 which is when hb2 which is the
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
law that we're talking about here was
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
drafted and signed into law
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
by a combination it actually has to be
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
85 but sp85 didn't come into effect
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
the understanding that that was drafted
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
in 2021 during a time when was unclear
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
what federal restrictions would apply to
 
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:54.740 align:start position:0%
a distribution or Broadband funds
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
included a clause that intended to give
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
whichever state agency would oversee the
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds broad discretion
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
to ignore the law as drafted and do what
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
they chose with the funds as opposed to
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
the Clause that same Clause we're
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
referring to here being included as part
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
of the effort of the drafting of that
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislation to not lose the federal
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
funding due to an inconsistency between
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws and as I'm sure
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
you're aware in other areas of the of
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
that law there are specific references
 
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
let Mark talk a little bit about this
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
issue he's been
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
foreign hi there thank you for the
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
question so when we read this again any
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
federal funds received by the state for
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
the purposes of expanding or improving
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
internet access that are not already
 
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:52.580 align:start position:0%
otherwise committed to other programs
 
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is why we are here I think for us
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
other programs are this program the RFP
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
process and that was why it was so
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
important and we have said this back in
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
2021 we said this during the 445 SB 445
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
and why we went to fiscal in July to
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
approve round one is to get that those
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
funds as we say committed to other
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
programs so we've been open about saying
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay these are how we're going to
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
utilize these funds and put them into
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
these programs and get the approval of
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
the proper entities both fiscal and
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up yes please thank you
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
for that I actually did try to read
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
through the Senate minutes from I
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
believe the meeting you're referring to
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
regarding SB uh 85 from 2021.
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
um could you just refer me to where it
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
where you raise those issues at that
 
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.649 align:start position:0%
where you raise those issues at that
meeting

00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
we actually raised it at February 1st
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
2022 during the Senate Bill 445. the
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
whole process is when we received this
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
funding uh we got this information for
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
this funding for capital projects that
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
was in September of 2021 and actually as
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
we were reading drafts and the final
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
bill for infrastructure it was clear
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to make sure that when we
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
had Broadband matching Grant initiative
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
ready to go that the funding source the
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
funding and the law itself could could
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
coincide plus there was also an ask
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
about the changes in the match and that
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
was from both municipalities and isps
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
had reached out about that so that's why
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
we went through that process
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
if you remember at the time when we went
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
through this process there was going to
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
be a commitment of an x amount of money
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
into the Broadband matching Grant
 
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.690 align:start position:0%
into the Broadband matching Grant
initiative

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
um during that process we were clear
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to be able to have the
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility to utilize those funds but
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
in exchange we would come to fiscal and
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for anything that
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
we decided to do what programs we wanted
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
to move forward with so that was during
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
the conversations in February of 2022
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the amendment
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that I really
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
wish I could have gotten that
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
information a month ago when this whole
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
process started so that I would not have
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
been put in this position but thank you
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn did you have a
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
question no okay
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'm sorry Senator uh Khan
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
passing this uh today provides some
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
clarity to towns that are
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
have committees up and running
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh that are trying to
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
follow the guidance that we've provided
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
and it might have Broadband bonding and
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
town meetings coming up where an action
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
today will help that overall
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
communication throughout the state I
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
think that's important
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh I also think that uh
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
understanding because we won't reach all
 
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:02.060 align:start position:0%
of the need with this
 
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:05.060 align:start position:0%
allocation with this proposal
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that with the promise that there is
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
more coming
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
through a defined process the
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
legislature has participated in
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
that encourages towns to come forward
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
with proposals which is what the bmgi
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
was designed to promote in partnership
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
with providers
 
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.230 align:start position:0%
with providers
um

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
to understand then what is that full
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
build out and I I think I'm through this
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
process Madam chair I think we have
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
learned there's been a more disclosure
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
of what those dollars are 25 million and
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
40 million that are known today can you
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
add something more to that as to what
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
those decisions might be you said by
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
June site at the end of the second
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
quarter you might
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
no further about iija funding
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
what would that be so that the towns
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are active not receiving funding in
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
this next round to solve their what
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
their overall needs
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh so that as they
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
come forward with their proposals public
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
hearings that they need to hold between
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
the second quarter of
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
23 and the end of calendar 23. I'm
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
trying to then get that that picture
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
that you can paint for us as the how How
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
deep the bucket is going to be uh it's
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
more than 65 million dollars
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah and so um I guess in
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
terms of the process is that sort of
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
where you're going with this like how
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to proceed or I'm I'm
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a dollar amount how I you
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
can put a border on that uh border that
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
that amount clearly it's no less than 65
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars so the amount of money
 
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.180 align:start position:0%
we expect to see under iija yeah yeah
 
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.010 align:start position:0%
we expect to see under iija yeah yeah
okay

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I I might let Mark answer that
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
question he's been really uh in
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
communication with U.S treasury uh way
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
more than I have so he might have some
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
insight for you on that
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes so it's a separate program so
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
capital projects fund is do U.S treasury
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill is ntia and the
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
FCC working together
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
they have that program bead program
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
which is the majors funding source for
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
that program is 42.5 billion dollars
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
Nationwide every state is going to
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
receive a minimum of 100 million dollars
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that final allocation
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
is going to be they're going to going to
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
tell us that sometime in mid to late
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
June of 2023. so that number could be
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
higher we don't know so we're we but to
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
be do what we're doing we have to stay
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
with I think the most conservative
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
number we can and treat it as a hundred
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars so you would have that
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
40 million dollar commitment there's
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
still 60 million minimal minimum that we
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
could look at for other avenues and
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
those funding mechanisms are for
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
unserved then underserved in what's
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
called tier three is connecting anchor
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
institutions so working with communities
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
to determine other areas that to make
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
sure that communities are connected
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond just locations but work with the
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities determine what some of their
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
needs are
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
and the timing for The Madam chair
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
please go in timing then that you see
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
for subsequent rounds would be what
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the census you get the number in June
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we're we have um been getting an
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
indication from the Feds that we're in
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
the right track moving forward with
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
everything so my sense is by the end of
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
2023 we should be being able to utilize
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
those funds for additional programs and
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
these funds I believe go until 2028 so
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
um whatever that number may be and like
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
I said if it's 100 or 120 or whatever
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
that may be we'll have a better sense
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
when that happens we can let you know
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
that because we do that quarterly report
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
for fiscal to get that information out
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
we can include that information in part
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
of that report so then when we know more
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
we can tell you all
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and I can call you directly
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
because you won't be on this committee
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
anymore if you want
 
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Edward you had a question
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'm generally in support of this
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not voting today but uh as I'm
 
00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:41.339 align:start position:0%
listening to this we heard a description
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
from representative leishman that we
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
still have places out there relying on
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
dial-up and uh I I think it's going to
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
be great when those dial-up places get a
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
100 Meg by 100 Meg but the technologists
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
I've been talking to
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
um suggests that we're going to be going
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
to an eight gig standard in 2025 or 26
 
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:08.540 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be rolled out nationally with
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
five five gig down three gig up which
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
will be amazing that'll support all
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
kinds of 3D applications and immersive
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
Technologies and so so my question for
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
you is as as we're investing this money
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
now are we basically going from sort of
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
a horse and buggy era to a Model T or a
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
right when we see you know the
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
interstate highway system getting ready
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be rolled out are we are we
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
anticipating well this technology
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
deployment uh support the emerging eight
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
gig standard not the hundred hundred Meg
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
so in in a Senate bill 85s and then the
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
bmgi law one of the things that was put
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
in there is that we need to look at at
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
least what the next steps are how do we
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
get everybody at least one gig that was
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
more I don't know if it's aspirational
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
or but look for strategies to get to us
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
at that point so it's not quite the five
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
and three but it certainly was an
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
indication from this legislature to look
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
to the next steps so during our process
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
not only did we meet with all of the
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
providers of landline of of ground fiber
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
wired but we also met with starlink we
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
also met with project Kuiper which is
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
Amazon we've met with a lot of different
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
people to kind of give us a sense of
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
what are the next steps and we hear that
 
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
and so the great part about it is is
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
like yeah you could go from there you
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
could go to even higher we're hearing
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
the different companies saying well
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
these Technologies bring us all the way
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
up to 2gig right now so what can we do
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
for more than that I think where
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
bead is going to come into plan the
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
connecting anchor institutions talks
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
about what you're looking to do because
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have hospitals
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to be looking at that sort
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
of for example hospitals if they have to
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
send x-rays or some very intense
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
um documents they want us to be looking
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
at that we talk to the Telehealth people
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
about that so we have to keep an eye on
 
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:11.780 align:start position:0%
that and I think our process through
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
bead and the iija will be to do that and
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
keeping track of that sort of thing and
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I think they've also extended
 
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
it to 2028 so we'll certainly be trying
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
to stay on not not necessarily the
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
bleeding edge but The Cutting Edge of
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes you may one uh thank you madam chair
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay so I I just want to put something
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
Away In My Memory Bank on this what I
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
think I'm hearing you say is that yes
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
you're aware of the emerging gains that
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeking in our Broadband bandwidth
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh but what I'm not hearing directly is
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
that yes you believe that the
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
Technologies we're investing in and
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
deploying are going to be inherently
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
capable of that because I'm concerned
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
that if we aren't inherently capable of
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
meeting that next technology wave then
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
we will be back here in five years
 
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:07.220 align:start position:0%
looking for another
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars so I I just want to
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
make sure we're we're investing in a
 
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:14.780 align:start position:0%
flexible way or a way that will support
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
I believe the way that we're doing it
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
and then the feds using their guidance
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been using it we're future
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
proofing the internet for the State of
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so yes I believe the
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
technologies will get us to those places
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
I believe that the infrastructure will
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Daniels
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
that there are continuously shout there
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
some with no service and some that are
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
underserved slower speeds uh We've also
 
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:51.980 align:start position:0%
established that the money that's being
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
requested today will not cover
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
everyone so my question is about the
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
process of selecting in your selection
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
process as to where this money is uh to
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
be used
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit about uh how
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to be used when you compare
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
the underserved versus the no service is
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
one going to have a a priority over the
 
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.770 align:start position:0%
one going to have a a priority over the
other

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
so in the RFP process that was we were
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the to the the applicants
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
to determine those areas and so that way
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
we weren't necessarily picking the
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
winners or losers so we're going to let
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone apply and then we go through
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
the verification process and do what
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
needed to be done in that way
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
bmgi will be municipalities working
 
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
directly with the providers themselves
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
in in a local area to make those
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
determinations as well and what's going
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be great is that they will the
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have a say in
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
working with whom they decide to work
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
with so those questions can be answered
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
by them and for us we'll be granting
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
providing the resources based upon the
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
application and making sure everything
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
is approved and that the scoring
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
requirements are met but those things
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
will have happened at the municipal
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
level between the towns and the
 
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.349 align:start position:0%
level between the towns and the
providers

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
I do have one are there any further
 
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
I do have one are there any further
questions

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
I do have one uh quick question
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
um when I read the RFP uh it indicated
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
the proposals had to be in by the 28th
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell me how many people apply
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
I can say how many three okay thank you
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.170 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.630 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
well the clerk please call the roll
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
the uh leishman Bradley motion at the
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
very beginning so that we could um
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
Emrick votes
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
representative erf yes
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative leishman yes
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yes
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels yes Senator Moore I mean
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
sorry Senator Bradley yes Senator gray
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Rosenwald yes Senator Khan
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative umberger yes Madam
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
chair the vote is 10-0 in favor the vote
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
being ten to zero the uh replacement FIS
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
22404 passes
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
and um I just want to thank everybody
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
for uh coming out to this meeting today
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank Bea for the work
 
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
accomplished in the last week or two
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
with Thanksgiving interrupting a lot of
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
a lot of what was going on
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
so there will be no other fiscal
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
committee meeting in the month of
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
December I can see big smiles from
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
from people that may be serving on it
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
next year so our our first fiscal
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
committee meeting will be in January
 
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.650 align:start position:0%
committee meeting will be in January
sometime

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
so with uh nothing else I will oh yes
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really important that we
