long time since we've been able to
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%

this morning um
 
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
this morning um
so

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
it has been a long year to be sure
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
i think we were all looking forward to
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
2021 a racing 2020
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
but we had challenges ahead of us
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
without a doubt and so what i wanted to
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
do this morning is talk a little bit
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
about some of the things that we've
 
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.190 align:start position:0%
about some of the things that we've
encountered

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
encountered
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think how we faced a lot of those
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
challenges in that i think it sets a
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
model for how to be proactive how to be
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
positive how not to back away from
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
things and then really look forward
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
prospectively in terms of what we can
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
get done i think in the next year
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that we have set a lot
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
of good standards and good models and we
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
can build off that to be sure
 
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.230 align:start position:0%
can build off that to be sure
but

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
let's start a little bit behind us in
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
terms of covet right since we've all
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
gotten together two years ago it was i
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.549 align:start position:0%
think uh
february

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
february
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
of 2020 just before the pandemic hit
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have to recognize that we have lost
 
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.710 align:start position:0%
we have to recognize that we have lost
over

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
2300 individuals to covet and i think i
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
speak for all of us when i say that our
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
hearts just go out to their those
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
families go out to those individuals
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
who have had to deal with this pandemic
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
and this tragedy uh who that hit us hard
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't see it coming but we buckled
 
00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
we didn't see it coming but we buckled
down

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
covet has been very tough but new
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been very strong
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're resilient we're putting systems
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
and policies in place that don't just
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
make us like everybody else right
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
they separate us from the pack and i
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
think they really capitalize on a lot of
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity we have uh right here in
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
so let's jump into a little bit of an
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
update let's start with some good news
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
right we don't want to always start on
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
the negative you have to acknowledge the
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
negative but there has been some really
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%

america for public safety we are first
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
in america for economic freedom and we
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
continue to have the lowest poverty rate
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
and some of the highest wages in this
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
country those are big wins for our
 
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:37.350 align:start position:0%
country those are big wins for our
citizens

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
so when you go down that list you can
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
see ranking after ranking shows that the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
granite state is the place to be america
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
not just new england but america is
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
truly taking notice
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh we are very proud that our way of
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
life here in the 603 is simply the best
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the best but we did not get here by
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
accident right we did it through smart
 
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.389 align:start position:0%
accident right we did it through smart
management

00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
tough work prioritizing individuals over
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
government prioritizing citizens over
 
00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:03.190 align:start position:0%
government prioritizing citizens over
systems

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
and delivering results with the immense
 
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.710 align:start position:0%
and delivering results with the immense
responsibility

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
of managing our taxpayer dollars and
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
knowing that you have to balance budgets
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
because i believe as in the public
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
sector there's no greater responsibility
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
than managing someone else's money and
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
this legislature has done a tremendous
 
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.909 align:start position:0%
this legislature has done a tremendous
job

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
so as as other states we saw other
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
states across this country really buckle
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
down to weather the storm of 2021 but we
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
took a much more proactive approach in
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
the past year
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
in just the last year we've cut the
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
statewide property tax we talk about
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes all the time and this
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislature cut it by a hundred million
 
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:50.470 align:start position:0%
legislature cut it by a hundred million
dollars

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
we cut the room in meals tax we cut
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
business taxes again
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
and we're now permanently phasing out
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
our interest in dividends taxes again
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
reducing that burden on our citizens
 
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.470 align:start position:0%
reducing that burden on our citizens
[Applause]

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
and those were tough decisions to make
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
without a doubt we heard a lot of scary
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
stories how if you cut taxes
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't have money to push
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
down to the cities and towns if he cut
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
taxes we're going to have to slash all
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
of our programs
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
but the way we design this has played
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
out exactly as we anticipated we cut
 
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.910 align:start position:0%
out exactly as we anticipated we cut
taxes

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
and what happened
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've now exceeded all of our
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
expectations in terms of surpluses and
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
we've doubled the rainy day fund to over
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
look a few years ago you guys were here
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we would get excited if
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
we had a surplus of 25 million oh that
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
gives us a lot of opportunity we manage
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
well we balance the budget we have some
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to spend in a little
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure what's the situation
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
today we're going to have about 10 times
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
that amount again to make real long-term
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
investments in infrastructure and make
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
sure we do it without putting any
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
additional burden
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
onto our citizens and at at the state
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
level we've had great financial success
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
by cutting these taxes and drawing all
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
of this business in right but let's not
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
forget local governments as well have
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
had unprecedented amounts of financial
 
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
had unprecedented amounts of financial
opportunity

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
federal support has been very powerful
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
here in the state there's no doubt about
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
that federal support has put over 600
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars into our education
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
system alone
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh over the next couple years then you
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in dollars spent
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
you had another 250 million dollars in
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
the general federal support that came
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
through the arpa funding that goes down
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
to every city every town every county in
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state and then you add on what this
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislature did with a hundred million
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of property tax relief
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
with the fact that not only did we cut
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
room and meals tax here's an amazing
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
thing we cut meals and rooms tax for all
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
our citizens and we increased the amount
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're sending back to cities and towns
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
thanks to senator rachardi over there
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're increasing that by 45 percent
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
cut taxes up here cut taxes for citizens
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
send more back to cities and towns it's
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount of money to offset
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of those local costs so instead of
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
downshifting costs which we hear a lot
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
about you know historically decades ago
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're now downshifting cash
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a win for our citizens
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
because in these with these investments
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is many towns are now
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
lowering their property taxes i i got to
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
be honest if your town is not lowering
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
their property taxes town meeting is
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
like a month right
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
go to town meeting fight for because
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
your towns have unprecedented amount of
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
money unprecedented amount of
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity and so while the state can't
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
control cutting property taxes by
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
sending this opportunity back to cities
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
and towns yet again it takes that
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
pressure off the entire system and
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
creates opportunities that a lot of
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
folks never thought that they would see
 
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
folks never thought that they would see
now

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
we let me let's take a little bit of a
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
step back with cove right it's still
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
here we know we're going to be grappling
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
that with a while
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
so last year our nation continued
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
through the covet pandemic it strained
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
our health care system we saw that very
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
upfront and personal it tested us like
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
never before we're still dealing with
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
things that a lot of us never thought
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
we'd have to deal with in terms of the
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
public sector or our private lives or
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
with our businesses
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
and while other states while the surge
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
that winter surge really hit the country
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
other states were
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
you could watch them they were kind of
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
caught flat-footed
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
but we took a forward-looking
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
perspective we prepared for what we knew
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
would be a tough winter back in the
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
summer and fall dr chan and commissioner
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
shiban and i were talking about that
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
winter surge preparing for that winter
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
surge and we knew that government can't
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
solve cove government is not going to be
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
able to solve a viral pandemic
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
but when we came together
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
we cut red tape we flexed open our
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
health care system to meet our citizens
 
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.390 align:start position:0%
health care system to meet our citizens
needs

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so what were the results of that
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
well when you look at what's happened
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
just over the past year new hampshire
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
was the fastest state in the country
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
with the initial vaccine rollout which
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
meant that we were the first state in
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
the country to really allow vaccines for
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
anyone who wanted it again creating a
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
lot of flexibility
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
you look at what we've done recently we
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
delivered one and a half million
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
home free home tests click a button two
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
days later amazon was dropping them on
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
your doorstep we did that twice and then
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government realized that we
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
had a pretty darn good model and they
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
well they copied it although i saw the
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
wmur story last night they're not doing
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
a very good job with that i don't know
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
who ordered the free test from the
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
federal government apparently they're
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
still figuring out postage or something
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
people are waiting weeks for those
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
things but
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
leave it to the feds to screw up a good
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
idea but here in new hampshire we did it
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
really well
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
we did it really well and the fact is we
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
did it so well you had the federal
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
government copying our our program and
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're able to kind of do it a third time
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
with what we're with the availability of
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
tests that we now have coming out of our
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
liquor stores
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
we we looked looked at what was going to
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
happen in our classrooms we looked at
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
how hard those last those i guess those
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
spring months of 2020 had been on our
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids and we said we're going to keep our
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
schools open and we're going to keep
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
schools children safely in our
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms we built out internal surge
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
centers within the hospitals we cut red
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
tape we fast tracked hundreds of new
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
nursing licenses in just a few weeks in
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
december we cut that red tape we moved
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
it forward and we got those folks on the
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
floors of our hospitals it was really
 
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.710 align:start position:0%
floors of our hospitals it was really
awesome

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
we strategically deployed a lot of the
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
dollars to help our health care
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
providers and our long-term providers
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
our long-term care providers
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then when the federal government
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
continually kept mixing the messages up
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
right that say one thing one week one
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
thing the next we were out there every
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
week trying to kind of straighten it out
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
as best we could for our citizens there
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
was a lot of mismanagement at the
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
federal level and so then they panicked
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they came down with their illegal
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
mandates and we stood up against the
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
illegal mandates and we won and we beat
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
them back in court for our citizens and
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we know we've new hampshire has
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
consistently ranked amongst being one of
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
the safest states when it comes to covet
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
now having one of the lowest
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization rates in the country and
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
we did it without sacrificing those
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
freedoms that we hold dear we kept
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
businesses open and we let individuals
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
and communities decide what was going to
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
best work for them but we also didn't go
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
to extremes we didn't tell small
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
businesses who you could hire and who
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
you could fire we know it's not right to
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
infringe on those businesses rights and
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is not what the live free or die
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
state is all about
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
we used a team approach
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
everything has to be team it wasn't just
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
me sitting up here you know dictating
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
from from the top those models don't
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
work right by incorporating the
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislature by incorporating the fiscal
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee by incorporating
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
our teams at health and human services
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the department of public health
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
making sure we put all those ideas on
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
we listen to our citizens we engage them
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
we ask them what they thought in these
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
processes we let them take the
 
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.150 align:start position:0%
processes we let them take the
responsibility

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
of figuring out
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
where we could go where we could go
 
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
where we could go where we could go
locally

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
locally
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's never easy to be sure it's not a
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
one size fits all we had some tough
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
battles not just at the state level but
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
at the local level you see some of those
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
conversations happening to be sure
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
but the nation has taken notice
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
the nation has taken notice of our
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
success and we've achieved them here in
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
so when we look at crafting guidance to
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
keep the economy open that was done
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
because we asked businesses and citizens
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
what they wanted to see
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the resiliency that we
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
could deliver as granite staters and how
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
that translated to actually what was
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
happening in our neighborhoods in our
 
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.230 align:start position:0%
happening in our neighborhoods in our
communities

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
we weren't resilient because the
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
government said be resilient
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
we were resilient because we believed in
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
the individual we were resilient because
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
we believed that we could communicate
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
and have some tough battles over some of
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
these issues but get to a place where at
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it really really
 
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.589 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it really really
worked

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
so now we're moving forward
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the state and we're moving forward
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
with the mindset that covid may be here
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
for quite some time is it going to be
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
gone this summer i would love to be able
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
to say it is but we don't know that
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
could be here for years
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
but we can manage
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
we can absolutely manage we have the
 
00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
we can absolutely manage we have the
model

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
and now it's time that we turn new
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
normal remember that term let's turn new
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
normal back to old normal the pandemic
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
of 2022
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
is not like march of 2020 because we
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
have so many more tools in our toolbox
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have the vaccines we have boosters we
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
have the at home tests we know so much
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
more we continue to let data and science
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
dictate where we go with some of these
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
decisions just as we have since the very
 
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.309 align:start position:0%
decisions just as we have since the very
beginning

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
but let's also recognize a group of
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
individuals that i know we all want to
 
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
individuals that i know we all want to
thank

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
none of this is possible right just
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
because government says so no matter how
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
good we are at this level
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's only possible when you look at
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
flexing open that health care system
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
those health care workers those doctors
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
those nurses our national guard who
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
stepped up time and time again
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to take this moment on
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of everyone in this room and
 
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
i take that step back and i talk about
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
how we did it not just what we did what
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
we did was pretty great
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
but how we did it is very important as
 
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.230 align:start position:0%
but how we did it is very important as
well

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
and i know i'm reading my speech here
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm kind of going through a lot of
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
this in my head i i know it must sound
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
like i'm spending a lot of time just
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
bashing on washington but at the end of
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
the day that's where it all gets bogged
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
up we know that that's no secret
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
right when you get into washington dc
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
and unlike washington dc
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
when we say we're going to do something
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
we do it
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean we have the end-all
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
be-all answer but we figure it out
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
because that's the job that we were
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
hired to do
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we can all agree that it's a
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
long time coming that frankly
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
politicians in washington could take a
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
playbook out of new hampshire not out of
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
one party or another but out of the fact
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
that frankly we're a purple state and we
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
still find a way to get things done
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
through politics policy we can still
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
find a way to make sure that at the end
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the day we're getting results that's
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
what we're hired to do we're delivering
 
00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:45.510 align:start position:0%
what we're hired to do we're delivering
something

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
so instead of that partisan bickering
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
that perpetual gridlock we see
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
we know that complacency
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's not in our dna this is new
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire after all right it's not who
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
we are as granite staters
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
states are the ones that are really
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
leading the management of this pandemic
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic the opportunity with
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
cutting taxes the opportunity with
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
taking some financial burden off
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
individuals those are states that are
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
driving them the states of the
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
laboratories of democracy and thanks to
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
that no-nonsense approach
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we design
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire with those
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
flexible systems we meet the needs of
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
our citizens so we had a great year last
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
year all things being considered it was
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
a great year a great year of opportunity
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot more to be done
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
so last year when i delivered my
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
inaugural address it was a little
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
different i was i had to do it in the
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
television studio i don't know if
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
anybody watched
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
a little weird because i'm more i like
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
to have more conversations as opposed to
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
just delivering speeches and all of that
 
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
just delivering speeches and all of that
but

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that i really tried to focus
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
on last year coming out of 2020 was the
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
idea that we all have to come together
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean we all agree
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
but we all have to find the path
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can head into that new year
 
00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
so that we can head into that new year
united

00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
united
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
not necessarily on politics or policy
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
again but united as granite staters
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
united with the responsibility that i
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
know the 400 plus individuals in this
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
room i think do collectively share
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
when you break through that ugly
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
political divide and you see that ugly
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
political divide in a lot of other
 
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
political divide in a lot of other
places

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
we can we can and have shown that we can
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
get some amazing things done so last
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
year let's talk about some real
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives that i challenge folks with
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i know some of them were popular
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
some of them weren't popular some of
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
them needed to be hashed out a little
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
more than maybe we were ready to do
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
but let's talk about some really
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
innovative things we didn't just sit on
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
the sidelines and say well let's just
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
pass you know the budget let's just keep
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
things going and we'll let we'll see
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
what happens with covid we took the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to still jump on to certain
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
initiatives last year i talked about
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
paid family league delivering it without
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
an income tax and the result isn't we
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
just didn't talk about it we actually
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
passed that program and right now we're
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
developing frankly one of the most
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
innovative versions of paid leave that
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to find anywhere in the
 
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.710 align:start position:0%
you're going to find anywhere in the
country

00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
we we talked about educational
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity right we talked we've talked
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
about it for years and we we've nipped
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
around the edges here and there we've
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
done some really good things with
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity but this year
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
for the first time in our state's
 
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
for the first time in our state's
history

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
a child's zip code and their family's
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
income no longer determine their
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
our education savings accounts
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
are providing opportunity not just to a
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
couple hundred but thousands of families
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
a concept an idea and an opportunity
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
they never even imagined that they would
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
they would ever have and again we didn't
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
just talk about it we found a way to do
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
it we got it done and an unprecedented
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
number of families are taking advantage
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
of it with nothing but successful
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
results we've always we talked about
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
prioritizing cutting taxes attracting
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
businesses so you cut them and you cut
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
them and then we cut them again
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
now we know we have one of the lowest
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
tax burdens in our in the country all
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
while still delivering some of the most
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
robust services in the country in fact
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is ranked number one in
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
the country for the dollars into the
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
system compared to what you get out we
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
get a better rate of return for our tax
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
dollars than anywhere else and so while
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
you cut taxes you create financial
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity and you can still deliver on
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
the obligations that you have to from a
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
government perspective
 
00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:26.390 align:start position:0%
government perspective
and

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
again we talk about people taking notice
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
how do i know we have the fastest
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
population growth in the northeast that
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in a long time
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
businesses are absolutely pouring in
 
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.829 align:start position:0%
businesses are absolutely pouring in
here

00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
and we have the largest state surplus in
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
the state's history the tax cuts work
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know here's one that we haven't
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
talked about lately back in 2016
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
remember new hampshire had some of the
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
highest health care costs in the country
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
it was a real issue the fact that we
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
were kind of up here in the northeast
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
some of the highest health care costs in
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
the country and we didn't just accept it
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
we set out to change it so we changed
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
certain regulatory barriers at the state
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
level we changed certain policies and
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
what's the result this year we have the
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
lowest benchmark health insurance
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
premiums in new england and we are now
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
below the national average in terms of
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance and health costs you
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues that we talk a lot
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
about is mental health right
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is a national issue i frankly i
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a worldwide issue
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
and we continue to take that challenge
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
head on
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
when i came into office the state had a
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
mental health system that was fragmented
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
it was designed by bureaucrats it didn't
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
work for families and we called it the
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
unspoken crisis of our time and
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that had only been
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the coveted pandemic
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
it was no accident when i decided to
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
choose for my commissioner of health and
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
human services a nurse
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that had worked her way up through the
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
long term care system that had managed
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of folks obviously they see
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
her on tv with me a lot of folks have
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
gotten to know commissioner shibanen
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
but working with her and her team
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
we set out to dramatically transform the
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
entire mental health system not just a
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
piece of it here not just put a little
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
more money in there but really transform
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
the system to acknowledge that it is
 
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.589 align:start position:0%
the system to acknowledge that it is
2022

00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
and to do things like it's 1985 doesn't
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
make any sense and it doesn't deliver
 
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.390 align:start position:0%
make any sense and it doesn't deliver
results

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and as we came through last year's covet
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
emergency order i immediately issued
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
another executive order if you remember
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
and we just simply called on direct
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
action to ensure that individuals in the
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis especially kids
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
receive timely and appropriate medical
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
medical care simple statement something
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
everybody can agree on but you can't
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
just have a blue ribbon commission you
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
can't just write an executive order and
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
tuck it away
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
in a drawer somewhere
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
so a key piece of that transformation
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
effort as a lot of us know is to
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
increase capacity in our community based
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
services getting your services getting
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
your mental health supports getting a
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
lot of your health care supports in your
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
community is simply a better way to do
 
00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:08.710 align:start position:0%
community is simply a better way to do
it

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that provide means providing access
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
to mental health care for children and
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
families before they find themselves in
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
the crisis before they walk in to have
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
to walk into that emergency room
 
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.630 align:start position:0%
to walk into that emergency room
so

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
let's talk about a couple of our
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
successes and i think they set a model
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
for where we go as a lot of folks know
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
we recently signed a purchase and sales
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
agreement to buy hampstead hospital it's
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
a transformational investment to provide
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated services specifically for new
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire's kids who need and deserve
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
access to high quality mental health
 
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:47.430 align:start position:0%
access to high quality mental health
providers

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
last month
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
last just last month we doubled down our
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
on our emergency on-demand access to
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
mental health so when you're in a crisis
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have time to wait
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
it isn't something that you want to
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
study we need the middle
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
middle of a mental health crisis we
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
should be asking people to google where
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
to find supports so now we have our
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
mobile prices support a 24 7 crisis call
 
00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:09.589 align:start position:0%
mobile prices support a 24 7 crisis call
center

00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
over the last year we invested millions
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
to promote youth activities as well not
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
just what we do in the classroom we have
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
great social emotional learning programs
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
in the classroom we're working with kids
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
to understand some of the
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
pressures that can be on them and on the
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
system and how to work that we're doing
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
it through our summer camp programs
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom with kids
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
something that we had never even tried
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
before but had tremendous success with
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm calling on the house and senate
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
today while i got you i got a captive
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
audience right
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
so we've made great progress
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
sb 234 it's something that i find so
 
00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.510 align:start position:0%
sb 234 it's something that i find so
simple

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
but i think it's actually a brilliant
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
idea and sometimes the best ideas can
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
can come in the simplest ways it simply
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
requires that every student id in new
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire have the phone number to the
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention lifeline a
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
24 7 emergency service that is now in
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
the pocket of every kid with access to
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
every family member it's so simple it
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
costs nothing but will undoubtedly save
 
00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
costs nothing but will undoubtedly save
lives

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
but we're not done
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
not by any means
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the next few weeks commissioner
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
shibane and i will be bringing forward a
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
history another i think historic
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a public private
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a public private
partnership

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
that will for the first time provide new
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire with an adequate number of
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
crisis beds for those who are most in
 
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:32.069 align:start position:0%
crisis beds for those who are most in
need

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
making investments in two brand new
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
mental health hospitals in this state
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
will have a profound effect not just
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
creating access to the beds but also by
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
opening the door
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
and getting a level of workforce that
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've never seen in mental health a
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
level of specialization that we need
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
here in the state we now become one of
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
the most attractive places on the east
 
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.789 align:start position:0%
the most attractive places on the east
coast

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
coast
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
for mental health workers for that
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
workforce for new programs and new ideas
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
and these investments are going to be
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
coming i hope to get everybody's support
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not done
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
just because we're investing in these
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
new hospitals we're taking better
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
community services we're making it a
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
little easier for someone in that moment
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
of prices in their home to access help
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
we can't just rest on that
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot more ideas
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
that come to the table every one of
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
those ideas has to be put on that table
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
every one of those ideas has to be
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
listened to because whatever we design
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
and invest in today we can't do what we
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
did three decades ago make fundamental
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
change and then just kind of rest on our
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
laurels sit back go on to the next thing
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
the mental health challenges that our
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
country and our state are going to face
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be here for some time the
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
doors are open it's a community solution
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's a 10-year mental health plan that
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
was designed by families not bureaucrats
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
think about that for a second right
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't just have bureaucrats right we
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
ran the families to do it that was hard
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of hard work but allowing
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
those ideas to come on the table opened
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
our eyes to a world of opportunity
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
problems challenges we're taking them
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
head on
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to do and all i ask is
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
what i think everybody in this room can
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
agree can agree with that when it comes
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
to mental health we have the chance
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
now just a few years ago alongside with
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
the mental health crisis we saw
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
daily news stories we saw the data and
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
we saw that new hampshire we're seeing
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
drug related deaths continue to
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
skyrocket from 2013 to 2017 the numbers
 
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.990 align:start position:0%
skyrocket from 2013 to 2017 the numbers
were

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
going crazy looked like going up the
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
front side of cannon mountain i mean the
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
numbers were just unbelievable and every
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
day we kept hearing those stories
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
our drug related deaths in that time
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
period doubled
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
when i became governor i think we said
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
enough is enough and instead of just
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
pumping more money frankly into a
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
failing system with little
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
accountability we took the challenge
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
head-on and again we said we're going to
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
build a new system a system that
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
actually achieves results
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we have it up and running today it's
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
called the doorways
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it does it's a system that didn't
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
just focus on 28 days of treatment
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
goodbye good luck
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
that was literally how we treated a lot
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the individuals who are suffering
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
through this crisis
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
but the doorways
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
is an integrated system it takes all of
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
those wrap around services that are
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
critical for long the long-term success
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
not just a 28-day success but the
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
long-term success of that individual and
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
that family
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
treatment recovery transitional housing
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
recovery friendly workplaces harm
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
reduction prevention all of that is now
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
wrapped into a continuum
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we put it all across the state
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
now we have access to 24 7 services in
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
this area now just because you live up
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
in co-ops or grafton we're not asking
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
folks to drive 200 miles to get a
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
service that frankly should be in their
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
backyard we're delivering those services
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
when they want them
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
how they want them and where they are
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and thanks to the doorway and frankly
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
the incredible men and women also that
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
are working in that system
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
to support it
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
in 2021 new hampshire became one of the
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
only states in america where overdose
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
deaths did not increase
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
in fact over the last two years
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
we've reduced drug overdose deaths by
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent while the rest of
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
the country has gone up 50 percent we
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
look we haven't won the battle we know
 
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.349 align:start position:0%
look we haven't won the battle we know
this

00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
nearly 400 people still lost their lives
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
to drug overdose deaths last year we are
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
not we have not won the battle by far
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
but the tools and resources that we have
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
deployed citizens can rest assured again
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
that we're simply just leaving no stone
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
unturned we're challenging ourselves to
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
do things a little differently and we're
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
demanding that we get results from those
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
systems now we talk a lot about mental
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
health we're talking a lot about opioids
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
but a lot of folks lately are also
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
talking one of the big words of the
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
day's infrastructure
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
governor that you know great services is
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
important but i live in a rural
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
community what are you going to do about
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
broadband i live in a community
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
with contaminated groundwater my well is
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated right what are we doing for
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure of the state because
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
that making those investments ensures
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we're not just solving a problem
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
for the next five or ten but literally
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
the next hundred years potentially for
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
what might come
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
so during covet in 2020 we were one of
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
the only states to make broadband
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
investments this was a really amazing
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
process i didn't i wasn't even sure if
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
we could get it done but using some of
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
the cares act money we delivered new
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
high-speed broadband
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
to about 4 500 families all across the
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
state and we did it in just a couple
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
months and because of that model because
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
we were so aggressive about it back then
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
now that these new dollars are being
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
made available through arp and the
 
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:37.030 align:start position:0%
made available through arp and the
infrastructure

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
we are one of the we're going to be one
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the first states because we're just
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
kind of copying and duplicating the
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
model that we had that worked so
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
successfully we're now going to be one
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the first states to deliver
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
high-speed broadband to tens of
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
thousands of more individuals over the
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
next couple years a huge huge
 
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:59.109 align:start position:0%
next couple years a huge huge
opportunity

00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we continue to make big investments
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
to address pfas contamination in our
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
water system look i was an environmental
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
engineer right this is what i did i used
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
to drill those wells and sample that
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated water it was chlorinated
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
solvents that was one of my specialties
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
and i can say without a doubt that the
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
pfas groundwater contamination issue
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state is one of the
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
biggest environmental concerns that the
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
i see chuck over here i'm going to do it
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
on chuck a little bit
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
it takes leadership to really get this
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
stuff done
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
when i first became governor i don't
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
even think i was inaugurated yet i think
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is right
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think maybe it was in december
 
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
i think maybe it was in december
and

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
at the time senate president morse came
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
to me and started talking about this
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
concept they had about a fund and the
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
fact we could take some of the money we
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
had gotten from a large settlement and
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
create a fund and we knew that would
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
kind of just scratch the surface and we
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
said gee how many towns could we get to
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it was a lot there's a lot you can
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
do with a couple hundred million dollars
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
to be sure but as over time we've seen
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
the need grow and we didn't say well
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's just it we put a bunch of money
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
in there good luck goodbye and good luck
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
we continue to make those investments in
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
just the last year we made another 150
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
million dollar of investments with
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
senator morris's leadership using some
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
of the federal supports we have using
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
some of our local dollars and again
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
that this crisis that we do have for a
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
lot of families there are a lot of
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
families out there still drinking
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
bottled water all the time because they
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't have access
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
but we're not settling on that senator
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
morse is driving forward
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in new
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
investments we're taking that challenge
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
head on and again it's not something
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to solve it today but also
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
for the next 20 and 50 years so thank
 
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:34.810 align:start position:0%
you senator morris
 
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:40.390 align:start position:0%
you senator morris
[Applause]

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
you know people talk about inflation
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is another one i actually got a
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
call this morning someone said why are
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
you lowering why aren't you solving
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
inflation governor
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
look i get the sentiment we're all
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
feeling it right
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
especially low-income families inflation
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
is the worst tax you can possibly put
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
upon a low-income family
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
they have to put gas in their tank just
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
as much as anybody else
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
so do not address that at the national
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
level there's only so much we know we
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
can do at the state level but i think we
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
put some innovative stuff in there
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
but to not address that at the national
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
level to not address the fact that fuel
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
costs are skyrocketing and in a place
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire people have to heat
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
have you seen some of the fuel oil bills
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
coming to your constituents lately it's
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
out of control
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
is there any sense that washington is
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
addressing the fuel issue that is
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
addressing the inflationary pressures on
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
our system no
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
now that's where i think the new
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire stepped up and said we're
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
going to cut taxes we're going to take
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
financial burdens off of our citizens
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do what we can to offset
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
we know that the increasing those costs
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
and when we see those costs skyrocketing
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
it hurts our job creators our families
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
seniors seniors on fixed incomes right
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
they have to feel that heating that oil
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
that inflationary pressure as much as
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i think what we've seen over the past
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
year it reinforces a philosophy on
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
energy in particular that i try to
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
always bring to the table first and
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
foremost we have to prioritize our
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and we have to make sure our
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
policy decisions
 
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.789 align:start position:0%
policy decisions
don't

01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
unduly overburden them
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
and when possible we want to strive to
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire solutions that are
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
innovative and also responsible
 
01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
innovative and also responsible
so

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
having a more of a methodical way of
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
addressing energy policy in new
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire over the past few years has
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
proven to be inc i think incredibly
 
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.510 align:start position:0%
proven to be inc i think incredibly
successful

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
over the last five years i did i just
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
saw the statistic over the last five
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
years the increase in energy costs for
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.349 align:start position:0%
years the increase in energy costs for
massachusetts

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
double that of new hampshire that's
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
pretty incredible let me say that a
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
different way if we had just done what
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts did with all of their
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
projects saying yes to everything across
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
the table an extra hundred million
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
dollars of burden would have been placed
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
on our again our low income families our
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
senior citizens they would have to pay
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
another 100 million dollars just to turn
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
on the light switch
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's wrong
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
so we took a step back and we knew we
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
weren't going to go down a path blindly
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
we can be very we can be much smarter we
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
stepped up we did we established a
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that i i noticed is
 
01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that i i noticed is
that

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
when i looked at historically what was
 
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.589 align:start position:0%
when i looked at historically what was
happening

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
every project that came across
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
individuals desks were just funded
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
right the lobbyists would get involved
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
the special interests would get involved
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
oh just fund it just fund it we don't
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
want to take the political hit
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
the political win is standing up for
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
your citizens who have to pay those
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
bills every single month right
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
and so we said we can still be smart
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
about how we do renewable energy we
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
fought hard to do solar panels and solar
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
projects but you know what let's put
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
them on the low-income families
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
locations first right maybe their inner
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
city locations maybe their mobile home
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
parks maybe their senior citizens homes
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
we all get the environmental benefit but
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
let let's let those who have the least
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill amount of
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
least amount of possibility to pay those
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
high burdens
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's let those be the first of the
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
trough to get the financial benefits
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
when we do that
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's just very strategic as opposed to
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a little bit of
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
everything everywhere
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
offshore wind i'm incredibly proud that
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
again we finally established this office
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
for offshore wind industry and
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
development because we can do it in a
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
very responsible way clean reliable
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
offshore wind will be a reality here in
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire no doubt
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
you might not be able to see it it's
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be way off the coast but i
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
guarantee you we're all going to get the
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
benefits of that and we didn't just run
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
that run through the door first right we
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
saw how some of these other projects are
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
playing out we saw how some of those
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
costs are being managed
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
and my point in all this is is just
 
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
and my point in all this is is just
saying

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're finding smarter ways to do things
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
right we had the net metering battle
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
going on in the legislature in our
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
office for a couple years
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
but last year we found a way to bring
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
folks together find a compromise move
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
forward on net metering with clean
 
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.990 align:start position:0%
forward on net metering with clean
energy

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
with more solar power and letting the
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
cities and towns actually dictate their
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
energy future for themselves a huge huge
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
win i'm seeing i see michael vos out
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
there senator avar a lot of folks really
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
came together to make that happen thank
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
you know a couple years ago i'm not sure
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
which speech it was i think i was i was
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
before the legislature i'm not sure
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
which which time but
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i said was that
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
you know those of us that are born here
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're lucky and those
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
that move here are smart
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a lot of really smart
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
people moving into new hampshire right
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
because we're seeing this real
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
population boom that we haven't seen in
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
a long long time
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
but they are families that are coming
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
here and businesses that are coming here
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
for a specific reason right they didn't
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
just throw a dart on them on a map and
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
say well maybe new hampshire will be
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay they're very strategically said
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's where i want to be and they're
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
coming out of california they're coming
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
out of nevada they're coming out of new
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
york in new jersey in michigan minnesota
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
but these are families that are looking
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
for low taxes they're looking for good
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
schools they're looking for a sense of
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
community they're looking for that
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
quality of life and living that we talk
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
about with the mountains and the lakes
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the rivers and the oceans
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
and when you look in when you look at
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunities that we provide
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
there's no place that people want to
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
want to be more in the northeast than
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
right here in new hampshire so that
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
presents opportunities and challenges to
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
be sure and so one of our biggest
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
challenges that we are seeing that we
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
talk about almost on a daily basis now
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
is the availability of housing for
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
working families
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
our state shortage of available housing
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
was further squeezed by the pandemic
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
everyone started pouring in
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
we can just harp on the challenge or we
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
can say where's the opportunity right
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
where's the opportunity again to make
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
the right investments the right
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes invest in the
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure not just for tomorrow but
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
really for the long term i created the
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing the council on housing stability
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
in november of 2020 and that council
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
really designed kind of a three-year
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
plan it aims to reduce homelessness and
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
really attack the homelessness issue
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
which we see rampant all across this
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
country but we have our issues here as
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
well we can't ignore that
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
it really aims to increase housing units
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
for working families by over thirteen
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
thousand units in the next three years
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
which sounds like a lot but it is
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
achievable is an achievable goal
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
that is within our grasp
 
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
that is within our grasp
so

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'll continue to ask the legislature i
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
know it got put on hold but we have sb
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
400 a bill that senator bradley hey jeff
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
how are you senator bradley really
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
champion sb 400 really creates some
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory flexibilities and some
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
incentives at the local level to really
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
move things forward because that's where
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
we see things stalling out but we know
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
that sb 400 just won't be enough
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
i've repeatedly asked the federal
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
government right we have this rental
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
relief money that comes in and mortgage
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
relief money that is coming in and i've
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
asked the federal government multiple
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
times can you give us some flexibility
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
those things might be super important
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
top priority in other parts of the
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
country it's important here to be sure
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
but let us take some of those funds that
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
are currently being unused and find ways
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
to create actual more housing right you
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
want to solve the housing crime in new
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire bricks and mort are creating
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
more they said no the federal government
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
won't give any more flexibility on any
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
of those funds
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not deterred i don't think anybody
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
should be turd frankly
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we know that we do have to make an
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
investment today we know that we can
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
move forward create more of that
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
workforce housing but just as important
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
do so in a way
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
this is the important part in a way that
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
really preserves who we are in our
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
communities what we're about whether
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's in the small towns or our largest
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
cities preserve everything we are as
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
granite staters and we have a shared
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to our neighbors and to
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
our businesses that are relying on the
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
housing to get the workforce so that
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
they can keep growing here and taking
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of all the opportunity that
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're creating for them
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is the way we do it in new
 
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.390 align:start position:0%
this is the way we do it in new
hampshire

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
now today because we've had so much
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
financial success
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm proposing the invest nh housing
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
incentive fund
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
a historic 100 million dollar fund using
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
our dollars to rebuild and expand
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
housing for our next generation so it's
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
a multi-tiered approach
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
let me walk you through it
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
first step
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
my proposal will invest 60 million
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in flexible grants to match
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
investments for multi-family housing
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
projects already ready already to ready
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
to move and getting in into the building
 
01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:27.669 align:start position:0%
to move and getting in into the building
stages

01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
stages
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that we know we
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
have is slow or uncertain permitting at
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
the local level that happens a lot so i
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
want to incentivize towns right not with
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
the stick we do things in new hampshire
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the carrot we want to incentivize
 
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
with the carrot we want to incentivize
them

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
so with this plan i'm calling for a 30
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar commitment to reward
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that can approve permits
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
within six months of application those
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
grants will be made directly to the
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
towns to offset the costs that they may
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
see and increase their ability to invest
 
01:10:56.159 --> 01:10:57.669 align:start position:0%
see and increase their ability to invest
locally

01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
locally
 
01:10:57.679 --> 01:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
locally
third

01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
i want to create this is a little bit of
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
interesting one something i heard all
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
across the state a five million dollar
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
demolition fund
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
we found all these projects across the
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
state that weren't moving forward
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
because we had dilapidated housing often
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the 20s or 30s or 40s the cost to
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
remove that housing or do the
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
environmental cleanup for those projects
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
was too much so the developer wouldn't
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
do it the town wouldn't do it so they
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
wanted the town or city might want new
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
housing to move in
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
but you had this dilapidated housing
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
that was frankly an environmental
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
problem a plight it lowered property
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
values and inhibited that development
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
growth that we want to see so a 5
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
million demolition grant fund for those
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities to help match some of the
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
costs and offset some of the costs that
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
they might have to really clear away for
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
new sustainable well-designed well-built
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
housing and finally i want to invest
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
directly into the cities and towns by
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
providing five million dollars in
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
planning grants and zoning grants so
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
many towns are looking for the
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
assistance to update their planning and
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
zoning laws we have towns that haven't
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
changed zoning and planning laws in 40
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
years here right they have to bring in a
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
consultant it might take some cost they
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't have that money for whatever
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
reason so let's create a fund again to
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
help them at the local level move their
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
process a little faster a little further
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
along that brings more again attracts
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
more investment brings more developers
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
in and ultimately gets it done these
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
investments are critical they are
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical in ensuring that new
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire continues to be the number one
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
destination in new england the housing
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
is for workers they are for families
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're for those who contribute to our
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
community they go to our schools they
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
boom our economy and so the data is very
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
clear housing creates regional
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
stabilities for families and businesses
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a win that i'm hoping the
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
so back in 2020
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we took an aggressive
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
approach i think in the right approach
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
in tackling issues surrounding law
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountability
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
our correctional reforms modernizing our
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
detention systems
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
we ensure that law enforcement work in
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
conjunction with community leaders to
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
develop our commission on law
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountability we call it
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
lee act
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement remains
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
the gold standard across the country
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
they it really does from the very local
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
level in the small towns working
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
seamlessly with the state police with
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
our federal partners
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
in fact our system is so good working so
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
seamlessly not just building up fiefdoms
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
but working together as a team
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we are out teaching other states
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
how to do it we're working across the
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
borders in maine and vermont and
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts right
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
so knowing that we were able to do that
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
gave us the opportunity to really take
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
on some of the challenges and do it
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
together right and do it in a very
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
the leak commission that we put together
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
was able to move forward on a lot of the
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives and a lot of the the ideas
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
that they had some were at police
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
standard in training some happened right
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature some we could do
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
with executive order some required
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
funding some were as simple as you know
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
body cams for our cops and somewhere
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
more advanced is how we're going to
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
train and teach and work with law
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a seamless way right
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
state local and federal
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
but we also looked very aggressively and
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
this legislature deserves a lot of
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
credit looked very aggressively
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
at our correction system designed for
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
for youth for our kids
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
after years of inaction
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
we brought from the shadows the horrific
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
cases of abuse that occurred at new
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire's youth detention facility in
 
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire's youth detention facility in
manchester

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office continues
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive criminal investigation
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
into these these allegations and while
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the abuse may occur many years or even
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think i speak for everyone in here
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
when i say that we are not going to stop
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
until we've brought all those
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
to that end working with the attorney
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
general i know he's brought to this
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
legislature a proposal to set a hundred
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar settlement fund for
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
compensating these victims it's the
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
sensible thing to do it's the right
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
thing to do i hope you'll support me in
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
creating the fund so we can bring
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
closure to what has been an incredible
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
pain incredibly painful process we got
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
to move the current group of kids
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
right we can't forget we still have kids
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
in that facility today
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
and again we got to make sure that we're
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
providing not just the security around
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
those children but a model that works
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
for them a 21st century thinking model
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
and so bringing those group of kids to
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
more of a treatment focused model
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then frankly bulldoze that
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
i won't use a swear word
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
bulldoze that darn building to the
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
ground once and for all in the city of
 
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
ground once and for all in the city of
manchester

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's the opportunity i see community
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
based services treatment based services
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to move beyond a
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
failed system of the past we're going to
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
write what we need to write and we're
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
designing for the future in a way that
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
can be more sustainable and create a
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
better product for all of us
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
so despite our ranking as the number one
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
state in public safety in the united
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
states we obviously know that there is
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
still a lot more to do to keep
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
communities safe that's always a
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
challenge that we need to take on i was
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
very grateful i
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
saw just yesterday the senate passed sb
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
294 that will ensure violent criminals
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
i mean who doesn't want to who wants to
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
see a violent criminal walk free on bail
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how everyone in this room
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
isn't standing up for that frankly
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's critical in protecting victims of
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence attackers should be
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
able just to walk right out and prey on
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
their victims once again and this
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislature is standing up and doing
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
something about it so at a time when law
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement across the country they are
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
faced with unspeakable danger we have to
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
continue and stand up for a system that
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
prioritizes safe communities above all
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
else with that gold standard for public
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
safety sb 294 will make us safer do
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
whatever you can get that bill to my
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
desk so we can get it done thank you
 
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
desk so we can get it done thank you
guys

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to close
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
i know it was longer than y'all thought
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
longer than i thought i apologize a lot
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
of good stuff i'm excited but i want to
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
close with a really exciting opportunity
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
and a project
 
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.630 align:start position:0%
and a project
um

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's honestly the last project we're
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to do but the last one i'll i'll
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
kind of push here because i think it's
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's a incredible opportunity one area
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
that i think we are all passionate about
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh is supporting our veterans right and
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
our active military service members we
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
do a great job of that here in new
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire can always do more to be sure
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
but we we always make sure that that is
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the front of our mindset this past
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
year we opened a new state-of-the-art uh
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
homeless facilities uh for our veterans
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
for struggling veterans we know we can
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
do more um i want to talk about a
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
project that i think thinks a little
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
bigger a little broader a little more
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
encompassing and a little more 21st
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
century in terms of what our obligation
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
our responsibility is to deliver for
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
those individuals those heroes that
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
stand up for the united states of
 
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.430 align:start position:0%
stand up for the united states of
america

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
america
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of new hampshire citizens have
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
answered that call to service it's a
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
proud legacy in our state
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh something that we're all eternally
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
grateful for but over the past few
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
months i've been working with attendant
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
general david mikulitis
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
led to some folks in legislative
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
leadership um
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
some folks with our veterans support
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
groups around the state on a proposal
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
that takes advantage of an opportunity
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
and a partnership with easter seals a
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
great non-profit group that does a lot
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
of different things here in new
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire this 21 million dollar
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
initiative will create a you very unique
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing veterans campus
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and so the veterans campus is being
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
proposed for a site up in franklin new
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's designed to really
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
integrate veterans
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
active military their families a campus
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
that includes housing support services a
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%

veterans and military personnel
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that with this project
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward like never before new
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to be that gold
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
standard i keep using that term but that
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
gold standard as we should be for those
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
who have stood up for us uh so bravely
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
across this country but designing a
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
campus that integrates all of these
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
amazing services because at the end of
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
the day it's about the health and
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
wellness of american heroes
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to push out a lot of more
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
details and information it's a project
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's moving along very aggressively
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope the legislature will find a
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
we have had a lot of success over the
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
last year there's no doubt about it even
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
with all the challenges we face and a
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
lot more opportunity ahead of us let's
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
not take any of our progress for granted
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
as they say we don't just rest on our
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
laurels of success you got to keep
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
driving forward and keep putting new
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
ideas on the table
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
now too often we see it on the national
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
level especially we see folks really in
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
this country fighting in the extremes we
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
see idle ideological differences that
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
can bring great ideas to a screeching
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
halt and sometimes it's all over some
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
political turf battle more than anything
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
we can't let that happen here in new
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a state we're moving full
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
speed ahead but we can't get bogged down
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
or disrupted by those extremes and we
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
have to have the courage to reject a lot
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
of those notions
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
the citizens of this state did not hire
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
us just to be political ideologues they
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
hired us to do a job they hired us to
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
get results
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and frankly if you're here to get
 
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.149 align:start position:0%
and frankly if you're here to get
attention

01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
over the fight that frankly gets us
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
nowhere i don't think any of us have any
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
patience for that
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
never and i will never let our process
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
and our opportunity
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
be hijacked by radical radical elements
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
on either side of the aisle this is new
 
01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:25.750 align:start position:0%
on either side of the aisle this is new
hampshire

every day i don't see anybody trying to
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%

let's not let social media dictate our
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
priorities or our sentiments
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's not really real i think a lot of us
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
know that let's not fixate on cable news
 
01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:47.550 align:start position:0%

about the
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
prison system i want to touch on that a
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
little bit we have a crisis in new
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people are not aware of at
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
this point in time only 50 percent 50
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
percent of the positions in the state
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
prison system are staffed
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're using national guard troops
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
in our prison in the state of new
 
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.470 align:start position:0%

hampshire

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
we've had some interesting things occur
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony in committee from a
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
female corrections officer who has been
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
forced in this past year to work 100
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
hour weeks on mandatory overtime
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
she's worked for the state for quite a
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
she's had enough so she went over and
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
talked to the retirement system
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system said
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for working 100 hour work
 
01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you for working 100 hour work
weeks

01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
this past year but none of that's gonna
 
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.950 align:start position:0%
this past year but none of that's gonna
count

01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
she was taken aback as most of you would
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
think you would be as you paid in from
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
your paycheck
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
over that time period
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
to then have the retirement system say
 
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.350 align:start position:0%
to then have the retirement system say
sorry

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
that year that you sacrifice doesn't
 
01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:19.350 align:start position:0%
that year that you sacrifice doesn't
count

01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
and what we learned in committee in
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
consultation with the retirement system
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
was that in fact money was being taken
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
from her paycheck based on her income
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
and not counting towards her pension
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
calculation but going into the general
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
re retirement fund
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
i tell you this if money is taken from
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
someone's paycheck and placed in any
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a general type fund that is an
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
by its very definition
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the private sector does an
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
investment require you to pay for five
 
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
investment require you to pay for five
years

01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then not count your contributions
 
01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:58.350 align:start position:0%
to your investment portfolio
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
to your investment portfolio

mr speaker mr speaker c3 i had a
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
question for the previous speaker
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to a question
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
mr speaker okay
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr speaker
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative santo nostasso uh mr
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
speaker currently in statute final
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
compensation calculation for all new
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirees is the same
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
this bill unfairly increases the final
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
compensation just for group two retirees
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
and leaves group one the way it is this
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
is because the cost group to include
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
group one would be too expensive
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
instead of increasing retirement
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
benefits for one class of retirees we
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
should work on a solution that is fair
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
to both
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill the problem will
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
return as group one retirees demand the
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
same benefit
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
since the cost is too high the
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislator will be unable to give them
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
the same benefit putting us in a corner
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
to explain why group 1 doesn't deserve
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
the same calculation or walk back the
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to group 2.
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
the retirement system is already dealing
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
with a six billion dollar unfunded
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
liability if we're going to use the
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
general fund for retirement system we
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
should consider stopping the bleeding
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
before adding this additional ongoing
 
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
before adding this additional ongoing
liability

01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
this bill leaves the open question on
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
the possibility of gaming the retirement
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
system sometimes to refer to as pension
 
01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.629 align:start position:0%
system sometimes to refer to as pension
spiking

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
spiking
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
this would be some sort of scheme where
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
an employee gains his wages in such a
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
way that earns him a retirement greater
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
than intended
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
lastly to suggest we need this nuanced
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
change in the way the retirement benefit
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
is calculated to retain and recruit
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
public workers is ridiculous the labor
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
shortage is a universal problem over the
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
entire economy regardless of what the
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit provided if it was
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
the case that the labor shortage was
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
correlated with retirement package then
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
maybe this argument would be sound
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking to vote no on house bill
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
1587 and mr speaker i asked for a

a true representation of what they've
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
paid into the system
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%

so

01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
a question for the
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
speaker what's the reason to memorize
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
a question about the uh process for
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
so this is a two committee bill it's
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
going to go on to finance after this if
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
members might support the bill but have
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about the cost
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
does the finance committee have the
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
power to reduce the total cost amount on
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right yeah i couldn't hear your
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative the finance committee
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
will obviously have deliberations on
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
this bill that if it passes that's where
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
it will go
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%

01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
know that this favors one class of
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
retiree over another
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we are creating an
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for pension spiking
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
and if i know this adds a larger
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
liability to the retirement system
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know the labor is a universal
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
problem and not just isolated public
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
workers then would i press the red
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
button so another motion could be made
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%

01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%

01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
tell you it doesn't count
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
if i know taking money based on income
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
at the rate 11.55 to 11.8 and not apply
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
it towards the final income calculation
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
is an income tax
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%

more beds
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%

biggest crises is the number of hospital

because of those current rules would i
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
know that this is something that can
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
wait into a later date when we know the
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%

children in this state
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
and if we know
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
that preventative services
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
and adequate health care
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
is an investment that
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
saves us money and reduces the use of
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
critical emergency services and
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
in-hospital beds long term
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%

these benefits
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the very newest of our citizens would
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
i now vote red on the tabling motion
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the representative
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%

you mr speaker
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
if i knew that refugees already have
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
access to medicaid coverage
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that while this bill
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
states that it is for legal immigrants
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
testimony in committee spoke almost
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
exclusively to the need of those who
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
came into compliance with the law
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%

only after being detained for their
status

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that states who have
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
extended this generosity on the backs of
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers are facing insolvency
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore are losing the ability to
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
help anyone would i then press the green
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
button to table this bill
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%

hb 1604 would repeal that exemption

not conflict with that cms mandate
 
02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.709 align:start position:0%
not conflict with that cms mandate
now

02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would appear to solve a conflict
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it really doesn't because the
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment also mandates that such
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
facilities shall automatically
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
upon request
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
grant an exemption for vaccination to
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
any person who simply requests an
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
exemption for medical religious or

conscientious objection
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is in conflict with the rules
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
promulgated by cms with regard to the
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccination mandate which
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
requires documentation of the medical

requires documentation of the medical
reason

02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
for the medical exemption
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
signed by a licensed practitioner
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
documentation of religious exemptions
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
and does not
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow conscientious objection as an
 
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.030 align:start position:0%
allow conscientious objection as an
exemption

02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
this would place our facilities out of
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
compliance with the cms mandate and at
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
risk of civil penalties
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
loss of reimbursement for medicare and
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid patients and ultimately
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
termination from the medicare and
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid programs
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
remember medicaid pays the bill for
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of our nursing home residents
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
and also since compliance with federal
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
regulation is required for accreditation
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
facilities lack of compliance with the
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
mandate will also lead to loss of
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation and therefore risk of
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
losing payment
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
from private insurers as well
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire would then
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
need to backfill that revenue loss in
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
order to keep those facilities running
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
starting with at least the 200 million
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
dollars which annually which is the
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
federal share of medicaid funding for
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
long-term care in new hampshire alone
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
now the majority has claimed that cms
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
will not stop the reimbursement as it
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
has not happened in other states who
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
have put similar laws in place
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
but that is not any guarantee as the
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
mandate is new and enforcement actions
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
have not commenced yet
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates in the health care
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
setting are crucial and they are common
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
even though transmission can still occur
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
with a breakthrough coveted infection
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated workers will still have a far
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
lower rate of infection so the risk of
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
transmission to a patient on the
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
aggregate at the population level
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
will be diminished with vaccination
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
and since hospitals and long-term care
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
facilities care for vulnerable
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
individuals they must do everything they
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
can to maintain safety and that includes
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable expectation
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
of a patient or a resident in a nursing
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
home from the health care from
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary exposure to an infectious
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease from the health care
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
worker who cares for them
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
the us supreme court ruling on january
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
13 2022 upheld the cms mandate for
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination of health care workers
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
staying the lower court injunction
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee discounts
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
this as quote just to stay end quote but
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
that text to the supreme court decision
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
makes it clear
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
that they support the cms vaccine
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
mandate saying quote we accordingly
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
conclude that the secretary did not
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
exceed his statutory authority in
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
requiring that in order to remain
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for medicare and medicaid
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
dollars the facilities covered by the
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
interim rule must ensure that their
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
employees be vaccinated against covet 19
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear that if the lower
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
court decision ultimately makes it to
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
the supreme court on appeal that they
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
will uphold the mandate and to date no
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
appeal of the lower court injunction has
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
been filed in summary
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
both the bill has introduced and the
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
amendment placed us out of compliance

with the cms vaccination mandate with
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%

02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
complied with the vaccine mandates today
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony of one facility
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
where only 87
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the health care staff
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
had confirmed vaccination status
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
so we may be losing 13
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the staff if we don't provide
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.189 align:start position:0%
an opportunity

02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
you might question how the safety has
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
been if there's 13 percent of the
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
employees who either are unvaccinated or
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
unwilling to disclose their status

glencliff home went over a year without
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
a case of covet
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
our nursing homes county nursing homes
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
are doing a phenomenal job
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
the system is working well
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
and providing these exemptions will
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
allow our health care system to continue
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
to function well
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
now we have the question about the right
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
of conscience
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
when we look to our constitution in
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
article four part one
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
it talks about those rights that are
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
unalienable which cannot be traded away
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
or given away because there is no
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
fair trade for those rights
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
and among those is the right of
 
02:08:12.639 --> 02:08:14.310 align:start position:0%
and among those is the right of
conscience

02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
we speak to our religious freedom in the
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
constitution in article five of part one
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
we may or may not know that that freedom
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
to practice religion is based upon one's
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
own conscience and reason
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
the right of religion includes the right
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
of conscience i believe that that is a
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
very strong case
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that this is within
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
our rights and our duties to protect our
 
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.109 align:start position:0%
our rights and our duties to protect our
staff

02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
from having to make a choice that they
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
may not be comfortable doing and to
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
protect our patients by keeping staffing
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
levels appropriate
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is a solution
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
i ask for you to vote in favor of this
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.629 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be

02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the amendment

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.550 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes representative
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the united states supreme court has
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
already rendered an opinion
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
that clearly supports the cms mandate
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccination of health care
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
workers and institutions which receive
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from medicaid and medicare
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb1604 is amended
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
would place the state of new hampshire
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the rules of the cms
 
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the rules of the cms
mandate

02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the healthcare workforce shortage
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
has been present for a number of years
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
prior to covet 19
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that health care facilities which
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
have imposed vaccine mandates have had
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
nearly complete compliance
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
rather than mass resignation
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that lack of compliance
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
with this mandate may lead to loss of
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
accreditation of our institutions loss
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
of medicare and medicaid reimbursement
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
leading to the need for state of new
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire to backfill hundreds of
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars in funding to keep our
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and hospitals open
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
would i then vote no with the red button
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
on the

media reports the supreme court did not
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
make a ruling
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
it gave an opinion which has far less
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
weight and suggests that this is still
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
in play

thank you mr speaker as i already noted
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
hb 1604 is an amendment amended would
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
place our facilities out of compliance
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
with the cms covet 19 vaccination
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
mandate for health care workers which
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
work in facilities that receive medicare
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
or medicaid funds
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and at risk of civil penalties loss of
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for medicare and medicaid
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
patients and ultimately termination from
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the medicare and medicaid programs
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
we have seen that when
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates were placed in
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
various places such as at dartmouth that
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rate skyrocketed we did
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
not see mass resignation
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
lack of compliance with the cms mandate
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
will lead to loss of accreditation to
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
facilities as well and therefore the
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
risk of losing payment from private
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
insurers as well
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
this loss of reimbursement is going to
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
require the state of new hampshire to
 
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
backfill hundreds of millions of dollars
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
in funding to keep our hospitals and
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
nursing homes open are we really
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates in the healthcare
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
setting are crucial common and
 
02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
setting are crucial common and
responsible

02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
since hospitals and long-term care
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
facilities care for vulnerable
 
02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.069 align:start position:0%
facilities care for vulnerable
individuals

02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
they must do everything they can to
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
maintain safety
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that includes a reasonable
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
expectation of a patient or resident not
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
to face
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary exposure to an infectious
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease from the health care
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
worker who is caring for them
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court has upheld the cms
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
mandate for vaccination of health care
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
workers stay in that lower court
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
decision and again the text of the
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision makes it clear
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
they support the cms mandate
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with that at our peril
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
so please vote no with the red button on
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass with
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
amendment so that another motion
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
can be made and a request a division
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
vote please thank you

in the interest of time no remember does
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%

hb
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
1604 repeals an exception in the medical
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunizations act that was
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
added during the committee of conference
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
last year and restores the law to the
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
version that was passed by this body and
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
the other chamber with one distinction
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
which was necessary to allow compliance
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the federal cms covid vaccine
 
02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
with the federal cms covid vaccine
mandate

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
you may have heard from lobbyists that
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed it would result
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the loss of medicare and medicaid
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
funds and certification for our state
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
medical facilities
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
the truth is this bill is amended allows
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
for near perfect compliance with cms
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
survey requirements allowing for medical
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
a third exemption the right of
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
conscience exemption is not delineated
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the cms rule however it is a right
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in part 1 article 4 of the
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state constitution and the
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire cannot be
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
permitted to violate its own
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
constitution by not permitting such an
 
02:18:12.719 --> 02:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
constitution by not permitting such an
exemption

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
other states such as florida and
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
arkansas have passed and implemented
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
laws that require additional exemptions
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
than what is expressly permitted in the
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
cms rule and have had no issues of loss
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
of funding for their facilities and
 
02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:28.950 align:start position:0%
of funding for their facilities and
providers

02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
their surveying agencies have simply
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
informed cms of the law and have
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
continued conducting their surveys and
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
issuing certification
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
cms made no indication that they would
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
be pulling funding denying reimbursement
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
or in any way penalizing those states
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
the supreme court upheld the authority
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
of cms to issue a covet vaccine mandate
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
but only in part sending the case back
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
to a lower court with the opinion that
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments need to be made surrounding
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions for employees
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
the state of florida and the national
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
association for health facilities survey
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
agencies which represents agencies
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
across the country that perform these
 
02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.150 align:start position:0%
across the country that perform these
surveys

02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
expect forthcoming adjustments in the
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
cms rule to allow for articulation with
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
the conflicting state laws
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
as these conflicting laws with
 
02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
additional exemptions such as for
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
natural immunity right of conscience and
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
others are expected to increase this
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
year across the nation
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day cms exists to
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide payment for health care costs
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
for the most needy and slight variations
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
and exemptions for coveted mandates will
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
not result in denial of payment for
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
services to these people
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
this bill will be going to finance if
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
passed by this body today
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
the bill only applies to those
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that are owned by the state
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and its political
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions not private businesses
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
the attorney general of new hampshire
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
has ruled that the medical freedom and
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations act that this bill affects
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
only applies to covet 19 vaccinations
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
and nothing in this bill prohibits or
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
impedes the ability of these facilities
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
to employ mitigation strategies such as
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
screenings testing and ppe policies for
 
02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
screenings testing and ppe policies for
employees

02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
there was already a health care
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage in our county nursing
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
homes before the cms rule and it has
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
only worsened since then the county
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are constantly running
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
short on staff
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
all american citizens including medical
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
professionals already have a right to
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
accommodations for medical issues under
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the americans with disabilities act and
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
for religious beliefs under the civil
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
rights act of 1964.
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for healthcare workers
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
employers have changed the process from
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
one of checking a box and signing a form
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
for exemption as was typically done for
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
flu shots to one that amounts to be a
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
degrading and intrusive exchange that at
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
times demands years of medical history
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
of an employee including medical records
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
or a religious inquisition where a
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative from hr makes arbitrary
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
and discriminatory judgments on the
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
validity of a person's religion
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
it is nearly impossible to get a medical
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
exemption because doctors fear
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
punishment from regulatory boards for
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
writing them
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
many companies are just outright denying
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
all exemptions against federal law this
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
is illegal but most people do not have
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the ability or finances to sue for their
 
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:27.910 align:start position:0%
the ability or finances to sue for their
rights

02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill ensures that that can no
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
longer happen in our state
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
medical facilities an employee simply
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
submits a simple statement requesting an
 
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:38.790 align:start position:0%
submits a simple statement requesting an
exemption

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
as the risks and poor effectiveness of
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccines become clearer and the
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
harm that mandates create is brought
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
into focus
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
other countries like the united kingdom
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
have started to eliminate their mandates
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
for healthcare workers the uk cited low
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy against omicron variant
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
and a critical health health care worker
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
shortage in their decision to drop their
 
02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:01.429 align:start position:0%
shortage in their decision to drop their
mandate

02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
how does it make sense that some nursing
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
homes in new hampshire are permitting
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
positively tested nurses and other staff
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
to work but not on vaccinated staff
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
in healthcare we have the right of
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy it's the nurse's job to
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
ensure self-determination for patients
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be protected for
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
everyone including
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
how they still have their right of
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
health conscience and beliefs to
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
consider when making personal medical
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that right must be preserved
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
for health care workers as well when it
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
comes to staffing shortages the ones who
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
suffer the most when there are not
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
enough workers in the facility are the
 
02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
enough workers in the facility are the
patients

02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
after patients it's the remaining staff
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
who suffer we need to prevent burnout
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
and moral distress for our health care
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
workers the state of new hampshire needs
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
to set the standard and say that it's
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
unethical and unconstitutional to deny
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
skilled competent medical professionals
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
employment and to deny patients the
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
staff to take care of them please
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill and i request a roll
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%

a division
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
there has been a request for roll calls
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's officially seconded
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1604 is the majority
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
report about to pass as amended this is
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
kenner for a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
know that the united states supreme
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
court has already rendered an opinion
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
that it clearly
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
supports the cms mandate requiring
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination of health care workers
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
in institutions which receive
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from medicare and medicaid
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb1604 is amended
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
would place the state of new hampshire
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the rules of the cms
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
and if i know the lack of compliance
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
with this mandate may lead to loss of
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
accreditation of our institutions and
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
loss of medicare and medicaid
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursements leading to the need for
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to backfill
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
funding to keep our hospitals and
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes open
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know also that it is so soon
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
after the mandate that of course payment
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
has not been withheld in other states as
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
there are steps in enforcement that
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
occur before that and if we make
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
assumptions about cms revising their
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
rules we do that at our peril
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the healthcare
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage predated the mandate
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
would i then vote no using that nice red
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
button on the otpa motion so that
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
another motion can be brought forth
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%

mr speaker we are doing the amendment at
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
this point correct yep yes thank you
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is on the amendment yes yes i rise
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
today to speak against the committee
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb1609
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
1609 has introduced correct some of the
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
most troublesome provisions of the fetal
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
life protection act an act which
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislated the practice of medicine
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
regarding pregnancy termination after 24
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
weeks of gestational age
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
hb1609 as introduced would add
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions not present in current law
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
for rape incest and for the presence of
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
severe fetal anomalies which are
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life and remove the
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary ultrasound mandate
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
if amended by the majority amendment it
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
would only remove the mandate for an
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
ultrasound before an abortion if the
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
fetal age is less than 24 weeks
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
but we need to pass this as introduced
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
your gestational age is a very rare
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
medical procedure usually done
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
in major medical procedures as centers
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and nearly exclusively because of the
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
discovery of a severe fetal anomaly
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
which is incompatible with survival of
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
the infant or when the pregnancy results
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
in a severe risk to the mother's health
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies may be discovered before
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
24 weeks but the severity may not be
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
apparent until later and some people may
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
not even have prenatal care before 24
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
weeks given our underinsured and
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
uninsured patients
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
now it's devastating for a mother and
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
father to be confronted with a severe
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly that's not compatible with
 
02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:13.030 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly that's not compatible with
survival

02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
survival
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
and accepted medical choices available
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
to parents are either termination of the
 
02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:18.710 align:start position:0%
to parents are either termination of the
pregnancy

02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
or to carry to term
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
and provide comfort care till the baby
 
02:37:22.479 --> 02:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
and provide comfort care till the baby
dies

02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
dies
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
this difficult decision should be made
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
by the parents
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the provider
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
not legislators
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting the choice of termination
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act forces the
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
mother to carry the pregnancy to term
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
go through labor and delivery
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
only to deliver a stillborn baby or
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
watch their baby die
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
the majority report claims that abortion
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
did another one go down
 
02:37:54.479 --> 02:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
did another one go down
okay

02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
is not an issue
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
as the woman has offered emergency
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
contraception often called the morning
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
after pill
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
but that is not true
 
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of rape or incest a woman
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
may be too traumatized to seek care in
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
time to use emergency contraception
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
which must be done within just a couple
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
of days to be effective and a survivor
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
of incest may not be able to even access
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
health care for termination due to being
 
02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
controlled by the abuser or may not even
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
be aware
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
of being pregnant until 24 weeks
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're a child
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
only 20 states require the provision of
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
emergency contraception services and in
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire ews are not required to
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
provide information about emergency
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
contraception or to dispense it upon
 
02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:40.309 align:start position:0%
contraception or to dispense it upon
request

02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
only 17 percent of women who are raped
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
undergo a medical exam after assault and
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
fewer than 40 percent of emergency rooms
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
provide emergency contraception or even
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
inform women
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
seeking care after assault that such
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
treatment is available
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
given that there are an estimated 25 000
 
02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
rape related pregnancies per year in the
 
02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:00.230 align:start position:0%
rape related pregnancies per year in the
u.s

02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
it is a problem
 
02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the majority report also noted
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
anecdotes about false positive diagnoses
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
of severe fatal fetal anomalies
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
while the currently available new
 
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
chromosomal deletion screening blood
 
02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
chromosomal deletion screening blood
tests

02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
tests
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
are being used a great deal and do have
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
a notoriously high positive rate false
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
positive rate women facing this
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
difficult decision are referred to
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
highly specialized centers before
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
termination where more accurate
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
confirmatory diagnostic methods and
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
counseling will be used
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
in summary the majority amendment will
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
remove the important exceptions for rape
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
incest in fatal fetal anomaly leaving
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
only a revision of the ultrasound
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
mandate so please press the red button
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%

02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
original bill which is far better can be
 
02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:51.670 align:start position:0%
original bill which is far better can be

02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%

02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
that statement mr speaker i would
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
suggest was disingenuous
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
of course it had to be the strictest
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
prohibition because today it's the only
 
02:40:47.279 --> 02:40:48.870 align:start position:0%
prohibition because today it's the only
prohibition

02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
i could similarly
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
say that what we passed into law was
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
therefore the mildest one ever
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
introduced into new hampshire
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
interestingly many states red and blue
 
02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:03.510 align:start position:0%
interestingly many states red and blue
alike

02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
alike
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
have fetal protection laws more strict
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
than ours

extreme right wing states
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%

politically quite similar to ours
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently mandates ultrasounds
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the pregnancy and furthermore
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
requires that women actually view those

our own modest law does nothing of the

our own modest law does nothing of the
kind

02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
kind
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee believes
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
that changes in the law should be
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
offered only after a new law has had the
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
chance to demonstrate itself in practice
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
not just in ferry
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the hearing a few people gave
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
testimony stating
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
in criminalizing those who perform most
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 weeks
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
our state would have trouble recruiting
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
quality medical workers
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
to say this ignores two truths
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
first it assumes all or nearly all
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
medical workers wish to perform
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
abortions while we know that many do not
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
second and more profoundly
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
for quite some time massachusetts
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
imposed felony penalties for most
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 weeks with no
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions for fetal anomalies
 
02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:32.269 align:start position:0%
exceptions for fetal anomalies
nevertheless

02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts was routinely ranked as
 
02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
having the best medical care in the
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
country additionally
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
a few raise the question of rape and
 
02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:45.190 align:start position:0%
a few raise the question of rape and
incest

scientific research
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
indicates that many victims of rape and
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
incest take a morning after pill
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whether that person is
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant or not
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
and in most
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
every other case
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
those who do not wish to carry their
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
baby to term
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
can choose and do choose to terminate
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
their pregnancies before 24 weeks
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is six months
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
moreover we heard testimonies of women
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
who had been told they were carrying a
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
child with a quote
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%

despite being thus advised or in some
cases

02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
cases
pressured

02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
pressured
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
they chose not to
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the babies they delivered were
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
healthy and free of any such anomalies
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i work
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
some with the dd developmentally delayed
 
02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
or disabled community
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
i refuse to see
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
the dd people
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
as being
 
02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:55.670 align:start position:0%
as being
anomalies

02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
finally there have been statements made
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the requirements around ultrasound
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
are onerous
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
any confusion about ultrasounds
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
any scruple about their frequency
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
or their type such as being invasive
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
have been adequately addressed in this
 
02:44:13.439 --> 02:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
have been adequately addressed in this
amendment

02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i

move we pass the amendment by pressing
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
a division has been recalled for so this
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
will be a division vote
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
division

02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%

02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
question before us is on
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1609
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
weber for a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
if i know that cases of rape
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
and of incest
 
02:45:51.630 --> 02:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
and of fetal anomalies which are
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
are among the most painful situations
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
that any individual or any family will
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
ever face
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that persons of conscience
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
and persons of deep faith
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
may be called to different conclusions
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
when faced with those difficult
 
02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:20.150 align:start position:0%
when faced with those difficult
decisions

02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
would i now
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
preserve the rights
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
of every person
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
to make that difficult decision
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
for herself in consultation
 
02:46:36.399 --> 02:46:37.429 align:start position:0%
for herself in consultation
with

02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:46:37.439 --> 02:46:40.230 align:start position:0%
with
whomever

02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
she believes
 
02:46:42.399 --> 02:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
she believes
is

02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
an interested and helpful advisor
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether medical professional priest or
 
02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:51.429 align:start position:0%
whether medical professional priest or
whatever

02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
to defeat this amendment
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative folsom
 
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
if i know that many states around the
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
country require pre-abortion ultrasounds
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
all throughout pregnancy
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i know that already our fetal life
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:19.030 align:start position:0%
protection act
only

02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
requires pre-abortion ultrasounds in
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
very narrow circumstances
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
and that this committee amendment
 
02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
simply reiterates and
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
re-clarifies the limited nature of the
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
and if i recognize
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
that once this amendment is passed and
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
accept it we will see how many of our
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislators care about the confusion
 
02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.349 align:start position:0%
legislators care about the confusion
around

02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound requirement which is very
 
02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:56.230 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound requirement which is very
light

02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
light
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
and finally if i
 
02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
and finally if i
and

02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.190 align:start position:0%
and
i

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:51.429 align:start position:0%
that accommodations can be made and this
law

02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
would not affect
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
any such employees or employers
 
02:57:56.640 --> 02:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
any such employees or employers
however

02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
a small percentage of citizens do have
 
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
trouble or inconvenience
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the polls
 
02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
given the relationship between their
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
work shifts and the polling hours
 
02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would help
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
that relatively small percentage of
 
02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
that relatively small percentage of
citizens

02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
i offered an amendment to house bill
 
02:58:20.950 --> 02:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
1207 in the labor industrial
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services committee
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
amendment 0286h
 
02:58:28.469 --> 02:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
and this amendment would have provided
 
02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
various protections to employers
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
the time off would have been
 
02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
limited to only up to a maximum of two
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
hours the employer would receive notice
 
02:58:40.319 --> 02:58:41.349 align:start position:0%
hours the employer would receive notice
of

02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
an interest in the time off and would
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
have had an opportunity for some input
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
on that and when it took place most
 
02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
on that and when it took place most
importantly

02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
if the employee had a certain ability to
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
get to the polls outside of working
 
02:58:57.910 --> 02:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
hours then this bill would not apply to
 
02:59:01.590 --> 02:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
that employee or employer at all
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
now this amendment was voted down
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
however representative state your point
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%

yes i believe the motion on the floor is
itl

02:59:10.389 --> 02:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're hearing discussion of
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
an amendment i don't believe there's any
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
four amendment and there is no amendment
 
02:59:18.389 --> 02:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
to be discussed
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
the member is correct we need to speak
 
02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the itl not the amendment thank you
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
the majority objected to this bill
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
on the basis that employers would be
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
required to pay
 
02:59:41.830 --> 02:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
employees for the time off
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
this would be for a maximum of two hours
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
at election time
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a relatively few employees
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
there are 29
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
at least 29 other states the united
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
states that have equivalent statutes and
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
at least 20 of those
 
02:59:58.319 --> 02:59:59.750 align:start position:0%
at least 20 of those
explicitly

02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
allow for paid time off and these
 
03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:03.030 align:start position:0%
allow for paid time off and these
include

03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
such conservative states as texas
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
oklahoma tennessee and utah what is your
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
point of voter point of art the
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman is continuing to speak about a
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us is a three hours
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you can confine your remarks to
 
03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and not the uh
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
my amendment yes thank you mr speaker i
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
apologize i will i will make every
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
effort to do so in fact i will do so
 
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would uh place only the most
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
modest of burden uh on employers
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
and only in circumstances where the
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
burden was in great service to our
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
democracy voting is arguably our most
 
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
crucial right it's the right that makes
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
other rights possible we should all want
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
to see the maximum number of citizens
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
participating in our democracy
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we should be prepared to ensure that
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
this happens
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
i ask you to vote against this itl so
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
we all want everyone to be able to vote
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
even if we don't agree with how they're
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to vote everyone should have the
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
right to vote i as an employer give each
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
one of my employees an hour off to vote
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:01:45.190 --> 03:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us was going to mandate
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
that employers pay up to three hours
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
for someone to vote
 
03:01:51.359 --> 03:01:52.389 align:start position:0%
for someone to vote
well

03:01:52.389 --> 03:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:01:52.399 --> 03:01:54.630 align:start position:0%
well
employers

03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
employers
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
have to take on that burden they may not
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
be able to afford if they have a small
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
organization to allow that
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
and they're not getting the production
 
03:02:04.399 --> 03:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
and they're not getting the production
time

03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
the labor committee is
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
very reticent
 
03:02:11.670 --> 03:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
at putting mandates
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
on businesses to do something
 
03:02:17.429 --> 03:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
so while we all hope all employers
 
03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
will give their employees time to vote
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
and while we know there's absentee
 
03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:23.269 align:start position:0%
and while we know there's absentee
ballots

03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
and other mechanisms
 
03:02:26.230 --> 03:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
we feel
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is asking too much
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.230 --> 03:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
division has been requested
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members

if i know that the ability to vote is

equally important as the right to vote
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
and if i know that paid time off to vote
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
directly supports this right to vote

03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody has got the message
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we're in suspension until everybody
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
quiets down
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill house bill 1538 fn only
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
applies to the prevailing wage on state
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
projects not local nor private projects
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
and is therefore within our purview
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
in purchasing
 
03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
compared with contractors and consumers
 
03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
the state lacks the ability to actually
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
shop around for better contractors and
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
better workers as private companies and
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
consumers always do
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i believe that we should
 
03:24:27.990 --> 03:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
privatize as many state activities as we
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
can however
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
when we do get down to public works
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
projects we have a responsibility to the
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
next generation to build to last to
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
build durable
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
and to build well under prevailing wage
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
contractors hire more experienced higher
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
wage workers
 
03:24:46.399 --> 03:24:47.429 align:start position:0%
wage workers
who

03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
experiences shown waste less building
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
material and get injured statistically
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
about 12 percent less often reducing
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
workman's comp and injury expenses
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the result of better work done by more
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
experienced local tradesmen
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
is lower maintenance costs and greater
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
durability as well as keeping more of
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the money here in state
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
since it tends to be new hampshire
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
workers getting the benefit of the
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage and cutting the demands
 
03:25:15.830 --> 03:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
later on social services and charities
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
michigan did repeal their prevailing
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
wage law but so no
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
no net reduction in initial building
 
03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
no net reduction in initial building
costs

03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
another nearby state added the
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage law and saw only a two
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
percent two to three percent increase in
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
building costs since more than ninety
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
percent of new hampshire's construction
 
03:25:35.830 --> 03:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
jobs are non-union this is not a union
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
issue but a matter of merely increasing
 
03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
issue but a matter of merely increasing
wages

03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
wages
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
by an order of magnitude more than the

thank you mr speaker
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
the prevailing way is wage is determined
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
when the federal government sends out
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
information to contractors
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
asking them to complete them
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
asking what their division is there's
 
03:26:11.349 --> 03:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
multiple divisions whether it's plumber
 
03:26:11.359 --> 03:26:13.110 align:start position:0%
multiple divisions whether it's plumber

03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
electrician
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
site contractor fill out the information
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for a wage and send
 
03:26:19.590 --> 03:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
it back
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a situation where very few
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
people in the say kawas county send it
 
03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
people in the say kawas county send it
back

03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe one person sends it back
 
03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's abnormally high
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
or abnormally low
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
you could set that prevailing wage
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
which could be any part of the spectrum
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
twice what the average rate is that's
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
being paid in cowas county or half of
 
03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:43.349 align:start position:0%
being paid in cowas county or half of
that

03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%

takes three to five years
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
this has not been proven effective
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
i disagree with what is written in the
 
03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
blurb that a prevailing wage
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
allows for new hampshire people to be
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
hired not at all
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a prevailing wage in

rockingham county
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's likely that a maine or
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts contractor will bring in
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
those residents to do the work
 
03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
those residents to do the work
so

03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:17.429 --> 03:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
when it came to the hearing itself
 
03:27:17.439 --> 03:27:18.630 align:start position:0%
when it came to the hearing itself
unfortunately

03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was not able to be there as
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
he was sick
 
03:27:25.349 --> 03:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
not one group organization
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
showed up in favor of the bill
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
one large group came one person spoke
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
against it
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
this does not do some of the things that
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
people think it does
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe in a more urban state where
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's bigger cities and what have you
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
but you do not get the participation in
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you're not going to get
 
03:27:48.389 --> 03:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
good data the prevailing wage is not
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to be consistent with what the
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
wages are and for someone to say that
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
without a prevailing wage we don't
 
03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
provide good enough wages for our
 
03:27:56.960 --> 03:27:58.229 align:start position:0%
provide good enough wages for our
employees

03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%

03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:28:01.830 --> 03:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
you don't slap me in the face mr speaker
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
i would ask that
 
03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:04.229 align:start position:0%
i would ask that
the

03:28:04.229 --> 03:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:04.239 --> 03:28:05.269 align:start position:0%
the

03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
follow with the labor committee and
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:26.080 align:start position:0%

so

03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:42.870 align:start position:0%

03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the
 
03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislating motion on
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1538
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
that a prevailing wage statute will
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
benefit new hampshire construction
 
03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:05.429 align:start position:0%
benefit new hampshire construction
workers

03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that prevailing
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
wage is good for the new hampshire
 
03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:10.389 align:start position:0%
wage is good for the new hampshire
economy

03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
would i then press the red button to
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl motion so another motion
 
03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%

infantine for parliamentary inquiry
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know the
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage does not necessarily
 
03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
mean new hampshire
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
workers are going to get paid any more
 
03:30:29.670 --> 03:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
or any less
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
if i know that many new hampshire
 
03:30:35.190 --> 03:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
construction workers are being paid more
 
03:30:37.269 --> 03:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
than members just south of the border
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
who do have a prevailing wage
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that a
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage would increase the price
 
03:30:47.190 --> 03:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
of construction costs for new hampshire

this story particularly poignant
 
03:35:39.030 --> 03:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
you see it is believed by some that
 
03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
wentworth cheswell
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%

those of us who have taken the time to
 
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%

03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:04.239 align:start position:0%

blank check for a portrait to be painted
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%

03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
displayed in our state house our
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee was not comfortable with the
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
financial aspect of that arrangement the
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill may well have died but for our very
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%

portrait
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply authorizes the
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
joint historical committee to accept the
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
portrait and find a suitable spot where
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
seen in the white house excuse me in the
 
03:36:34.780 --> 03:36:34.790 align:start position:0%

03:36:44.309 --> 03:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
pointing out that in addition to all of
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%

single most important tool in our effort

and energy related pollution
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%

energy we all save money
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't need to produce as much

03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
well while we just heard this morning
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
sir yes if i know that i just heard the
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
governor mention how important
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is and yet we don't want
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
to discuss energy efficiency or
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
and if i know that energy efficiency by
 
03:58:14.070 --> 03:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
definition is the most cost effective
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
way to use energy and if i also know
 
03:58:19.510 --> 03:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire saves
 
03:58:22.229 --> 03:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
funded through the reggie program only
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
approves energy efficiency programs that
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
have been evaluated to provide more
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
benefits than they cost
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
if i further know that rebating less to
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
customers provides
 
03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
for more funding of energy efficiency to
 
03:58:39.510 --> 03:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
all residents of new hampshire and
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
finally when i know that reducing the
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
demand for energy in new hampshire
 
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
reduces both electric bills and
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
pollution to all residents then would i
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
now press the red button to uh table to
 
03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:55.840 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam speaker
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is a very nuanced subject and i
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
know that there's not one member
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the std committee that is opposed to
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
further study
 
04:03:18.800 --> 04:03:19.990 align:start position:0%
further study
however

04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
the telecommunications industry is not
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
waiting for our study without
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
legislative guard rails an interim study
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
will not prevent 5g roll out
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
an interim study will be a moot point
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
with the replacement bill being over a
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
year away an interim study may conclude
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
that there are significant health risks
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
posed by a particular range of mid-band
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
radiation that would be enhanced by over
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
saturation of tower placement
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%

year away
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
an interim study may conclude
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
our significant security risks by over
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
reliance on chinese technology
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
huawei is the world's leading tech
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
leading supplier of 5g technology
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
our own nsa cia
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
and other us intelligence agencies have
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
concluded that if huawei equipment is
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
embedded even at the edge of 5g networks
 
04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
china could easily siphon data off and

guidelines
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%

an interim study may show that the ftcc

04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
this means nothing if the
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry has already
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
rolled out 5g without any legislative
 
04:06:16.439 --> 04:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
rolled out 5g without any legislative
guidelines

04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote now
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that an amended bill may be brought
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
forward that provide legislative
 
04:06:23.680 --> 04:06:24.790 align:start position:0%
forward that provide legislative
guardrails

04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
guardrails
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
londonderry recommend representative
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
thomas to speak in favor
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman or speaker
 
04:06:42.640 --> 04:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman or speaker
um

04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
this bill unfortunately was an early
 
04:06:46.479 --> 04:06:47.349 align:start position:0%
this bill unfortunately was an early
bill

04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
it there was no time to to create an
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that might have been amenable
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
to tall parties
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as is written would require
 
04:07:02.150 --> 04:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
towers to be about sixteen hundred and
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
forty feet away from most public places
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
this uh i won't say this arbitrary uh
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
figure but it was a figure that was
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
developed out of um a commission that
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
was done
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh it was unclear to us
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
exactly why that distance was chosen but
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
we do know that it would affect a lot of
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
businesses and hospitals if the antennas
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
and towers were placed that that far
 
04:07:26.640 --> 04:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
and towers were placed that that far
away

04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the industries
 
04:07:30.720 --> 04:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the industries
scientists

04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
04:07:32.160 --> 04:07:33.590 align:start position:0%
scientists
that

04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
this technology is safer at a much
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
closer distance we
 
04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
the fcc and the faa and international
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
organizations have claimed that this
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
technology was safe
 
04:07:46.080 --> 04:07:47.429 align:start position:0%
technology was safe
however

04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
we cannot deny
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we also heard and understood
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
testimony from medical scientists the
 
04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
testimony from medical scientists the
public

04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:07:56.080 --> 04:07:56.790 align:start position:0%
public
and

04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
some doctors
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
that have seen people be affected by
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
radio waves in various forms
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
there may be a correlation between where
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
people live in radio waves but we are
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
uncertain as to potentially causation
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
we felt we needed more time to study
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
this so that a proper
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation could be made that might
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
be acceptable acceptable to both parties
 
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
because of that our subcommittee
 
04:08:29.110 --> 04:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
recommended interim study
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the committee recommends interim
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
study i hope the house
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
votes for interim study thank you
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is interim study
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
for hb 1644 a division vote has been
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.560 --> 04:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
 
division

04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%

samson

04:09:53.590 --> 04:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
samson
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry thank you
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
if i underst if i understand the
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
sentiment of those who support interim
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
study because of the lack of information
 
04:10:06.479 --> 04:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
study because of the lack of information
available

04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
but i also know that a thorough 300 page
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
report by study commission was already
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
completed and recommended a safe
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
distance between 5g polls and
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
residential areas to be adhered to
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
so that any health impacts remain
 
04:10:24.399 --> 04:10:26.149 align:start position:0%
so that any health impacts remain
negligible

04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
negligible
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that a bipartisan
 
04:10:31.110 --> 04:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is available to temporarily
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
stop 5g deployment in new hampshire
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
until numerous unanswered questions are
 
04:10:36.239 --> 04:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
until numerous unanswered questions are
addressed

04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new to 5g pole
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
deployments could require a pole
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
deployment on every city block
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
generating its own electromagnetic
 
04:10:47.600 --> 04:10:49.030 align:start position:0%
generating its own electromagnetic
radiation

04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
and finally if i further know that the
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
proposed interim study recommendation
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
would not even temporarily stop 5g
 
04:10:55.920 --> 04:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
would not even temporarily stop 5g
deployment

04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
deployment
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
and that the results of that study would
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
be too late for any action to be taken
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
allow a motion
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
to pass with amendment to be made so
 
04:11:11.110 --> 04:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
that 5g deployment can be temporarily
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
halted in new hampshire
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
notter for a parliamentary inquiry thank
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
you madam speaker
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
if i know that 5g is an encoding
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
technology not a frequency nor the power
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
of the broadcast if i also know that 5g
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
is a marketing term used to indicate the
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
next generation of cell phone and data
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
equipment the member will suspend
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
i hope there's no videotaping going on
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
because that's not allowed
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
the members should be in their seats
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker if i also know
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
that 5g is a marketing term used to
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
indicate the next generation of cell
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
phone and data equipment built on 3g and
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
4g technology
 
04:11:58.229 --> 04:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
further madam speaker if i know that we
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from individuals who say
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
that certain frequencies make them ill
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
but other sources testified that this
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
claim is the result of misinformation
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
lastly madam speaker if i know that the
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
claims of illness concerned us enough to
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
not want to kill the bill but further
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
study the issue and hear more counter
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
arguments from the scientists who dispel
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the claims would i then press the green
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
button and send house bill 1644 to
 
04:12:27.670 --> 04:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
interim study thank you madam speaker
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
the question on the floor is to send hb
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
1644 to interim study if you are in
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
favor you will press the green button if
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
you are opposed you will press the red
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
button voting stations will be open for
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%

have all members president had the
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote the house will

same with the following resolution
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
resolved that is an expedient to

i pulled this from consent because it

was only there due to my mistake
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee asked before
 
04:51:04.628 --> 04:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
we left the executive session that it
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
not be put on consent and i failed to

make sure that
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%

committee report was accurate as it
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
appears to have been changed
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere during the submittal process
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm still investigating how that

and i'm still investigating how that
happened

04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%

these types of bills are ineffective

the entire point of this bill

04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%

on everyone's face
 
04:53:36.560 --> 04:53:37.990 align:start position:0%
on everyone's face
however

04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:53:41.190 --> 04:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
it is easy to go to the governor and ask
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
for a proclamation
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
from that body
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
without from that office without
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
passing a bill through this committee or
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
this house
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
therefore i ask the house to support
 
04:53:56.160 --> 04:53:57.110 align:start position:0%
therefore i ask the house to support
the

04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
itl motion the bipartisan itl motion of
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
state your question i have a true
 
04:54:13.030 --> 04:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry mr speaker
 
04:54:13.040 --> 04:54:14.628 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry mr speaker
um

04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have to try and figure out a
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
phrase this correctly
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
my my parliamentary inquiry is about the
 
04:54:21.600 --> 04:54:23.590 align:start position:0%
my my parliamentary inquiry is about the
timing

04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
timing
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
that would be required on a motion
 
04:54:29.590 --> 04:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
if the itl were to pass
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
to seek a judicial opinion on whether
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
this chamber has the authority to
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
instruct the governor to issue a
 
04:54:36.718 --> 04:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
instruct the governor to issue a
proclamation

04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
proclamation
 
04:54:38.400 --> 04:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
proclamation
would

04:54:39.430 --> 04:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
would that be something
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
that like could that be introduced after
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion was made or
 
04:54:48.550 --> 04:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
would that motion have to be made
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.760 --> 04:55:16.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.638 --> 04:55:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the past representative i think we've
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
had numerous types of this legislation
 
04:55:27.040 --> 04:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
had numerous types of this legislation
before

04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
and if this was uh as i've been advised
 
04:55:34.390 --> 04:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
by the clerk if this was to
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sent to the supreme court
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'd have to kind of lay this on the
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
table and then move forward with a
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
separate motion
 
04:55:41.200 --> 04:55:42.708 align:start position:0%
separate motion
so

04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
i i haven't actually read the bill
 
04:55:45.440 --> 04:55:46.230 align:start position:0%
i i haven't actually read the bill
but

04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
if it actually says the governor will do
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a little bit different but
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
i think almost anybody wants to go to
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
the governor get a proclamation or a day
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
name for somebody can do that
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:56:00.958 --> 04:56:02.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
um

04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have no division in this
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right the motion before us is the
 
04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
itl motion on hb 1262.
 
04:56:11.200 --> 04:56:12.948 align:start position:0%
itl motion on hb 1262.

concerns about making the sponsor happy
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee does not believe it's
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do to pass bill if i know
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%

blazik
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker current law
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
requires every child to have a lead test
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
i do not question the wisdom of lead
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
testing but i disagree with any medical
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
mandate and h.b 1642 takes that mandate
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
a step further by requiring this test
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
for school and day care attendance
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently a parent may opt out of the
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
test but this in this bill does not seek
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
to change that but i can personally say
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i was never notified by my child's
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
doctor that this was a state requirement
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
or that an opt-out form existed
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
the main argument for this bill is that
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
there is low compliance with the
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to lead test a child
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
by mandating this test for schools and
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
day cares the sponsors hope that
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
compliance will increase
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be clear a lead test has a personal
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
benefit only and no community benefit it
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
is not the role of government to force
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
individual medical procedures on
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
citizens and i object to any bill that
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
attempts to coerce compliance by
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
tricking people
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
most people like myself are unaware that
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
they can opt out and if they see a
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
school or daycare requirement they will
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
be coerced
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
in addition by the time a child is
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
school aged the damage is done
 
05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
the real focus should be on removing
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
lead from homes not forced testing after
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
toxic exposure
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
government seems to have lost sight of
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
the true role of public health
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
we fund dhhs to educate the public
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a low lead testing rate that
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
is a failure of dhhs to do their job and
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
the solution is not to mandate a test
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
and ultimately all medical decisions
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
should be made with informed consent and
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
are a decision between a doctor and a
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
patient not the government
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
get the government out of my parenting
 
05:03:03.670 --> 05:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
decisions and out of my pediatrician's
 
05:03:03.680 --> 05:03:04.708 align:start position:0%
decisions and out of my pediatrician's
office

05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
i urge you to press the red button and
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's getting exceptionally loud in here
 
05:03:15.760 --> 05:03:17.430 align:start position:0%
it's getting exceptionally loud in here
again

05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%

05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative kenner
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
the requirement for lead testing already
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
exists in law
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
increase the mandate whatsoever
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
because that requirement already exists
 
05:03:39.670 --> 05:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the process of exemption is already
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
in that law
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
parents are allowed to be exempted
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
it is important to understand that
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
it is of great public health importance
 
05:03:48.958 --> 05:03:50.708 align:start position:0%
it is of great public health importance
because

05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
it yes we'd rather catch them one or two
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
years old but they may go into daycare
 
05:03:54.878 --> 05:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
years old but they may go into daycare
at

05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
two years old and that's a good time to
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
catch them so we can guide
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
not only treatment because we can treat
 
05:04:03.510 --> 05:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
them with chelating agents but also to
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
guide selective remediation
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
my colleague is questioned about the
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
fact that we should try to just
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
remediate all the homes just to
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
remediate the most troublesome homes in
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would take approximately
 
05:04:15.280 --> 05:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would take approximately
one

05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
billion dollars that's with a b
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
so it is not realistic to consider that
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
we will re rehabilitate all of our
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
housing stock in new hampshire which is
 
05:04:27.030 --> 05:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
the oldest in the nation so we need to
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
be able to selectively do it and that
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of sb247 so we test kids
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
we get that information we can then
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
selectively guide
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
and it is an impact on the state overall
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
because lead test lead poisoning is a
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
devastating problem for kids that leads
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
to enormous costs with
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
developed neural development issues
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
so it does not all it does it's a it's a
 
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
point of contact to remind the parents
 
05:04:55.590 --> 05:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
that if the provider hasn't already done
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
it that they should be getting it done
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
and there is an exemption that already
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
exists and that exemption is carried
 
05:05:01.440 --> 05:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
exists and that exemption is carried
forward

05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%

mr speaker d2
 
05:05:08.070 --> 05:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
for what reason is remember rise i'd
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to request a roll call
 
05:05:27.670 --> 05:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative blazik requests the roll
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i have a piano it is sufficiently
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.480 --> 05:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
tabling

05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
05:06:25.120 --> 05:06:25.130 align:start position:0%
to lay on the table house bill 4 16 42

laser for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that the
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
focus of public health should be
 
05:06:36.080 --> 05:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
focus of public health should be
removing

05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
removing
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying issue which is led in
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
homes not requiring a test years after
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
the damage is done and if i know that
 
05:06:47.910 --> 05:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
low compliance with lead testing is a
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
result of failure of public health
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
agencies to educate the public
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that medical mandates such as this
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
simply trick parents into compliance
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
without informed consent that i would
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
now vote yes to table this bill
 
05:07:04.160 --> 05:07:05.190 align:start position:0%
now vote yes to table this bill

parliamentary inquiry
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know mr speaker that this does
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
not add a mandate but instead it is a
 
05:07:14.230 --> 05:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
reminder at a point of contact that the
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
testing needs to be done which is
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
already mandated and for which there are
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
already exemptions in law and if i know
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that changing that really is not germane
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
to the issue of this bill and ready to
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
be taken up with a new bill and if i
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is amended actually
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
removes of the large scope that was
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
initially in this bill would i then
 
05:07:35.910 --> 05:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
to not table this so we can carry on and
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
improve the health of our kids and get
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
the lead out

you very much mr speaker if i know that
 
05:11:33.910 --> 05:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not impose a new mandate
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
but that the requirement for testing
 
05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
already exists in it this bill is simply
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
improve the knowledge of the community
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be done
 
05:11:46.470 --> 05:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that addressing this

05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%

taken up in another session another year
 
05:11:54.550 --> 05:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not germaine to this bill
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%

05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
but the committee amended it to apply to
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
every county so
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's taking two-year terms that are
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
traditional going back to the founding
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
of the county some of those counties go
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
back to 1769
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
the time of the pine tree riots
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
i had i had uh
 
05:21:01.510 --> 05:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
office of legislative research look into
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
the tradition of two year terms they can
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
go back to the year
 
05:21:05.280 --> 05:21:08.628 align:start position:0%
go back to the year
1878

05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
back until 1878 we've had two-year terms
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
for county officials
 
05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
so this bill if you listen to the public
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
testimony it was introduced to only
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
apply to to the county attorney in
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
rockingham county that was later
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
corrected to apply to every county
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
official in rockingham county and then
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment on page 60 bottom of page
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
60 in the calendar applies it to every
 
05:21:30.080 --> 05:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
60 in the calendar applies it to every
county

05:21:32.070 --> 05:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
so we care about democracy we care about
 
05:21:34.558 --> 05:21:35.670 align:start position:0%
so we care about democracy we care about
protecting

05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
the voices of our constituents this
 
05:21:40.230 --> 05:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
would mute their voices
 
05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to county officials
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
because it would cut their their ability
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:21:46.868 --> 05:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
in half going from two years which has
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
been tradition
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
to four years so they'd be able to vote
 
05:21:52.070 --> 05:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
half as often
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
now that might be a good idea in
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
the association of counties testified in
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and they said that
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good test bill it's a
 
05:22:05.430 --> 05:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
good pilot program
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
applying only to rockingham county
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
i agree with that let's see how it works
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
in rockingham county but don't force the
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
other nine counties to go from a
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
two-year term to a four-year term
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
for a county attorney county treasurer
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
register of deeds and the sheriff
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
now focusing on the county attorney in
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county we had a derelict
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
county attorney that the ag's office had
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
to come in take over the account the
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
attorney's office
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
actually run the affairs of hillsborough
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
county's office
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
if that was a four-year term we would
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
have been stuck with that derelict
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
attorney for four years so
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want this in hillsborough
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
county as far as i can tell you might
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
hear that the counties want it how do we
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
know that the counties want it did we
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
take a vote of our constituents or are
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
we only listening to the people that are
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
already in power and likely to get
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
elected again
 
05:22:56.958 --> 05:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
elected again
so

05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
focusing on county attorney it's true
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
that a county attorney does not make
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
laws but they uphold the laws that we
 
05:23:02.638 --> 05:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
laws but they uphold the laws that we
pass

05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they wield something called it's
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
called prosecutorial discretion
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial discretion it's it's a
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
hidden power in the structure of
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
government what prosecutorial discretion
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
is is who do you charge and how how
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
severely do you charge them they get to
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
decide that
 
05:23:22.708 --> 05:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
so not
 
05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
not having that
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
position be accountable as accountable
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the voters i think is an issue
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposing the underlying bill but
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
i am opposing amendment 120h
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of page six yeah i ask that you
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
vote down the amendment
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
let this experimental bill go forward
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
and let's see how it works out in
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
rockingham county before we force the
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the state to do it i asked for a
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
division vote thank you mr speaker
 
05:23:50.310 --> 05:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.320 --> 05:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

05:23:51.750 --> 05:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative take my
 
05:23:59.910 --> 05:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
question it's just a quick one uh on of
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
course you know we're rockingham county
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
we fully support this here but when i
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
was at the meeting are you aware that
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
nobody from any of the counties came in
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
and spoke against us
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm aware i served my first term on
 
05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
municipal county and it tends to be no
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
offense to the committee it tends to be
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
sort of captured by selectmen and
 
05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
moderators people that listen to the
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
interests of towns
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
and counties
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
the public doesn't always come because
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
they're not motivated so if we say that
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
the counties want this how do we know
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
that the counties want this let's make
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
it enabling legislation let's make the
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
counties get to vote on whether they
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
want a four-year term instead of two for
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
all the county positions so
 
05:24:43.600 --> 05:24:44.548 align:start position:0%
all the county positions so
uh

05:24:44.548 --> 05:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
i would say take it with a grain of salt
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
people that are in power they want to
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
stay in power
 
05:24:52.230 --> 05:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
two-year two-year terms are good for the
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
for the governor the executive council
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
state senate for us and for county
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
commissioners they all run for two-year
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
terms this is history going back a very
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
long time at least to the year 1878
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
according to house research
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
why would we want to take this
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
experimental bill and make the whole
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
state do it
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
let's vote down the amendment and let's
 
05:25:13.350 --> 05:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
have a separate debate on the underlying
 
05:25:14.548 --> 05:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
bill that would be my recommendation
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment before us now
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
would assure
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
our important county officials are
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
indeed at
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
work i value
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if i value their hard work
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
and need their professional assignments
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be focused on
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
i would be in favor of this amendment
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
and if i know the sheriff will be
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
holding a campaign sign
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
rather than being in a squad car
 
05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
arresting criminals looking to break
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
into our homes
 
05:26:10.160 --> 05:26:10.948 align:start position:0%
into our homes
and

05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
put our children and teachers at risk
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know our prosecutors ought to
 
05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
be trying criminals
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
in front of judges
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
i will vote this amendment
 
05:26:31.830 --> 05:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to assure all county officials all
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
officials are actively working for our
 
05:26:34.718 --> 05:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
officials are actively working for our
citizens

05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment passed
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
the municipal and county committee by a
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
vote of 17-2
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
not a single objection at our committee
 
05:26:47.040 --> 05:26:49.270 align:start position:0%
not a single objection at our committee
hearings

05:26:49.270 --> 05:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
came forward from commissioners
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
to express their objections
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
so this is truly a bipartisan
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
the 1702
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%

05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
and if i know this legislation did not
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
pass last year because it didn't include
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:21.920 --> 05:27:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:27:22.830 --> 05:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:27:25.510 --> 05:27:25.520 align:start position:0%

05:27:25.520 --> 05:27:32.150 align:start position:0%
recommend you vote green to pass the
amendment

05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
is the vote on the amendment
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%

05:27:45.280 --> 05:27:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
a

05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%

division has been requested members will
 
05:27:55.350 --> 05:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.360 --> 05:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
division

05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.360 --> 05:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment to house bill 1397
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative airman
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
if i know that the likely reason no
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
other county showed up is because the
 
05:29:30.788 --> 05:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
title of the bill says rockingham county
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
and not every county
 
05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that government is always more
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
efficient with less input from the
 
05:29:37.280 --> 05:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
efficient with less input from the
voters

05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
voters
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that's not a good thing
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that this amendment is likely
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a poison pill on the whole
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
experimental bill that rockingham county
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
would like to try
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that two years is good
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
enough for the governor the senators the
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
05:29:56.548 --> 05:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
state representatives county
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
commissioners it should also be good for
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
sheriff's county attorneys
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
register of deeds
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
and treasurers
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
that a four-year term locks us into
 
05:30:11.910 --> 05:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
paying them a four-year salary instead
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
of renegotiating every two years
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
would i then press
 
05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
the red button and vote this amendment
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative rung for
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
 
05:30:31.190 --> 05:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
speaker mr speaker if i know that this
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill extends the terms for just certain
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
elected county officers including the
 
05:30:38.230 --> 05:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
county sheriff
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
and the county attorney from two years
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
to four years and if i know that these
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
positions require professional expertise
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
and are often full-time jobs
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that a four-year term
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
provides more stability and focus
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
to address county needs without the
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
disruption of biennial campaigns
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%

lay on the table house bill 1656
 
05:42:53.830 --> 05:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote the chair
 
05:42:55.750 --> 05:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative samsich for a
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
05:43:02.548 --> 05:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
if i agree with the previous speaker in
 
05:43:08.708 --> 05:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
support of hb 1040
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
and if i know that new hampshire's
 
05:43:13.750 --> 05:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
bridges and roads need extra in revenue
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that the new hampshire dot's 10-year
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
plan is more aspirational instead of
 
05:43:19.200 --> 05:43:20.628 align:start position:0%
plan is more aspirational instead of
practical

05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
practical
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
transportation revolution of which the
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
previous speaker spoke will not be
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
waiting for two years for us
 
05:43:31.590 --> 05:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the outcome of the hb 1040
 
05:43:31.600 --> 05:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
and the outcome of the hb 1040
commission

05:43:33.510 --> 05:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
and if i
 
05:43:38.070 --> 05:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe unlike the majority report that
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
this bill does not put the cart before
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
the horse but quite the opposite
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
and if i further note it's also
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for this body to agree to
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
raise new revenue despite the needs that
 
05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
and finally i think it is time for new
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire to deliver also on the
 
05:43:58.948 --> 05:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
promises that it made to 49 locations in
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
that are negatively impacted by traffic
 
05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
noise and are still waiting for those
 
05:44:07.030 --> 05:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
promises to be fulfilled
 
05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
would i now vote
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
red against tabling motion
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%

look at road usage fees that this bill
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%

new hampshire democratic party's state
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee since 2020 and obviously as a
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
democratic member of this house
 
05:55:10.948 --> 05:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
yet i observed as a leader within this
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
party is a party that does not follow
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
the ideals of democracy or follow its
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
own constitution
 
05:55:19.110 --> 05:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
the nhdp constitution states that the
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
state committee shall govern the party
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
between state conventions
 
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
chapter three of the new hampshire
 
05:55:26.230 --> 05:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
democratic party's constitution states
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the state committee and
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm quoting this it is the
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the members of this
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
democratic state committee to
 
05:55:34.948 --> 05:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
participate actively in formulating
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
policy conducting business and
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining the financial stability of
 
05:55:40.310 --> 05:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
the state party as necessary or
 
05:55:41.590 --> 05:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to carry out the goals of
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
the nhdp
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
yep as a former member of the state
 
05:55:46.390 --> 05:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee i can tell you that this was
 
05:55:48.310 --> 05:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
never followed through on
 
05:55:50.470 --> 05:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
there was no opportunity for input or
 
05:55:50.480 --> 05:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
there was no opportunity for input or
discussion

05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:55:53.350 --> 05:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
at any of the state committee meetings i
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
ever attended
 
05:55:55.520 --> 05:55:56.788 align:start position:0%
ever attended
similarly

05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
chapter 2 section b states that the nhdp
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
conventions shall adopt the platform of
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
the nhgp nominate presidential electors
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote on amendments to the constitution
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the democratic party promote party
 
05:56:09.030 --> 05:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
unity and carry out the actions
 
05:56:10.868 --> 05:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
necessary to further the goals of the
 
05:56:10.878 --> 05:56:13.350 align:start position:0%
necessary to further the goals of the
nhdp

05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
nhdp
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
this means that the convention is the
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision-making body of the
 
05:56:16.718 --> 05:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision-making body of the
party

05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
every single democratic member of this
 
05:56:19.600 --> 05:56:20.470 align:start position:0%
every single democratic member of this
house

05:56:20.470 --> 05:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
is automatically a delegate to this
 
05:56:22.160 --> 05:56:23.590 align:start position:0%
is automatically a delegate to this
convention

05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:56:25.190 --> 05:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
as all the democratic members of this
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
chamber should recall last year's
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
convention we were tasked with voting on
 
05:56:31.270 --> 05:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the party's constitution
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
that included 56
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is 5 6 56
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
alterations to the constitution
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
yet the same thing occurred
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
no delegate was allowed to voice their
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
opinion and debate this important change
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the party's governing document at the
 
05:56:47.520 --> 05:56:48.788 align:start position:0%
to the party's governing document at the
convention

05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
to make things worse the nhdp office
 
05:56:53.350 --> 05:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
refused to provide the contact
 
05:56:53.360 --> 05:56:54.868 align:start position:0%
refused to provide the contact
information

05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
of any state committee member or
 
05:56:58.470 --> 05:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
convention delegate
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
to any state committee or convention
 
05:57:00.080 --> 05:57:01.430 align:start position:0%
to any state committee or convention
delegate

05:57:01.430 --> 05:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
delegate
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
think of it like this
 
05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
imagine the new hampshire house except
 
05:57:07.110 --> 05:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed to speak and debate
 
05:57:08.788 --> 05:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
on the house floor and we are not
 
05:57:10.708 --> 05:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk to one another outside
 
05:57:11.910 --> 05:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
05:57:13.910 --> 05:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
that is the sad reality of the new
 
05:57:16.708 --> 05:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire democratic party
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
to continue with this theme of and
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
democratic practices
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
it seems that the chairman of the
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
democratic party leads his party with an
 
05:57:24.868 --> 05:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
iron fist
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
as a member of the state committee we
 
05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
are tasked with electing the officers of
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
the party
 
05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
last year we had such an election
 
05:57:32.948 --> 05:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
in that election i endorsed and voted
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
for the chairman's opponent
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
this seems to have gotten me on what i
 
05:57:39.910 --> 05:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
affectionately call his blacklist
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
last year shortly after the officer
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
election i was running for a seat on my
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
local school board
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
in that campaign i faced unprecedented
 
05:57:47.280 --> 05:57:48.628 align:start position:0%
in that campaign i faced unprecedented
hatred

05:57:48.628 --> 05:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
hatred
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
from threats of violence to trespassing
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
to destruction of property
 
05:57:54.390 --> 05:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
i was going through a lot to say the
 
05:57:54.400 --> 05:57:56.390 align:start position:0%
i was going through a lot to say the
least

05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
least
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
one such incident was where one of my
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
supporters pride flags was burnt
 
05:58:02.708 --> 05:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
after putting their uh
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
after putting my campaign sign on their
 
05:58:06.868 --> 05:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
property which was also destroyed that
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
very same night
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
although i voted against ray buckley i
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
still respected him and thought he
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
i could count on him as the leader of
 
05:58:16.230 --> 05:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
the party
 
05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i texted him for help with this
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
situation for help and advice
 
05:58:22.470 --> 05:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
he responded
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm busy
 
05:58:26.470 --> 05:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
send me an email
 
05:58:27.670 --> 05:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i did
 
05:58:29.350 --> 05:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
i also sent the very same email to the
 
05:58:31.750 --> 05:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire democratic party's office
 
05:58:33.670 --> 05:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on a year since i sent
 
05:58:35.990 --> 05:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
that email and i have yet to hear back
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
from the party
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire democratic party says
 
05:58:41.350 --> 05:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
that it stands for minority groups such
 
05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
as the lgbtq plus community yet when i
 
05:58:46.868 --> 05:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
as the youngest openly gay legislator in
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
this country in the history of the
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
united states reached out for help
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
i was ignored
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
these are just a few of the reasons of
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
why i left the democratic party
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
now the reason i chose to spoke here
 
05:59:03.910 --> 05:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
before you today is to educate the
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
democratic members of this house on the
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
issues facing their party and to inform
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
the public of the hypocrisy of the
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
so-called democratic party of new
 
05:59:11.520 --> 05:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
so-called democratic party of new
hampshire

05:59:13.030 --> 05:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
if you are a democratic member of this
 
05:59:14.558 --> 05:59:15.830 align:start position:0%
if you are a democratic member of this
house

05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and you have seen what i have seen and
 
05:59:18.948 --> 05:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
agree that the way this party is run is
 
05:59:19.910 --> 05:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
not right
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to take a stand and
 
05:59:25.030 --> 05:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
leave the party as i have until it fixes
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
its major flaws
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
when i took my oath of office i did not
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
take it to a political party
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
but to our united states constitution
 
05:59:35.750 --> 05:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
and our new hampshire constitution and
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
most importantly i was elected to do
 
05:59:39.430 --> 05:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
what is right for my constituents of
 
05:59:39.440 --> 05:59:40.470 align:start position:0%
what is right for my constituents of
amherst

05:59:40.470 --> 05:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
amherst
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
i want to be very clear this has nothing
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the leadership of the
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
democratic caucus and everything to do
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
