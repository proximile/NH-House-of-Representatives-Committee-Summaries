trial period
um

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
would you say that this will also bring
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
out the need for more child care i feel
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
like i hear from a lot of people who
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
can't even find child care right now so
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
how are we going to
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
make sure they all have a place to go
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
once they apply for this
 
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
once they apply for this
question

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%

this is
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
a very important bill
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh so a couple questions one one is the
 
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.829 align:start position:0%
uh so a couple questions one one is the
um

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
do we know child care providers who
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
have we spoken to them to see their
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
likelihood of volunteering for this
 
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
likelihood of volunteering for this
program

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh in in the follow up
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
do we do we know uh
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh potential costs what are we looking
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
and uh one more for me
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh attendance base is that still gonna
 
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh attendance base is that still gonna
happen

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
are we gonna are we gonna be paying
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
attendance based
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
is just for three reimbursement right
 
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
is just for three reimbursement right
okay

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm jackie cowell from
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
early learning new hampshire
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here actually representing two
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
different organizations early learning
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which we are a statewide
 
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which we are a statewide
organization

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
organization
representing

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
child care providers the families they
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
serve we're a statewide nonprofit and
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
i'm also here because the chair of the
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire child care advisory
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
council couldn't make it she works at
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley daycare and she was
 
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley daycare and she was
needed

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
there at the center and she couldn't
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
come so
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire child care
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
advisory council is a legislatively
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
enacted body to advise the health
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
as well as consult with the governor and
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
the department of ed on child care
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
issues so i'm here today saying that
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
both of us support this bill
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
sb 144 again
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the main purpose of this again is to
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
pilot as senator whitley said
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of enrollment-based scholarship
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's actually the federal government's
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation that this is the best way
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
to provide what's the child care
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
scholarship the subsidy system those
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
families who are income eligible to
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
receive these services they can't afford
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
the full cost so therefore the state
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
pays a portion depending on their income
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and then the rest comes from the family
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
depending on their income as i said and
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
what this bill does enrollment base
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
versus attendance base right now we're
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
in attendance based there's you know um
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing better than we had in other
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
years where you're simply not there you
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
you don't get the child care scholarship
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
children are sick the family can't
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
afford it the child care provider has to
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
charge in the full cost they don't have
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
reserves to do it so it's really this
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
helps level the playing field between a
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
family who qualifies for their income to
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
get child care and families who are
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
private paying
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the typical policy in the child care
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
center is
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
whether you come or not you pay right
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
for for a private pay client because
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
again whether the child is there and not
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
the teachers there the lights are on the
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
heat is on et cetera they can't afford
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
to do it that way so enrollment based
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship in the child state child
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
care scholarship system really again
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
allows that level of the playing field
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
that allows programs to open their doors
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
and say okay
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
i can i can open my door to a family
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
who's um
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
who is uh income eligible i don't have
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
to worry about not getting paid i don't
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
have to worry it just that's that's a
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
worry that gets taken off the provider's
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
mind and certainly it's terrific for the
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
family that's the number one reason
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know the family doesn't have to then
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
their child is sick they lose they lose
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
time at work they may work at most many
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
work at hourly um
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
at hourly rates so they don't get paid
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
when they don't show up their child is
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
when they don't show up their child is
sick

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
sick
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
they have to then pay extra to the child
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
care center it's a really
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
lose-lose situation so this mitigates
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
that that's why we support it again the
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
federal government recommends it as a
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
policy for states and we're looking
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing what the um
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh what the cost is the the difference
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
between our attendance based and this
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment based after the pilot is done
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh and to answer your questions yes
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
so there are some child care programs in
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
our state uh representative long who
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
they do um
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
what they're called enrolled in the
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship system they're
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
they open their doors so if a family
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
comes in who's income eligible require
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
can get the child care scholarship
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
they accept those families there are
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
some who are not enrolled
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
and our hope for this and that number
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
we do have the folks in the department
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
of health and human services behind me
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
but some years there's a large who taken
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship and some some
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
years there's fewer
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we really want everyone in the child
 
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
and we really want everyone in the child
care

00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs to open their doors to
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
any family with any income as long as
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
again it's a good system and the
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
enrollment base makes it a better system
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
more likely they will take children who
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
whose families are income eligible
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.790 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah on online seven it says
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of income
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
so it says the child care scholarship or
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
subsidy plays a significant role in
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring all new hampshire families can
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
access quality safe and reliable child
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
care regardless of income
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh interestingly that doesn't
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
that was maybe an error yeah
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
so what it is is um the child care
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship in new hampshire system goes
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
up to what's um about i think it's like
 
00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:02.230 align:start position:0%
up to what's um about i think it's like
65

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
65
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the state median income so in other
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
words um it's uh it's a family of three
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
you but you guys know this better than i
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
do probably forty five thousand dollars
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
a year earning um so anyone under that
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
but again if if you um are receiving uh
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
tanf if you're at the lower end of the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the income spectrum you receive more
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
scholarship and as you raise your income
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
you get less scholarship but it's capped
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
at either 250 percent of federal poverty
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
level which is still
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
like i said about family of three forty
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars a year
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and i have one more question
 
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank you and i have one more question
um

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
on page two on line four
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
it says the department shall include
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
as part of the biennial budgetary
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
process the full cost to provide
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
enrollment-based reimbursement
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
attendance-based payment to child care
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
providers who accept
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
so can you explain to me because it
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
looks like to me that regardless of how
 
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.429 align:start position:0%
looks like to me that regardless of how
this

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
three-month trial comes out we're doing
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
this no matter what
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
is that is that my correct understanding
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
that is the intent of course would be
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
through the budgetary process anyway but
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes i understand what you're saying did
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that language thank you for for that
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
question that language was added as a
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
result of some significant negotiation
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the department i think there was a
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
lot of support for actually just making
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
the change
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.789 align:start position:0%
this was
uh

00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know agreeing to a three-month pilot
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
rather than a longer pilot or just
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
making the change was the result of
 
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
making the change was the result of
negotiations

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um but here's the thing you know
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
depending on the cost you know
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the you know the legislature can do what
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
it will do so really it just allows the
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
agency it requires the agency to put it
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
in their budget request but then of
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
course the legislature has a very
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
important role in determining whether it
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
actually makes it into the budget
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay and can you just explain real quick
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
that where it says regardless of income
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
miss can can be misconstrued because i
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
think you mean that
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of income people will be able
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
to get child care so that the people
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that can afford it can but i think as
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
you read the bill it sounds like it's
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
saying that regardless of your income
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
you can qualify for this program thank
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question so that the so
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're referring to line
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
seven correct yep so in the statement of
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
findings it's really that sort of
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of income is more a general
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
statement where we say the child care
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship plays a significant role in
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring that equality so it's not
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
saying it's not specifically saying that
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
someone has access to the scholarship
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
program regardless of income
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
but that the that the the program in
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
general plays a role in that balance of
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
who can access it or not happy to look
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
at an amendment though if that works i
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
just feel like it might be a little sure
 
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
just feel like it might be a little sure
um

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.710 align:start position:0%
um
misleading

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes to people
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
run into
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
problems further down the road
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and maybe we could
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
add something you know just referring
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
income guidelines and statute or
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
regulations or something like that
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for miss cowell
 
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.350 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for miss cowell
representative

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
just uh long clarity on uh line six
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
but the way i read this is that if i
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
could afford child care i'm all set
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
this program helps for those that can't
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
so am i correct uh with assuming that
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
attendance base
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
currently is on a sliding steel
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
scale and that enrollment base would be
 
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.630 align:start position:0%
scale and that enrollment base would be
a

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
pre-determined amount agreed to by the
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
provider gotcha um actually
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
attendance-based and enrollment-based um
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
is different only in how it's paid by
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
attend it so there's no pre-agreed
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
amount what it means is for whatever
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're scheduled for
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
like private play clients they the state
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
pays their portion
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
and the families still pay their portion
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
whether they show up or not but um
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
attendance-based is
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
whether they come they they may not come
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the state doesn't pay depending on
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
how how many they've been if they've
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
been out all week etc etc so it puts the
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
family at risk of having to pay the
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
difference that the state doesn't pay
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
with attendance based okay uh follow-up
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
where this
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
is an incentive for the provider ah
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah it may not be is there better is
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
there a better guarantee for the
 
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
there a better guarantee for the
provider

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
there is this scenario there is because
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
of how it's paid out by the state so if
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're enrolled if the family is a
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship eligible family
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
right this is the only this only affects
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
these families who are income eligible
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
so the difference is it's more
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
guaranteed because the state will pay
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
what they're scheduled to attend even if
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
they are absent so it's again what
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
senator whitley said like a business you
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
can count on certain income all the
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
private pay clients pay that way it's
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
just leveling that playing field the
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
same method of of counting on income
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay and uh one more for me
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
just the um
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh just to clarify on the uh
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
hhs budget request so if this um
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know if this report comes out that
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's not working
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
then i would assume they
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put it in their budget request
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah correct
 
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.549 align:start position:0%
yeah correct
uh

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good it's a good question but i
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
think you know what this does is trying
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
to figure i
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
the department can can speak to that but
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the department is if it's affordable my
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is department thinks
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment based is a good way to go
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
right so it's not and and other states
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
that do it again it's leveling the
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
playing field but if so i don't think
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's that it wouldn't work it's just
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
what it would cost
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.789 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
this entire bill as amended uh
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
was created to
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
allow parents to remain in the workforce
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
right that's right
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that the workforce
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
consists mainly of
 
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.909 align:start position:0%
consists mainly of
three

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
work shifts
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
and most day cares are open during the
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
nine to five or six or six to six
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh child care facilities do we have that
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
facilitate the three to eleven and
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
eleven to 7 group of
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
parents that may be eligible
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
for the scholarship
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh there aren't that many representative
 
00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.390 align:start position:0%
uh there aren't that many representative
um

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
again hhs may have a better and accurate
 
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.230 align:start position:0%
again hhs may have a better and accurate
number

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is that
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
i believe as part of the arpa
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds for dhhs there's a
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
look into
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
how to expand and have more of those
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
other shipped hours at the same time
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
i've been in the field for 30 plus years
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire many centers have
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes tried to open up those
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
offerings and what ends up happening is
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
the children the moms and dads
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
understandably want their children in
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
their own bed or they want them in they
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't want them in a center you know
 
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.269 align:start position:0%
don't want them in a center you know
overnight

00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's been um when when a lot of
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
programs that i've been aware of
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that offer it and decide to
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
try it parents just don't want
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
that option they want to figure out a
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
way to get reimbursed or help for
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
someone else to be in the family or
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
um or in a home but not in the center
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
but they they might be able to answer
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
you in terms of what if there's any
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
plans underway
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think you may know that even with it
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
even with the center-based i think
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative rice sort of mentioned it
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
too that that you know
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
many many families can't access it now
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
even in the day
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
that whatever we can do yeah
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
welcome are there any further questions
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
all right saying none thank you very
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
um up next will be karen hebert
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%

morning

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%

join have her join me to answer some of
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
the more particular questions that i've
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
been hearing so far that she could
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
provide information for
 
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.269 align:start position:0%
provide information for
but

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
first of all i do want to thank senator
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
whitley for the work that she has done
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
a tremendous work that she has done in
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
supporting child care in the state
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is really all about
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
supporting families
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
better as well as our workforce in the
 
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.269 align:start position:0%
better as well as our workforce in the
state

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.630 align:start position:0%
state
um

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
so in order to
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
this as senator whitley mentioned this
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
is one
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
step one particular
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do to support child
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
care in the state and strengthen it
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
things that this does certainly is
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
looking at
the

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
the
cost

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
for an enrollment-based program compared
 
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:35.669 align:start position:0%
for an enrollment-based program compared
to

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
absentee billing program that we have
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
essentially if
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
we are able to show that this
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
really has been effective for families
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
it may increase the utilization of the
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship program this is a
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
federally funded program that at the
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
moment is arguably underutilized and we
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
would like to see an increase in that
 
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
would like to see an increase in that
so

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
any questions i'm happy to answer or
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative long big amount of chairs
 
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.269 align:start position:0%
representative long big amount of chairs
uh

00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the ccdf is underfunded i mean not
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
underfunded it's underutilized
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're hoping that the enrollment base
 
00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
you're hoping that the enrollment base
will

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
increase utilization of this funding
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
yes so there at the end of
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh calendar year 2021
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
there were 799 providers across the
 
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
there were 799 providers across the
state

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
608 of them at the end of that year were
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled in the scholarship
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
program accepting
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
families who were eligible for the
 
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.590 align:start position:0%
families who were eligible for the
scholarship

00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
so we anticipate that we could do better
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
and increase the number of providers who
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
are able to
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
use the scholarship program for families
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
that would increase the number of
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
families able to
 
00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
families able to
have

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
child care so that they can get back to
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%

organization that educates advocates and
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%

families
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm here today to talk about our
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
strong support and partnership with
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
senator whitley early learning new
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and our state partners and
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
looking at how enrollment-based billing
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
can be used to help families access
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship i'm just going to
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
speak to a couple of questions although
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
i've handed in some robust written
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
testimony about how access to child care
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
is primary prevention it's also good for
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce but we know that it helps
 
00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
the workforce but we know that it helps
mitigate

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
aces and trauma that children may face
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we know that is an issue for our
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
state in speaking with senator whitley
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
just now i think that a suggestion if
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
the committee would take it would be to
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
just strike lines six and seven instead
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
of trying to come up with
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
additional language i think that's a
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
finding i don't think that it's
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
important to the context of the bill and
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
i believe senator whitley agrees with me
 
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:53.830 align:start position:0%
i believe senator whitley agrees with me
there

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to emphasize a couple of
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
things number one as
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
jackie cowell spoke from early learning
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire enrollment-based billing
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
is promoted by the federal government as
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
a policy around child care development
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
block grant dollars it's also a explicit
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
authorized use for federal discretionary
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
child care development block grant
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
when covid hit there were
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
different relief dollars there were
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
specific dollars for child care in this
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
program this is an authorized way to use
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
those discretionary dollars just so the
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
committee knows that the other thing
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
that i want to talk about is that
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the state did use enrollment-based
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
billing during the pandemic
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a way to stabilize the child care
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
market it wasn't a
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
a specific program change they used
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
disaster billing they could fill you in
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
on exactly how that works but to kind of
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
answer representative long's questions
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this would be
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
a program that worked we know that it
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
did work
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have the data of how many more
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
families but we know that it stabilized
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
the market we know that it's important
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
from our family's perspective that we
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
hear that it allows them to really
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
consider child care if they know that
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be penalized if
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
their kid is out we still have
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions around covet if you're out
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
for five days um
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
so i'll just represent that we're in
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
strong support of this bill we have
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
worked with senator whitley and state
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
partners i'm happy to answer any
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
questions but
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 326

00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and good morning
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
again to the members of the committee uh
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is becky whitley
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm honored to serve new hampshire
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
senate district 15 including the
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
communities of concord henniker
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and warner
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill senate bill 326 has
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
introduced established an office of
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
early childhood to coordinate
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
consolidate and integrate early
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
childhood programs
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
as our current system as our system is
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
currently designed
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
there remains an alphabet soup of state
 
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:36.149 align:start position:0%
there remains an alphabet soup of state
agencies

00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
that you know provide a variety of
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
services to our young children and
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
families and as fem and many families
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
and even as a legislator i can attest to
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
that this system is confusing
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
complicated and hard to access
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
so the idea of creating a single office
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
of early childhood will actually empower
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
our families with a one-stop shop for
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
the care and support that they need
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
the amended version that you have in
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
front of you looks a little different
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
than how the bill was introduced it
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
retains the important findings that led
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill but instead of actually
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
creating the office it directs the
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dhhs in consultation
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner of department of
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
education the child advocate counsel for
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
thriving children all the people we know
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
who are experts and children
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
to develop a plan to actually create the
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
office by november 1st 2022.
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
so this the pursuant to the bill this
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
process and timeline will track
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
with the steps that are actually already
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
in motion through the council for
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
thriving children and work at the dhhs
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
and ensure that there is a plan in place
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
um answering some of the questions that
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
were raised in the senate in again in
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
time for the next budget cycle right
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to sort of back up
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
towards about why this is really
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
important i think folks on this
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee know well that research across
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of disciplines has shown that the
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
early years of children's life are
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
incredibly critical to healthy brain
 
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:09.750 align:start position:0%
incredibly critical to healthy brain
development

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think it uh you know what shows us is
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
that you know what happens in a child's
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
early years will be so important to
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
their readiness for school and of course
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
their readiness to participate in daily
 
00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
their readiness to participate in daily
life

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
so i think in addition to what we know
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
the research says about the benefits to
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
children i think it's important to also
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
look you know we are legislators it's
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
important to look
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
at the financial side of things and
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
research has shown us that there is a
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
significant return on investment
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
in early childhood if we're investing in
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
early childhood we see
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know a lifetime of higher earnings
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
improved education outcomes reduced
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice cost
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
that research is old and it's well
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
established that we will see those cost
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
savings if we invest in early childhood
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned before the state of
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently does have
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
investments in early childhood
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
but it's a very fragmented system it's
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
just you know as with a lot of things
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know things are fragmented through
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
various funding streams that is no fault
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
of state agencies it's just the way that
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
we do things in new hampshire
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
so because of the state government has
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
already identified that this is a
 
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
already identified that this is a
problem

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
the department of ed and the department
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
of health and human services already
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
have a team that is looking at more
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
integration of early childhood they are
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
already on the way to doing this work
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
and moving towards a more integrated
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
early childhood system and i think the
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
department can speak to that work but
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
they do have a team looking at this
 
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.829 align:start position:0%
they do have a team looking at this
across

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
the two different departments and i
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
think from their perspective you know
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
eventually creating an office of early
 
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.069 align:start position:0%
eventually creating an office of early
childhood

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
childhood
 
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
childhood
can

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully result in more efficiencies um
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then of course from my perspective
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about families you know greater
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
access to the services that our families
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
need so desperately
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
so as you can see from the sponsors and
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
just from your own work early childhood
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
really is a bipartisan issue
 
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.910 align:start position:0%
really is a bipartisan issue
on

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
january 23 2020 governor sununu issued
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
an executive order creating the council
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
for thriving children and in that same
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
executive order the governor also
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
directed dhhs and doe
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
to us to work towards establishing a
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
joint office of early childhood and
 
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
joint office of early childhood and
education

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
so it's right there in the executive
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
order this is just the legislation that
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
is necessary to effectuate that
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this bill is to build
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
on that vision to keep us moving forward
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
of course you know within state
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
government we always need those
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
measures of accountability that keep the
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
work moving forward
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
certainly had a phased-in approach i
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
think this this plan also looks at that
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
phased-in approach
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and i will note too that there are a
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
lot of other states that are looking at
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
this um colorado california connecticut
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
georgia hawaii massachusetts montana new
 
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.630 align:start position:0%
georgia hawaii massachusetts montana new
mexico

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
mexico
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
utah virginia washington
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh they are already moving in this
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
direction many other states uh this
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
session and last session
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
also have bills to move into some more
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh in this direction
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
so i think we can all agree that the uh
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know the first years of a child's
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
life are so critically important and
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.230 align:start position:0%
that you know
this

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know those years should not be sort
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
of caught in bureaucratic
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
mess and morass so i think um you'll
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
hear from other folks why it's so
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
important to have the full attention and
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
focus that's equal to the importance of
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
this time of life and how this will
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
really work to integrate services for
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
maximum impact of these investments so
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration i'm
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.670 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
yokela

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
yokela
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
question
you

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.510 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
early childhood
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
is um you know an important time in a
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
child's uh in a person's life
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
but you didn't explain really what
 
00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:14.230 align:start position:0%
but you didn't explain really what
this

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
what the role of government is in the
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
early childhood and what
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
um trying to do
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're not actually parenting the this
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
child um and so what is what is it doing
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
as far as like the goal of this office i
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
guess is is it just educating parents
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
about the opportunities for
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
services and of the needs that are
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
offered by the state
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
currently so it's more of a um
 
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.230 align:start position:0%
currently so it's more of a um
uh

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
way to sh to you know advertise for that
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
or is it um
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
something else that i'm i'm
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
not clear about thank you yeah thank you
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
so already in new hampshire there are a
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot of state dollars going to early
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
childhood child care right there's both
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
state and federal dollars in the child
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's state and federal dollars on
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
other programs
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
that impact
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
early childhood but they're sort of
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
dispersed around state government and i
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
think the whole idea is that
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
um to maximize those investments that
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
are already there right and then to
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
leverage those investments we have a ton
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
of federal money coming in to maximize
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then leverage those investments we
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
need a more integrated system it's too
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
spread out and there's not full
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
attention about how to maximize those
 
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
attention about how to maximize those
investments

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
investments
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
so i think the education piece that you
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
described is incredibly important how
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
how do families access you know the
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
support that's so desperately needed i
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
think that will
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely be a piece to it so it's
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged does that answer your
 
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.430 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged does that answer your
question

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
is there any other ques oh
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
senator whitley for bringing this
 
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.589 align:start position:0%
senator whitley for bringing this
forward

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the bill line part
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
four um four lines 16 through 20.
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
um do we have any
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
are there any reports that i know
 
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
are there any reports that i know
everybody

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the the
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
response to the pandemic and
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that families got those
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
supports when
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
the public health
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
issues around the public health
 
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.950 align:start position:0%
issues around the public health
challenges

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
created around the pandemic meant that a
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that support our agencies
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
were scrambling we were we were
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
scrambling um
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
but now now that we are looking at how
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
do we do this better
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
do we do this better
because

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
that scramble uncovered a lot of gaps
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
why this is here um do we have any
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
documentation from
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
services and
 
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.829 align:start position:0%
services and
um

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
the doe about like
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um so
 
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um so
they're

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes they're i think um so after the
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
executive order created the council
 
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.309 align:start position:0%
executive order created the council
uh

00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
maybe a year later
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
the council for thriving children which
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
is a you know it's a public-private
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
partnership so the chairs of that
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
council are doe and dhhs representation
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is an executive director so it is
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
a public private partnership
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
there was they issued a strategic plan
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
on early childhood in the summer of
 
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
on early childhood in the summer of
2020.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
so that you know sort of provides the
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
benchmarks probably that you're
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
identifying and then right now they are
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the process of updating that
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
strategic report
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
through a very robust process that
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
others behind me can discuss and that
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
should be ready
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
before the next budget cycle so
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
the fall or just
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
december and so i think in that you
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
probably will see more about what was
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
exposed throughout the pandemic
 
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.589 align:start position:0%
exposed throughout the pandemic
follow-up

00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much so if i
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly what you're
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
saying is that that strategic plan will
 
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
saying is that that strategic plan will
actually

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
more or less provide the framework for
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
um for this
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
initiative that's my understanding and
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we really tracked the
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
timeline their timeline and track that
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative alessia
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam share
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this will or will not
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with the actual
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
but if a family is receiving services
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
through dhhs
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
and they apply for the scholarship
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
and they get it they're approved
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it in any way lessen what they
 
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.069 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it in any way lessen what they
get

00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:16.470 align:start position:0%
as a
family

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
food stamps or
 
00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.630 align:start position:0%
food stamps or
other

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
funds that they may receive from dhhs
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's a question for dhhs i
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to provide misinformation
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
about that but thank you for that
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
important question thank you
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so just
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify in my mind
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is a collaborative this is an
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
attempt at a collaborative effort so if
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm taking the opportunity of a service
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire offers
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
i may not be aware of all the other
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
services because there isn't a
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort so would i be more
 
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort so would i be more
aware

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
setting up this joint office
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
on other opportunities i may need with
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
my children's early education thank you
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
for the question i think that's exactly
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
right um it as i discussed with
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative it's about it's a both uh
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know leveraging our current
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
investments and also you know more
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
helpful for families the other thing i
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention and you made me think
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
about that is that you know in new
 
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.390 align:start position:0%
about that is that you know in new
hampshire

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know we have to move to a place
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
where we're less crisis focused and that
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're more future focused and that we
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
are you know not just throwing a lot of
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
money at problems once they happen but
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're preventing problems and that we're
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
planning for the future down the road
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we know that whatever is coming down
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
from washington there continues to be
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant bipartisan support for
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
investment in early childhood what that
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
looks like and how much is very unclear
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
but there will be significant federal
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
investment fairly soon in early
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
childhood both on the child care side
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
and potentially pre-k
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
and if that happened tomorrow we would
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
not be ready in new hampshire for that
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
so this office provides the necessary
 
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.470 align:start position:0%
so this office provides the necessary
structure

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
for incoming federal dollars that we
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
know are coming great thank you
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
up next is rebecca
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
watkowski i know i'm killing that name
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
my name was stephen so i should have
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
stayed with that
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
and she has um yes she does have written
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and she's asked for two
 
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
testimony and she's asked for two
minutes

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%

collaboration between senator whitley
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
and our partners at dhhs and doe around
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
this bill i also want to share that i am
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
a parent representative on the council
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
for thriving children and i am also the
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the strategic planning
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i can't speak on behalf of
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
the council for thriving children but if
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are any questions around the work
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
of that committee i can speak for my
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
experience i just want to confirm
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that senator whitley
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
spoke about the idea of how to better
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
integrate our early childhood system
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
from birth through eight has been an
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing theme for a long time it's not a
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
new idea
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire actually received in 2019
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic 26.8 million dollars
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
in the preschool development grant
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me the preschool development
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
grant is a misnomer for most people it
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
has nothing really to do with the
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
development of preschool in new
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire it has to do with the
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
development of a better coordinated
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
system for kids and families and if you
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
happen to see
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
as part of that governor sununu's office
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
created this great visual i'm sure our
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
friends at the department could show you
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
about what that structure is it created
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.349 align:start position:0%
about what that structure is it created
early

00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
early childhood integration teams in
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
dhhs and doe and also created connection
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
to this larger council for thriving
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
children and the council for thriving
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
children has diverse membership parent
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
representation advocates representation
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
from all different fields understanding
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
that children exist within families and
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
those families may have different
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
touches in parts of the system but we
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
have to acknowledge that it's not easy
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
for families to navigate
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
so i say that all to emphasize that this
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
bill is really timed with the work
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now it allows a
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
touch with the legislature to understand
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
what the ongoing process is and to make
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
an evaluation on how we best leverage
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
existing funding streams how we improve
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
on so the internal side and also on the
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
external side for kids and families
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'll say is that
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
preschool development grant it ends in
 
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.349 align:start position:0%
preschool development grant it ends in
december

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill is also tied with the end
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
of that so that we can look at what
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
parts of that investment
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
can we sustain or should we sustain and
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
how we can we best do it in a way that
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
is fiscally responsible for our state
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions but
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
other than that i'll refer to my
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
testimony that i submit submitted are
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much madam chair
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
for um and thank you for coming and
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
presenting this important work
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
um as a mother of a child with autism
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
and twins
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
i know the importance of those early
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
childhood years and the payoff that
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
comes later on
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
and we have used those services so thank
 
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.349 align:start position:0%
and we have used those services so thank
you

00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to clarify was
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
what specific years are we talking about
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we reference early childhood
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
so is it birth
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
really great so um
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'll explain a little bit the preschool
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
development grant looked at
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
birth through five but our state's
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
council for thriving children looks
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
birth through eight so there's a warm
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
handoff to doe
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that oh no i see one sorry thank
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
you representative ocala thank you thank
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
do you see this as um
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
just a reorganization of our current um
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
system or do you think that this is
 
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.670 align:start position:0%
system or do you think that this is
um

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
leaving those systems in place and kind
 
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:36.870 align:start position:0%
leaving those systems in place and kind
of

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
creating an overarching um structure on
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
top of them to you know
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
facilitate the
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh ex the the information sharing about
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
those programs and coordination between
 
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
those programs and coordination between
them

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'll speak for my
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
role on the council thriving children in
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
view of this i don't see it as building
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
out another government structure i see
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
it as through the process of strategic
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
planning looking at how we are serving
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
families and creating a more streamlined
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
approach to providing that and ensuring
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
that it gets out to more families so i
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
would say it's an assessment of what
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're doing well maybe what we're not
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
doing so well and how to improve it with
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
existing dollars
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's always the opportunity that we
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
may be leaving some dollars on the table
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
for kids and families
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
so you know i think that
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
adding in my role as an advocate for
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
early childhood programming
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
it really is starting to look at how the
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
systems are coordinated how are you
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
catching families
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and really giving them the skills to be
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
thriving and well
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know one example is looking at
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know home visiting programs how are
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
we getting new moms into home visiting
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
programs and how's that tied to family
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
resource centers that also provide
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
services for
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
other family members within that
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
community so it's really i think we've
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
had a history of providing one service
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
and looking at a child in a silo
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is really building up a system that
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
looks like look at a child existing
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
within a family and ensuring we're
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
giving them access to services that
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
allows to get them to keep the family
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
intact and to be thriving and well
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
because that's ultimately what we all we
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call my question
 
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call my question
um

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
do you work with pediatricians as well
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
to get them
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
um you know if a kid is slow to talk
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
like my daughter was
 
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
like my daughter was
um

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know cognitive not where they're
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so do you work and
 
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:40.309 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so do you work and
educate

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
educate
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
educate the doctors of what
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know they need to look for to give
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
children services yeah thank you for the
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
question just to clarify i'm not a
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
service provider so we do advocacy and
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
pediatricians are a population that we
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
aim to include in all the programming
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
that you said okay thank you thanks
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
there any further questions
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
up next is karen hebert from dhhs she's
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
good morning again my name is karen
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
hebert director for the division of
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability for the
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to comment that you
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
know certainly this bill and again
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
thanking senator whitley for her work
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
this bill really brings
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
us enables us to take
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
some pretty significant steps
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
towards really creating a solid
 
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.750 align:start position:0%
towards really creating a solid
foundation

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward which is that plan and
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
identifying what is it
 
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.069 align:start position:0%
identifying what is it
that

00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
would answer the question can the
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
various services and programs across
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
that relate to early childhood
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
can they be more cooperative together
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
and more effective
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
and efficient in a single office
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
there is certainly fragmentation across
 
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
there is certainly fragmentation across
the

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
services multiple services for early
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
childhood and as the representative from
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
new futures has pointed out
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
many reaching branches to each of those
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
where she may have access to groups like
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
pediatricians where the department in
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
our particular role is not a that is not
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
a typical
 
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
a typical
uh

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
connection that the department would
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
make so there are multiple different
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
services and we're really this basically
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
provides the opportunity to have that
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
long overdue conversation so that we can
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
really look at the number of services of
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
early childhood and make some
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
determinations of how can we build a
 
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
determinations of how can we build a
plan

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
that would create
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
a better
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping that the work that has
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
been done over the last few years by the
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
council for thriving children as well as
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
the preschool development grant
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
could really inform this particular plan
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
and that we could use that work that
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've already done to start building off
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and uh really take a a
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
look under a microscope at how to how to
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
create a build a better
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
system thank you
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i have a quick question um
 
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
okay so i have a quick question um
so

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
for this i see that um
 
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.549 align:start position:0%
for this i see that um
when

00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
all the bodies get together and decide
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on is this going to create
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
new positions or are these going to be
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
positions that we're going to pull from
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
each department for people that already
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
are doing these jobs
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that is
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
the necessary part of the conversation
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
for all of these entities to gather
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
together and look at every aspect of how
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're delivering those services what
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
resources are needed what resources
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
could be streamlined where we can work
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
more collaboratively together and not
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
duplicate services as well so every
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
every component of this commissioners
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
from dhhs doe the office of early
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:16.950 align:start position:0%
from dhhs doe the office of early
childhood

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
childhood
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me child advocate
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the department of admin services and
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
the council for thriving children need
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
to have those conversations to make
 
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.789 align:start position:0%
to have those conversations to make
that

00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation in this particular plan
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
and although november is not that far
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
away i think we're optimistic that this
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
is something that we could do to
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
formulate that kind of a plan
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.670 align:start position:0%
um
what's

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
what's
so

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
what is holding you back from
 
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
what is holding you back from
from

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
from
doing

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.710 align:start position:0%
doing
the

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
like the um a large portion of this work
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
now especially um you know what services
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
hhs offers
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
you know
and

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
services that you may be aware of that
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
you can point other people to if they
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
were seeking help
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
 
00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:18.870 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
advocacy

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
as far as the awareness for you know
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
doctors or families that are in need of
 
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.630 align:start position:0%
doctors or families that are in need of
services

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
how what is the struggle for being able
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.109 align:start position:0%
to um
to

00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
advertise essentially those services out
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
to the people that need them
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh i forgot my other question so i'll
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
let you answer that one first
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.309 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
so

00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
the bill basically ignites some energy
 
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.789 align:start position:0%
the bill basically ignites some energy
into

00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:02.069 align:start position:0%
into
creating

00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
the steps that we need to to be able to
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
look at this across multiple services
 
00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:08.309 align:start position:0%
look at this across multiple services
um

00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that we are all so
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
um focused on our competing priorities
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
in each division each
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
department each program that it's hard
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
to stop and start focusing on it but i
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
think that the work that we've already
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
done through the council for thriving
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
children and the preschool development
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
grant is pretty significant that has
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
been moving forward so i think that this
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
basically enables us to build upon
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
the work that's been done
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
and continue
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction
 
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.069 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction
um

00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
not sure if that answers your question
 
00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:47.829 align:start position:0%
not sure if that answers your question
follow-up

00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this follow-up
 
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.549 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this follow-up
um

00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:53.670 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's already this commission that was
 
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.349 align:start position:0%
there's already this commission that was
um

00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
formed by the governor
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so there's already some
 
00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
and so there's already some
enthusiasm

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
i would say uh towards addressing this
 
00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:06.710 align:start position:0%
i would say uh towards addressing this
issue

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe
 
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.710 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe
that

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
um representatives from the agency
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether it be children and family or all
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
these people that are listed would
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
um decline an invitation to go to that
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
um to
to

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
the currently created
 
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
the currently created
um

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh what is it called uh
 
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.630 align:start position:0%
uh what is it called uh
board

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.230 align:start position:0%
board
uh

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
the currently created council yeah to to
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
try and form this
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
plan i guess so
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
i guess what what is this adding that
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
do by just going to that council now and
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
creating the plan
 
00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
creating the plan
so

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that um
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know the intent to be able to
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
develop a plan that may inform the
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
department's budget and what we may end
 
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.990 align:start position:0%
department's budget and what we may end
up

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
moving forward and if we were to create
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
an office of early childhood we
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
do that very methodically very
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
thoroughly but also to inform policy to
 
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.069 align:start position:0%
thoroughly but also to inform policy to
inform

00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
inform
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
the budget going forward and i think
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
that this is certainly motivating a
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
number of the agencies all of us to get
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
together and make that happen
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
is there a barrier that's in the way at
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
the moment i think the barriers are
 
00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:35.829 align:start position:0%
the moment i think the barriers are
certainly

00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:36.870 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know we could speak to our own
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
barriers and with the complexities that
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
this involves incredible complexities
 
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.270 align:start position:0%
this involves incredible complexities
across

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies and to have
 
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies and to have
a

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
a means for
 
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
a means for
um

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know creating that pathway and
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
having us come together i think is has
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
been an important part of this
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's not to say that we couldn't do it
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise however
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think that to enable us to really
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
bring all of these groups together
 
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
bring all of these groups together
that

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill essentially does
 
01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:15.430 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill essentially does
and

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of those barriers may include also
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that as i mentioned earlier we
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
all have
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
highly competing priorities
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we're contending with
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so trying to identify really across
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
multiple programs that we're basically
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
saying this is a significant priority
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
to all of these agencies and being able
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
to come together including the ones that
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
are named in here
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate the
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
multiple components that make up the
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
the bill basically enables those
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
one more follow up
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like that
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that i've heard so
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
far that um
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
it that
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
creation of this or the integration of
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
this was kind of within the scope of
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
the um the executive orders
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
um creating this council for the
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
thriving children and so the creation
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
or or um
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
that that executive order was
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill that says we want
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
you to come up with something to create
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
create this childhood
 
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.109 align:start position:0%
create this childhood
um

01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
streamlined process
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
of services
 
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.470 align:start position:0%
of services
and

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
um so i'm just i'm still just struggling
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
with uh the
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
wh how
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
how this differs essentially from the
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
scope of work that the um that the
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
thriving children uh council worked on
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
are you aware of so the council for
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
thriving children so the early childhood
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
integration teams that were pulled
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
together for that really
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
includes the department of education the
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
and community programs so there's a lot
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
that up however this expands upon that
 
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
that up however this expands upon that
tremendously

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
including the office of child advocate
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
including the department of admin
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
services along with dhhs
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the department of ed um of education
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
to look at formalizing
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
the creation of an office what can we
 
01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:41.029 align:start position:0%
the creation of an office what can we
formalize

01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
formalize
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
across those departments that they can
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
each inform it
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
we want to do this the right way and
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
looking at this as an opportunity to
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
take perhaps
 
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.829 align:start position:0%
take perhaps
perhaps

01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
the only opportunity that we have to be
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
able to do that do it once we want to do
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
one more thank you so since thank you
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
for for taking the follow-up since you
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
you seem to have stressed multiple times
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
about wanting to be thoughtful and take
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
our time to get it right
 
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.190 align:start position:0%
our time to get it right
and

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
yet the um
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the deadline is november 1st right and
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
so can you comment about how you think
 
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.230 align:start position:0%
so can you comment about how you think
that

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
the deadline of november 1st allows you
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
take that thoughtful methodical get it
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
right approach absolutely so the
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
november first deadline is to create a
 
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.549 align:start position:0%
november first deadline is to create a
plan

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
just the plan
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
the implementation of that plan
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
is another phase
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like how it may
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
be altered or changed beyond the plan
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in government local i i
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
do this in manchester a lot is
 
01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
do this in manchester a lot is
collaborations

01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
collaborations
 
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:10.069 align:start position:0%
collaborations
so

01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of entities they want to keep
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
their gig right i don't blame them
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're a non-profit they're doing well
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
in their sector however so collaborating
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
with other um
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know what other entities of the same
 
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
you know what other entities of the same
fashion

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
is this to help
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
that collaboration so even though
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
we may not
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have all these entities out
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
there we need somebody to get them
 
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.829 align:start position:0%
there we need somebody to get them
together

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're getting the our best
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
practice efforts in place is that
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
part of this office doing like for
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
example the oca
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
right what do we need in oca we have
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf we have hhs we have but the oca
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
sort of puts a couple of
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
um a couple of issues into one basket
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
which helps us instead of looking at
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
three different entities we look at the
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
oca and those entities are included in
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
one basket sure is that the same effect
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
so i would state that i believe the
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate had a bit of a
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
different purpose behind it
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
the office of early childhood
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
i mean this this intent yes to answer
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
your question is to be able to create a
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
plan of what so again the representative
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
from new futures mentioned of ju trying
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
to identify what is work working really
 
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
to identify what is work working really
well

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and what isn't where can we make
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
improvements to improve the system of
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
services for families
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
for children so that's what a lot of
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is what we're hoping to accomplish
 
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.069 align:start position:0%
this is what we're hoping to accomplish
in

01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
as we start convening to talk about the
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
development of a plan
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay and uh just to follow up
 
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
okay and uh just to follow up
i

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard reference of oca the office
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
child advocate i don't see it in here i
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
don't see the oca in here
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's in here
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
line 27
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
boy people love correcting me
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
oh i do see it i didn't highlight it
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you you're welcome
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm still struggling a little bit here
 
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
i'm still struggling a little bit here
um

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
on january 23rd the governor issued the
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not understanding in
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
where what has
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
taken place
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
how far you've come in the last two
 
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.829 align:start position:0%
how far you've come in the last two
years

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:43.270 align:start position:0%
years
that

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
that
your

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
belief is that you can accomplish
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
the task
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
by november 1st
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's really a struggle for me
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
can you answer that
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
i think it would be helpful if uh the
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
chief debra nelson were to answer
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
questions about the progress of the
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
council for thriving children she's a
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
bit closer to that than i am i still
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
need a pink card from her for the last
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill also and i think if she's oh
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to speak on this one
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
i need you to fill out a pink card for
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%

office of early childhood and the
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
strategic plan going forward so lots of
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
irons in the fire like all of my
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues here
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
and um when you ask about the progress
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
and you know that's such a good question
 
01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
and you know that's such a good question
because

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
because
we

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
we had a a huge pandemic that really
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
derailed our forward momentum on you
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
know this work of integrating all of the
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
services and the opportunities across
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the state you know within and across
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
dhhs to doe and with our partners in the
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
community however despite the pandemic
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
through the efforts of the council and
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
in particular the
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
early childhood integration team at dhhs
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then our our counterpart at doe and
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
then the integration of the integration
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
teams we we also meet joining the
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
integration teams with integration
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere i am just astounded at the
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
progress that's been made you know where
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
the rubber hits the road of services
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
like in in this past year especially
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
being able to leverage dollars i take
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
our bureau of child development head
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
start collaboration dollars put them on
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
the table with maternal and child health
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
and public health and we co-fund things
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we work together when i develop
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
policy we bring in our child care
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
licensing partners and our dcyf partners
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
and you know advocates and others to
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
look at the policy that we are you know
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
looking at changing our rules and so you
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
know just the fact of having worked you
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
know monthly meetings couple of hours
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
every month over a year with a set
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
agenda and addressing specific topics of
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
different areas relative to an
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
integrated effort in early childhood has
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
really brought us a long way and i think
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
um if the if the committee is interested
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
we could look we could look at an up you
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
know an update report from the
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
integration team so you can just see
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
some of the work but i think some of the
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
same things that are most exciting to me
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
is when i get a call from public health
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
and say i understand that you fund pro
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
solutions you know care solutions which
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
is a online platform for providers to be
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
able to take courses online in their
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
jammies or whatever and many of them
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
free is there any way you can put up a
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
course for us on environmental health
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure that child
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
care and early childhood programs
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of their the
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
environments in which children are
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
learning playing thriving and the staff
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
are working so we said sure so we pulled
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
our money we're going to get those
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
courses up online they'll be free and
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
available so that's just one tiny sliver
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
of an example of true integration their
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
money our platform and getting it out
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
free of charge another example and this
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
one has been underway for a number of
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
years as our watchmego development
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
screening system that was truly taking
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
slices of money from across like four or
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
five different parts of the system
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
pulling it together with no general
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds just you know whatever federal
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
funds we could cobble together in
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
creating a developmental screening
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
system for new hampshire new hampshire
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have one so i hear you know you
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
talk about your children and how do we
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
make sure they get services early well
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's one answer so you know one of
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
the things that we'll be doing through
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
an integrated effort is is really
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
strengthening and expanding that
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
developmental screening system so that
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
all children who need support and
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
services are identified early and the
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
families get the support they need to
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
make sure those children are on track so
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
those are specific examples i could go
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
on and on you know there there are many
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
but i think as
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
ms hebert described we still have a ways
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
to go we still have you know some of our
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
barriers in terms of how our funding is
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
defined for what it can be used and what
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
it cannot be used for and who the
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
population that is defined federally for
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
us of who gets served by those funds but
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
i think you know i've i've been in the
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
state for 15 years now with the state of
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire before that i was at
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire doing early
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
childhood grants
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and i've seen over my 15 years such huge
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
progress in working hand in hand you
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
know within and across the department so
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think this is an exciting time sort of
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
a perfect storm for new hampshire to
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
really move forward on on a plan that
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
will formalize some of the integrations
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we have we have begun so we've
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
begun we have a long way to go
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative g simone
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
um i keep hearing about
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
barriers with funding
 
01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
barriers with funding
once

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
the collaboration is done and the work
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
is done do those barriers go away or do
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
they continue
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
the barriers will continue our
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
approaches will
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
will try to work together so so there's
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
options to braid or blend funds some
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
some funds you can pray together like
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'll put my dollars on the table with
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
yours and we'll have a bigger pool to
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
support families and children but i
 
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.630 align:start position:0%
support families and children but i
can't

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know maybe give your department my
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollars you know it's just we have to
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
pool it whereas blending means we
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
actually put the funds together and have
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
a bigger pot of money so you know those
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
are the kind of federal barriers that we
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
face but states i won't say get around
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
the states work with what they can work
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you what
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative alessia
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me man i
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
didn't even see your hand i actually had
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
the question for uh karen hebert from
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
dhhs who was originally okay at the
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming today and
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
sharing your testimony with us we we
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate it i'm sorry to
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
repeat the same question that i asked
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious it's referencing
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
if persons are currently receiving
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
search services from dhhs
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
and they apply for a scholarship
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
does it lessen the funds that they they
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
do receive from other programs or
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
just even out i'm so glad you asked that
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
question because it's a really great
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
so the the answer is yes it could um so
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
what we're currently doing there's a
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
quite a large project across the
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
department that we're looking at what's
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
known as the cliff effect
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
where uh individuals who if they have an
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
increase in their income
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
may find that they become ineligible for
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
certain programs yet the increase in the
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
income does not
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
outweigh what they were
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
finding helpful in benefits so
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things is looking at across
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
the eligibility programs child care snap
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
tanf for example medicaid
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
what are the eligibility requirements
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
and what happens when somebody
 
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.149 align:start position:0%
and what happens when somebody
now

01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
applies for tanf for example how is that
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
impacting their eligibility for child
 
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
impacting their eligibility for child
care

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
is there disregard of certain public
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
assistance programs
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be considered in eligibility for
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
other programs so there's a lot of
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
alignment that we really should be
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
looking at so we've started that process
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
very recently
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for that i live in
 
01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for that i live in
boston

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
boston
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
and we're a poor town
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
and when programs come come up like that
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
the first thing they say when i
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
approach them is
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to apply for that because
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to lessen my food stamps or
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get this so it's really
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
important to know that so i want to
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a question
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for considering
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
sharing that information going forward
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
and there are some of those rules or
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
some are are embedded into federal
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
regulations that we can't change so what
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
is it that we can so there are some
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria that we can look at
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
changing but we want to make sure if we
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
make a change what kind of impact is it
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
in many other aspects so we don't want
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
to do more harm than good thank you
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much thank you
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay so we're running past our time so
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hold you to the time you
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
put on your pink card jackie cowell has
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm jackie cowell from
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
early learning new hampshire
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
and the only thing i would add um or
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that this particular bill
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
really gives a legislative impromature
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
on this there's an endorsement you're
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
just saying the legislature is saying
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah let's have that plan right and and
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
it likes the excitement i do think it's
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
possible we would keep going year after
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
year without doing it even if it's even
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
though it's in an executive order
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
without the without the legislature
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
saying like this you know this is
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
important to do to have this plan
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know i would love i
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
asked the house to do the same that the
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
senate just said yes let's have this
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
plan have that have this branch of
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
government be part of saying it's
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
important to do and i do think it's
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
possible by november 2022 because
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work that people
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
will be building on over the years
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%

um it seems like a lot of
this

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:30.719 --> 01:19:32.750 align:start position:0%

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
um
integration

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
integration
 
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.430 align:start position:0%
integration
um

01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
um

promotion
and

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
promotion of parent knowledge
 
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:43.370 align:start position:0%
enhancement of interoperability
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
enhancement of interoperability
[Music]

01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
expand access
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
and improve transitions all of this was
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
in in the scope of the council for
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
thriving children and so
 
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.430 align:start position:0%
thriving children and so
um

01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
how do you see
 
01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
how do you see
the

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.709 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
office of early childhood
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
role as
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
from this or do you think that it would
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
susume all of these goals of the current
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
council i think that would um assume
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
many of the goals there and so i just
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
just to give it a little bit more
 
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.110 align:start position:0%
just to give it a little bit more
context

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
when you think of the integration that's
 
01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
when you think of the integration that's
needed

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
with um the department of health and
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
human services their their
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
joy restriction is really over the
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
family and
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
kids up to um four years old where the
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
department only has we have the children
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
from five on and this
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
works with kids b through eight and we
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
know that early interventions are the
 
01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:48.629 align:start position:0%
know that early interventions are the
best

01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
indicators for kids to be successful in
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
school and so thinking about what are
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of the gaps or some of the
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
duplications and services that we can
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
improve in this office
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
and thinking of a mixed delivery service
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
for families because each child is so
 
01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:06.149 align:start position:0%
for families because each child is so
unique

01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
unique
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
in what they need and each family is so
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
unique and what they need to be
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
successful in school and i'm thinking
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
about school and their education and
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifically when we think b through
 
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
specifically when we think b through
eight

01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about that third grade
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
reading score
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
how do we make sure that these early
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
interventions can help our children be
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
are there any further representative all
 
01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:36.070 align:start position:0%
are there any further representative all

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
chiller
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
so the executive order was issued on
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
january 23rd of 2020
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
which builds
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
it builds on the work that had already
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
begun in 2019
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there a sunset on that order the on
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
the executive order i'm not sure about
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
the executive order but i do know that
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
our grant ends this december okay of 22
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i there is whispers of an extension
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
on the grant of the money that's not
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
being funded but we can't make any plans
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
until something like that happens so
 
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
until something like that happens so
um

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
so to to that and i see some head
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
shaking that no there's not a sunset
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
happening behind you just so you know
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
the grant that is funding
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
to put together
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be up in december
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the uh plan
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
should be finished by november which
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
gives so if i'm if i'm tracking this
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
correctly as anyone who's worked with a
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
federal grant
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
you want to be done a little bit early
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that you can review
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
and also leave that room for a possible
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
extension application is that what i'm
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
hearing yes okay so this is all part of
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
reporting out the grant yes and
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
reporting to the letting the governor
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
know what our what what happens from the
 
01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
know what our what what happens from the
um

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
from our strategic plan report to him
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
and um to hopefully fulfill his
 
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
and um to hopefully fulfill his
um

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
ask in the executive order over an
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
office of early childhood thank you for
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
clarifying the timeline and the purpose
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
of this grant and why we're looking to
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
get this done by november it's not
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's not an
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
unreasonable ask because the work is
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
already happening exactly thank you
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
exactly it's been a nice blueprint laid
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
out so thank you very much for your
 
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
out so thank you very much for your
question

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question um so
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
slightly confused
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a cost to this
 
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a cost to this
but

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says that there's no
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
impact to costs i mean
 
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
impact to costs i mean
so

01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me one second just in here we're
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
about policy
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay finance worries about cost
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just i'm confused where's
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a cost that can you
 
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.550 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a cost that can you
explain

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
where that cost is coming from
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i ca so i think one like i'm going to go
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
with our madam chair that
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
right now it's what are our resources
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we have in the department of health
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
and human services what do we have in
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
department of education and what would i
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
think that the strategic plan and when
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
we work with these folks we can see
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
what's the best place for
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
the office of early childhood to sit and
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
what's probably the most fiscally
 
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:51.910 align:start position:0%
what's probably the most fiscally
responsible

01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
you and up next is anne-marie banfield
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to the pill and
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
she's bill and she's asked for three
 
01:25:04.239 --> 01:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
she's bill and she's asked for three
minutes

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is ann
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
ray banfield i'm a parental rights
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
advocate in new hampshire i tend to
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
speak at the house education and senate
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
education committees because my focus is
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
on academic excellence and education
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have any written testimony but i
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
did come here because actually you just
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
hit on my points um
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
i looked at this bill and i thought are
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
we expanding the bureaucracy as a
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
parental rights advocate i deal with
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
parents all the time
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
who have specific issues with their
 
01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
who have specific issues with their
children

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times it's not because we
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a bureaucracy it's because
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have access to what they need
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you just a for instance uh
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's been bills in in the in the
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
house education committee or senate
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
education committee focused on mental
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
health in the schools well i hear from
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
parents who have their kids
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
sitting in a hospital for a week waiting
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
on a bed to get into the one mental
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
health facility in the state and so i'm
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this going you want to spend
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
money in the schools on this but i've
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
got desperate parents whose children are
 
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.590 align:start position:0%
got desperate parents whose children are
suicidal

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
suicidal
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
and so when when you asked about the the
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's exactly what i'm
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this going are we going to be
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
spending more money on this as a state
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we have to prioritize this i'm not
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
saying that this isn't important and if
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
we had unlimited resources maybe this is
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
something that we would look at but my
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know in and the the last speakers
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
brought up you know looking at reading
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
scores well oftentimes it's because
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
schools use faulty reading programs how
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
does how does the bureaucracy fix that
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's what i would just caution
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
you on is just you know are we expanding
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
a bureaucracy with limited resources and
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the case my plea to you
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
speak to the parents speak to the people
 
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
speak to the parents speak to the people
who

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
who are trying to get access and yeah
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
maybe there are there are some hurdles
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
and you you heard that they're not going
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be removed maybe this would
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
streamline it somehow but if there is a
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
cost involved at all
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure that that's where we
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
want to be spending our money i i think

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
district 14 comprising the towns of

londonderry hudson and auburn and i have
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
this morning for your consideration
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 457
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
which as it was introduced
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
contracting with the department of
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
health and human services for children's
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
services madam chair this bill came
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
about because i was approached by
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
a number of entities
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with our department of
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
health and human services that are
 
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.750 align:start position:0%
health and human services that are
non-profits

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they're finding it very very
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to get insurance
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
for many of them their insurance has
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
been canceled
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have insurance they
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
cannot continue to do business with the
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so what um what i
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
did was put together a study committee
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
to have us take a look at this
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about giving some sort of
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
limited liability to these non-profits
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes is not a very popular thing to
 
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
sometimes is not a very popular thing to
do

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i do think we have to
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
in one way or another address this issue
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
because the state does depend upon
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits to carry out a lot of our
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
mission concerns especially concerning
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
children and we can't
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would be good policy to
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
let these organizations
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
go to the wayside just because we can't
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
seem to figure out a way to help them so
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
again this just creates a study
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this issue and come
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
forward and advise uh the legislature on
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
a path forward thank you very much madam
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
chair okay are there any questions
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.750 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.790 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the hurdle that you're you're trying
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
to find out more about is um
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
that we may not be able to continue
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
doing business with certain
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
places because they don't have insurance
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
um do we know why they don't have
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
insurance and what is the
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
or why they are getting denied or maybe
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this is maybe
 
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
that this is maybe
um

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
an insurance
 
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
an insurance
issue

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
and not um
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
like we already want to we want to be
 
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.629 align:start position:0%
like we already want to we want to be
in

01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
working with them right but they are not
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
meeting our qualifications
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
through no fault of our own but maybe
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
through the the insurance industry is
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
that um what you have come to believe um
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
it has more to do with i think a lot of
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the insurance but
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are folks here from some of those
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
organizations who would be able to
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question uh much better than
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
senator for being here today just
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
my question comes in two part
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
if i may follow up after that madam
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
chair the first part is um
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
belanger non-profit
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
is denied insurance but it would be
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
easier for belanger llc to receive that
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
but we're still providing the same
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
quality of service correct this is i
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
again representative i don't deal with
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance aspect of it they're here
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they will be able to explain their
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
experience to you much better than i can
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
got it uh thank you uh senator and if i
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
may follow up
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
just to try to comprehend what's being
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
done here but
 
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
done here but
um

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
essentially this is seeking to
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on because we
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand what's going on
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think that thank you representative i
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
think that's part of it but it's also to
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
see if we can find a path forward to
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
deal with it because we have been doing
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh business as a state with some of
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
these organizations for a for a long
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
time and now they're faced with these
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
changes and again they're the
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at the duties it says the
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee shall study the feasibility
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
of extending limited liability nonprofit
 
01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.590 align:start position:0%
of extending limited liability nonprofit
organizations

01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
organizations
so

01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
um that's what you're going to do and
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
you will bring all the players to the
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
table and hopefully
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
this committee will be able to hammer
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
out whatever we need to hammer out so we
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
all set
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative all chiller
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
senator for bringing this forward about
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
how many agencies are we talking about
 
01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:53.030 align:start position:0%
how many agencies are we talking about
um

01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i don't
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
believe we're talking so much about
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
agencies as we're talking about
 
01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.870 align:start position:0%
agencies as we're talking about
nonprofits

01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and there are some of them here who
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be able to talk about that much
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
better than i can
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
i hope i've answered your question
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh may i follow up yeah um
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
my bad for
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
using the wrong verbiage nonprofit and i
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
was thinking nonprofit agencies so my i
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
did not mean to confuse that with state
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
agencies um
 
01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
agencies um
so

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
about how many non-profits have
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
approached the state saying we're having
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
this quite frankly quite a few have
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
approached me on this particular issue
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
and in fact i was asked to bring in a
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill that would give them
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
that limited liability but we got a lot
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
of pushback from the attorneys
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
the trial attorneys and a number of
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
other organizations that just do not
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
like the idea of limited liability so
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully one of the charges of this
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee would be we're going to bring
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
these all people together all in a room
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
and hammer this out and figure out a way
 
01:33:58.159 --> 01:34:01.750 align:start position:0%
and hammer this out and figure out a way
forward

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
much madam chair
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
up next is keith keaning from waypoint
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i have dominique whitten who is
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee good to see all of you
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's been a while um my name is keith
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
king for the record i'm the advocate
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
director at waypoint um
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we want to thank senator carson for
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this bill so in
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
2019 we brought forward a similar bill
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
asking for a limited liability um we had
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
not lost our insurance yet but we were
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that either we were going to
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
lose our insurance or that the premiums
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
were going to go up so high we wouldn't
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
be able to afford it the main program
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we're focused on here is the foster
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
care program it's called iso and um
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
dominique actually works in that program
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so i thought she could give you an
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
idea of what kind of kids and what kind
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
of needs these kids have about why it is
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
so important that this program is around
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
so this year um after that bill didn't
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
go forward and i believe the word that
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
was used was they didn't think the issue
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
was ripe enough at the time um that we
 
01:35:20.159 --> 01:35:21.270 align:start position:0%
was ripe enough at the time um that we
hadn't

01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
the things that we were predicting
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
hadn't come true um now the things we
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
had predicted have come true we have
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
lost our umbrella insurance for our iso
 
01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.790 align:start position:0%
lost our umbrella insurance for our iso
program

01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
once there's not a pattern make as my
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
mother would often say but now we've
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
also found out that spaulding youth
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
center has also lost their umbrella
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
insurance and so
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think what we're seeing out there is
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the large number of lawsuits that
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
are going forward especially when it
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
comes to foster care abuse and neglect
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's happened at the sununu center
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people out there that
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
are reconsidering whether they should
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
look into suing the organizations that
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we are at a crisis point quite
 
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
and we are at a crisis point quite
honestly

01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
we work in lieu of the state we do the
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
job that the state doesn't do
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
and if the state loses us i'm not sure
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be anybody around
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
to do the work that we can do that
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean over a number of years
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
maybe the state couldn't do that um but
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
right now they can't even fill all their
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
cpsw's positions let around to go out
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
and fire hire a whole new staff to
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
replace the people that need to order to
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
do this this kind of foster care and so
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
we truly are just looking for some kind
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
of committee um we think the answer
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
might be to limit our liability to what
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
dcys liability is it's 475 thousand
 
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
dcys liability is it's 475 thousand
dollars

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you there are organizations
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
that don't agree with that perhaps
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's a better solution out there
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't know about
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
but i think bringing lawmakers and the
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
different people together to say
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
these kids need protection how do we
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
find this protection and how do we
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
continue to support organizations that
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
want to give these services would be
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
really great so um i want to thank you
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
for your time i'm happy to take
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions now or if you want to wait
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
until after dominique speaks it's
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do so thank you
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative yokola
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question when you say you've
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
lost the insurance
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
do you mean that they refused to offer
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
you insurance or that you
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
declined the premiums
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
that they offered no thank you for the
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
question they informed us
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
that they would no longer provide an
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
umbrella policy for us we do have an
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
underlying policy of a million dollars
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
which as an attorney and as most of you
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
know in this day and age that's not a
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
lot of money especially when you're
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
looking at somebody bringing a lawsuit
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
from the point where they say they're 15
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
years old and this will have damaged
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
them for the rest of their lives we have
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
been told and spaulding has been told
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
that there is no umbrella policy for you
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
we do not have an option to buy it not
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't presented to us at any cost we
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
could not get an umbrella policy
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative belanger
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%

prefacing this i too understand
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
um with the the job that i have
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
i just found out that they were just
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
canceling us because they were no longer
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
doing it um so just just and i'll ask
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
you the same question that i asked the
 
01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
you the same question that i asked the
senator

01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
senator
belanger

01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
belanger
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit is providing ex-services to
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
the state
and

01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
i get a phone call that
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
said services are no longer being
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
insured however belanger llc
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to procure that insurance is is
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
that what's going on here
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i i have
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
no idea whether that that we i think
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is one of the reasons we would like
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
to have the committee to see where the
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
impact from these cancellations are
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
happening again that may be a solution i
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know all i can tell you is the
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
two non-profits that we know and
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
spalding is a pretty big organization
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
and they are very concerned about this i
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think the thing you have to understand
 
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:10.709 align:start position:0%
i think the thing you have to understand
is

01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
the children that we take
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the children that spalding takes
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is like juggling nitroglycerin
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
these kids have been through hell right
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
you are you're you're bringing and
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking care of kids that are incredibly
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
damaged and so when we take them on as a
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
client we're trying to solve problems
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
but it's very difficult for us not to
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
get pulled into things because these
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
kids have so many issues but whether we
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
could somehow part of us go back under
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
an llc or whether the private
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
corporations that provide this are
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting better insurance or whatever i'm
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
not sure representative but i think it
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be something that we need to have
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
answered and again i think the committee
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to pull people in we'd be
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
able to get the answers to this and then
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
as i've said before i don't think we're
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're just looking for one solution if
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
the cap is not the solution that's fine
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
with us we just want to be able to
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
provide the services to these children
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
that need it
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
and that's our goal
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you i don't know if that
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
i would have to say i'd have to look
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
into that deeper representative
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what was the
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance canceling you what did
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
they say did they say any any reason
 
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.229 align:start position:0%
they say did they say any any reason
so

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:40:27.119 --> 01:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
they don't tell you why they're i'm
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
pulling the umbrella policy i will tell
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
you that this is
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
since all these things have started
 
01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
since all these things have started
happening

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.229 align:start position:0%
happening
um

01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
more and more people are coming forward
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
i think they just think it's just too
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
huge of a liability for them to take
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
this on and they'd rather just walk away
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
from it than to possibly get on the hook
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
for um a verdict that could leave them
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
millions and millions and millions of
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
dollars that they have to pay out um as
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
i said you know when these kids are i
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
think some of you remember back there
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
was a case where
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know two kids were taking into the
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
bathroom by their parents this was i
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe this was an iso one but
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
those children were sexual excuse me it
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
was a parent parent but those children
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
were sexually abused by the parents
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
during that
 
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
during that
incident

01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe the payout was someplace
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the seven million dollar range so i
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
think a lot of these i think a lot of
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
these insurance companies are just
 
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.189 align:start position:0%
these insurance companies are just
saying

01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know what these kids are really
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
damaged to begin with and we're just not
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to take the risk of going you know
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
right you can't buy flood insurance near
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
the ocean that has to be a federal
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
program because most of the insurance
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
companies say it's just too dangerous
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where we are we
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
didn't get an explanation but i can i
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you that's what's going on
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative ocala thank you
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:41:58.239 --> 01:41:59.669 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
you are wanting
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the study of
 
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.109 align:start position:0%
the study of
um

01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:07.119 --> 01:42:08.470 align:start position:0%
um
specific

01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
the non-profit organizations that deal
 
01:42:12.719 --> 01:42:13.669 align:start position:0%
the non-profit organizations that deal
with

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
the contract with department of human
 
01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.709 align:start position:0%
the contract with department of human
services

01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
all non-profit organizations having the
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
option to be
 
01:42:22.239 --> 01:42:24.149 align:start position:0%
option to be
um

01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
be a limited liability and then i
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand how you would
 
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand how you would
um

01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
um
know

01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
before you've made your declaration of
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
like this is my business and this is my
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
type of business how would you qualify
 
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
type of business how would you qualify
for

01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
like if you're not allowing all
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
non-profits to be limited liability then
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
you would apply after you form the
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
business you start doing good work then
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
you contract with uh
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
with dhhs and say okay now you want you
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
want to hire us to do this work now
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to get limited liability
 
01:43:03.119 --> 01:43:04.229 align:start position:0%
we're going to get limited liability
like

01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
like
um

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
in a different class classification than
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
do you see that that is
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
like like a restructuring of the
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
business like midstream
 
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
business like midstream
as

01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
something that is problematic and you
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
would really think that you should be
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
allowing all uh
 
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.709 align:start position:0%
allowing all uh
um

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
non-profits to have limited liability or
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
are you really just seeking a special
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
like reformation of the business once
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
they get a contract with dhhs
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
sir so if it's all right dominique would
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
like to so
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of the problem that's coming up
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
with the insurance is because iso and
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
child placing agencies are working
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
directly with the state
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
and because of dcyf's history and
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice's history and the level
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
of risk that these children are exposed
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
to when they're not placed with their
 
01:44:04.159 --> 01:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
to when they're not placed with their
parents

01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's putting a lot of burden on our
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
programs to go and do
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of extra work and verification
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
as far as uh an iso agency being
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
for-profit or not-for-profit my personal
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
opinion and this is not the opinion of
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not representing waypoint when i say
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
this the service needs to take place
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
these children need the help
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
and so if we're putting the service
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
providers at a higher level of risk for
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
taking this work from the state because
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
the state has a cap and we don't
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're not only putting ourselves in
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
danger when we're walking into
 
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
danger when we're walking into
homes

01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
that have significant child welfare
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
concerns significant safety concerns but
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're also putting
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
our agencies at a higher level of risk
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
because we can't control all of the
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes we don't have decision making
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
power and i can reflect a little bit
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
more on that in my testimony but really
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
what's happening is we're being made
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for decisions that aren't
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
ours to make
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
well it would be all right if i answered
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
the question also madam chair yeah
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
so representative i mean if we said that
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to expand it to all nonprofits
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think every non-profit in the state
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
would cheer i also think you'd have so
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
many trial attorneys in here we wouldn't
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
be able to breathe so i think what we've
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
learned over the years is that we try
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to i've talked to
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
marissa we've talked to people from the
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
trial attorneys
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
i think good legislation comes from
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
solving the problem in front of you we
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too broad
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
and and what we're bringing to you
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
is what's happening to one particular
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
program at this particular moment and i
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
i i think what i've learned over my past
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
10 years of advocacy is not to try to go
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
beyond that too far because then you're
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
solving problems that don't exist and so
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i think you have to understand there
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
are different programs with different
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
levels of liability and risk and this
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
program the reason the insurance
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
companies have stopped this insurance is
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
because the risk on this program is so
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly high because the children
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
have been through so such terrible
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i guess what i'm saying to you is i'm
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
sure the non-profit community would love
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
to have their liability limited to 475
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
but we have tried to explain it to
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
everybody we've talked to including the
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
trial attorneys we're asking for
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
something very specific here on this
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
particular program where the state hires
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
us in lieu of their efforts we need
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
protection because we no longer have an
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
umbrella policy and that's all we're
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.639 --> 01:46:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
with

01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
is there any possibilities that
 
01:46:59.119 --> 01:46:59.910 align:start position:0%
is there any possibilities that
in

01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
high risk situations such as this
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
you could pay the premium to the state
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
to cover
you

01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know thank you representative it's a
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
great question i mean i think some of us
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
i reflect back on i believe this
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
happened to the
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
ob gyns years ago right where they had
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
this established some kind of state fund
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
because they were having difficulty
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
finding reasonable insurance as i said
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the testimony we
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
came up with the solution
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
saying to limit our liability there may
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
be a better solution through this
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
through this through the insurance
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
department and we'd love to sit down
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
with the trial attorneys and others and
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
try to find the solution all we're
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
asking we're trying to find a solution
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
that keeps our program open
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
to keep helping the children
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's our bottom line that's all we
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
want to achieve and if there's different
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
ways to achieve that we are more than
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to hear what those are and there
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
may be other solutions and if the state
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
would like to get involved in that way
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that would be fine too
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
can i ask you a question
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
so um dominique was just going to tell
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
you just about some of the children that
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
are in this program would you like her
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
to expand on that or since the questions
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
have gone on so long that's up to you
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair she was just going to tell
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
you would you mind just just telling
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
them no go ahead is that all right oh
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right so iso services are
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
wrap around services for families that
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
are involved in child welfare to the
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
extent that they are either at imminent
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
risk of placement
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
or they've already received a finding we
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
work with
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in juvenile justice
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we work with families that are
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
involved with child welfare
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
the services that we provide um
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
their intention is to prevent
 
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.629 align:start position:0%
their intention is to prevent
institutionalization

01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
institutionalization
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
their intention is to make sure that the
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
family has an opportunity to reunify
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
and if the family can't reunify the
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
child has the the ability to build
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
trusting relationships with adults so
 
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
that they don't wind up in a long-term
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
institutionalization situation
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
we do some pretty life-saving work both
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
and with their parents
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
for parents a lot of our work is to
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
address safety barriers to them like
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
substance abuse domestic violence
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
significant criminal activity
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then for the children we're working
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
with children who have been put
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
significantly at risk i've worked with
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
children who have fallen from windows
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
several stories up i've worked with
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
children who have
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
experienced firearms
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
being let off in the home
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i've also worked with children
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
who've gone through some really
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
traumatic loss
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
related to domestic violence and all of
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
these children are serious by these
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
programs regardless of who they are all
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
there is a really good reason that this
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
service isn't provided by the state of
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that is that the state
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire as we've all heard
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner ribson say is a law
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency child protective
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
services and juvenile justice and
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
probation their job is to make decisions
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to impact the lives of
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
these children our job is to provide
 
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.470 align:start position:0%
these children our job is to provide
treatment

01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
and our job is to provide them with the
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
information that they need to make a
 
01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:27.669 align:start position:0%
information that they need to make a
choice

01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:50:27.679 --> 01:50:29.589 align:start position:0%
choice
um

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
asking the state to take on that work
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
really disrupts the trust it reduces
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
clinically evident practices and
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
services and it would likely reduce the
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time that these children and
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
these families are getting from their
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
and just lastly and i promise i won't
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
say another thing unless i'm asked
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
i think the difference between foster
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
care and what dominique does is foster
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
care they might check in on them once a
 
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.910 align:start position:0%
care they might check in on them once a
month

01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
literally iso programs they're they're
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
checked in five times a week that's how
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
much care these kids need that they have
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
an entire staff of people coming in to
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
talk to these kids and help these kids
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i keep saying these
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
kids are at the deep end of need and
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so hard to
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
how how desperately we need to protect
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
them so i will stop there but thank you
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
for your time everyone are there any
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing them thanks so much
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
and up next is marissa chase from the
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair morning still
 
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair morning still
yes

01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
i represent the new hampshire
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
association for justice which is a
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
statewide organization of professional
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
trial attorneys so we are the trial
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys that have been mentioned i
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning to testify today
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know we we support the concept of a
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee to study these issues rather
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
than the blanket
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know liability protection that was
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
suggested in 2020 we vehemently oppose
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
as drafted because it's so expansive you
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
know when you're talking about taking
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
away liability that's really taking away
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
accountability and as we heard these
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
kids are in high risk scenarios
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of points i just
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make one
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have met with keith would love to
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
continue speaking with keith and folks
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
at waypoint
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
i believe and keith can correct me if
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong there are about 10
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state that
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently provide iso iso services
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
it is no doubt been proven by data since
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
the 1930s that kids who are in bad homes
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
do better staying in those homes and
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
getting services like iso than they do
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
going and being institutionalized
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the problem we have is that
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
if you take if you
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot write any one specific entity
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
into statute so
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
while waypoint i believe from our
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
research has only been named in a
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit once in the past 10 years the
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
other organizations have been named
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
much more often
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and there are some really troubling
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
facts out there so we're trying to
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
find a way that iso services can still
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
be provided without granting immunity to
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
these other organizations who may
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
provide iso services but are also
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in negligent hiring and their
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
staff are abusing children
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i understand it's a tricky balance to
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
make it's you know i s no doubt that iso
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
is a very um important
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
function for about i think it's between
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
130 130 to 150 families a year but 130
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
to 150 families a year versus thousands
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
of kids
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
in other placement entities
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
run by some of these same organizations
 
01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.310 align:start position:0%
run by some of these same organizations
so

01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to provide follow up with
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
with some of our concerns but again
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
we like the idea of a study committee to
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
really get down to the heart of these
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
issues and be able to have those
 
01:54:11.679 --> 01:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
issues and be able to have those
conversations

01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um it is it possible you may
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer it but i think
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
your trial attorneys may uh
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
is it a possibility for the state to
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
contract the insurance for these high
 
01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.589 align:start position:0%
contract the insurance for these high
risk

01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:54:33.599 --> 01:54:34.950 align:start position:0%
risk
entities

01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
i did a survey
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
through our national organization to
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
find out if this has been approached in
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
other states you know this idea of
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
limiting liability for these private
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
placement entities i could not find any
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
any surrounding states that have been um
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking into that as a possibility so i
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that if there's like a
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
blueprint out there for that i just
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:55:07.199 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about um
 
01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:12.709 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about um
these

01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:55:12.719 --> 01:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
these
um

01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
maybe not waypoint but
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
other companies um
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
being held liable for their employees
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
doing things that were inappropriate
 
01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.350 align:start position:0%
doing things that were inappropriate
um

01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
it see
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
the question um that waypoint is trying
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
to address is
 
01:55:37.599 --> 01:55:38.709 align:start position:0%
to address is
um

01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
may have happened that are outside their
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
control and not actually
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily that they're trying
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
to shirk responsibility for what they've
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
done but for things that they haven't
 
01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
done but for things that they haven't
done

01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that maybe decisions were made by
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
the state or a different person they
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
were just there
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
right and and they
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
were not law enforcement so they can't
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
can't do you know arrest someone or
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
something like that that's creating some
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
some hazard but may
 
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.430 align:start position:0%
some hazard but may
may

01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they don't handle it correctly be
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
held liable for
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be possible
 
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be possible
to

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
limit the liability of things that they
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't have direct control over without
 
01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
don't have direct control over without
creating

01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh the light the protection for things
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
that they are doing that are imp
 
01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.669 align:start position:0%
that they are doing that are imp
incorrect

01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i will start i'm trying to get my
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts here um
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's a legal principle called
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
responded superior
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
that means when
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
a business
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
you assume responsibility for your
 
01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:56.390 align:start position:0%
you assume responsibility for your
employees

01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
and that's a way for the business to
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are you know meeting
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
all the you know licensing requirements
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
requirements or accountability that are
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
out there you know they're in compliance
 
01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.390 align:start position:0%
out there you know they're in compliance
um

01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
so the way to change a bad actor
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
is to hold them accountable
 
01:57:15.599 --> 01:57:16.550 align:start position:0%
is to hold them accountable
um

01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
so even though
 
01:57:18.159 --> 01:57:19.270 align:start position:0%
so even though
um

01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
keith at waypoint may not be directly
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
something that goes on in a home
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know the organization is responsible
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
for their activities
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
i will also say it is very difficult to
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
bring any of these lawsuits there's a
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
court rule superior court rule 40 that
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
caps attorney's fees at 25 when they're
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
representing children um that is not
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
great incentive for any lawyer to bring
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
these cases because these cases are
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
taken on contingency fee that means that
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
the lawyer fronts all the costs of
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
litigation up front and only gets paid
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
if and when they are successful and
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
again their fees will be capped so the
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
attorneys that take these cases are
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
really um
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's out of a public interest
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
um i could think of one attorney who's a
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
former public defender who has taken a
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
few of these cases against these private
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
placement facilities only when there is
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
criminal conduct found and it's been
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
referred to him by a public interest
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer that says hey like
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is really bad what's going on here
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
can you take a look
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that directly answered
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
your question our concern with the
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation introduced in 2020 was that
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
the way it was drafted it would apply to
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
anyone who contracts with the state so
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
someone joked oh if pinara caters an
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
executive council meeting can they will
 
01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.070 align:start position:0%
executive council meeting can they will
they

01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
be granted limited liability so i
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a very careful
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
balancing act that needs to take place
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to a greater
 
01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to a greater
discussion

01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i answered your question
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
saying no representative smith
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
you your the iso works directly with
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
dcyf correct
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't work for
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
um the iso
 
01:59:15.599 --> 01:59:16.629 align:start position:0%
um the iso
okay

01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah so i was just wondering
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't fall under that dcyf
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.159 --> 01:59:29.109 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
no come on up more the more the merrier
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
from your mouth to god's ear
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
well there's your answer
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know i think i i i do think
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the trial attorneys have
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
a point
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think this goes back to what
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative was saying too we're
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
being pulled into things
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
because of what other things are
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
happening around us and that's affecting
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
our ability to serve these kids and i i
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
think marissa
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
we have that very you know civilized
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
conversations and i look forward to
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
having those also but i think the
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
question becomes how do you solve this
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
problem perhaps just in this iso and let
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
me make very clear
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
we are not asking this just for waypoint
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're asking for iso you know iso
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
programs so right
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me i'm sorry could you speak into
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
the mic sir so that it's
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
so people listening at home
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
on you marissa can i have a follow-up
 
02:00:24.639 --> 02:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
on you marissa can i have a follow-up
um

02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
how does the child get services from you
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
once dcyf is
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
involved correct they refer they refer
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
the family okay so i just i was just
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could be under their
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
umbrella where your contract you're kind
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
of contracted by them
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
so that thank you for the question that
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
is what we're requesting that if we're
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
if we're working in lieu of the state
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
and contracting with the state on a
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
particular iso programs
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
and if if the other bill was
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
too broad we're asking for a narrower
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
definition now is that per because of
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
the high risk of these children that we
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
would have our liability limited to the
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
state on those pro on that particular
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
program and not just for waypoint but
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
for any agency that deals with these
 
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
for any agency that deals with these
kids

02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you answer your question yes
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and madam chair if i may just
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
one last comment um
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about people getting
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
pulled into other lawsuits there is a
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
practice where you know it's not just
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff attorneys just going out
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
naming everyone there's a case that has
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
become great precedent called the
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
benedetto and keith and i have talked
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
about that before and that's where to
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
shift the burden of liability defendants
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
will name co-defendants because they try
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
to spread out responsibility so that
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
they are not accountable solely so
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff attorneys aren't always the
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
bad guys i guess is what i'm trying to
 
02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:55.350 align:start position:0%
bad guys i guess is what i'm trying to
say

02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay we'll take note of that thank you
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm gonna close the public
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
hearing i'm
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
so next week we have scheduled
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
three bills
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
that and then i am hopeful that after
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%

judicial branch and it's also
 
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
a workforce bill because by doing this
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
cleanup more family mediators can be
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
trained and go through internships so i
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put that on the record

and i will
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
follow with my introduction so the
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%

03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%

in order to become a certified family
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
mediator a student must complete an
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
internship however the pathway to these
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
internships needs to be cleared as the
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
absence of official language recognizing
 
03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
these qualified interns and that's
 
03:03:23.349 --> 03:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
defined under rsa 328 c 5 1
 
03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
and 2 a and c as part of the proceedings
 
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
has become a barrier so what they're
 
03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
saying is in these sections without this
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
proper definition we can't have these
 
03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:35.110 align:start position:0%
proper definition we can't have these
qualified

03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%

03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.279 --> 03:03:46.389 align:start position:0%

hester
 
03:03:49.750 --> 03:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
they can provide further clarification
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation would go far for
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
solving the problem by opening up these
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
internship opportunities and officially
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing interns in the proceedings
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
as required by the judicial branch i
 
03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
asked the committee for your support on
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
and on to pass motion or on past
 
03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation i should say
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
and this was amended in the senate and
 
03:04:12.150 --> 03:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that was made by
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary had to do with making
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure that interns these qualified
 
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
interns they couldn't be alone
 
03:04:21.510 --> 03:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
in a proceeding or alone in a room they
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
had to have you know restrict
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
supervision and that was a again an
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that was made by senate um
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%

03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay are there any
questions

03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you very
 
03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:53.590 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you very
much

03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
the program um
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
the program exists now yes and um this
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
is there an expectation that with
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
further clarification our program will
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
be more attractive
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know i the program is it our
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
mediation program um certainly has a
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
large number of participants um there
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
was 1800 i believe family law mediations
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the past year
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
this is really to allow
 
03:06:26.230 --> 03:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
folks to obtain the training by
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
participating in those mediations so
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that um they're then able to conduct
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
them themselves so i see the jewish
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
branch only sees it as a positive thing
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it'll be more
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
mediations but it may be more trained
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
mediators and that's always a good thing
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
if we grow our capacity for
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
family mediators by expanding on this
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
internship program um
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
will that pave the way for further
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities here to keep those interns
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
as state residents doing mediation maybe
 
03:07:14.230 --> 03:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
i i would see that as certainly a
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
benefit to this to this program as well
 
03:07:17.200 --> 03:07:17.910 align:start position:0%
benefit to this to this program as well
i'm

03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
sure that the sponsor and the committee
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
could could speak to that but from the
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
court perspective we welcome
 
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the intern and the and the
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your time
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
up next is honey hastings
 
03:07:41.830 --> 03:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
is a family mediator correct
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
she's asked for five minutes and does
 
03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
have written testimony and she is also
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
passing out testimony from someone who
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.309 --> 03:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:28.630 --> 03:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
there you go is that it yeah good thank
 
03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:29.349 align:start position:0%
there you go is that it yeah good thank
you

03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:08:29.359 --> 03:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
you
um

03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's new
 
03:08:33.750 --> 03:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't been here in person since that
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
happened it's a good it's a plus i've
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
been watching you
 
03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
and other committees of interest
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
my name's honey hastings i'm a retired
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer and i've been a mediator uh
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
certified mediator since 2000.
 
03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:49.429 align:start position:0%
certified mediator since 2000.
i

03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
the problem is that people are having
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
trouble getting internship hours and
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
thus they don't become certified
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
they do not then
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
be able to offer their services to the
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
court who
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
screens people and chooses the people
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
they want but there's a smaller pool
 
03:09:13.349 --> 03:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
03:09:13.359 --> 03:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
because of this
problem

03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
problem
and

03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
when the court indicated the reason that
 
03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
they changed the policy and said that
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
interns could not work in the co-mediate
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the system was some changes were
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
needed in the statute
 
03:09:32.550 --> 03:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
well you know me
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
changes in the statute
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a solvable
 
03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a solvable
problem

03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:09:39.429 --> 03:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
and with
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
your support added to that we got in the
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary this problem will be
 
03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary this problem will be
solved

03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
solved
 
03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
solved
um

03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
at this point they're only interns only
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to observe
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
so there's the shortage of people and um
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
in fact there are two emails that i
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
think you got one from linda bauer was a
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker and she got the
 
03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker and she got the
training

03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
but she couldn't get the internship
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
hours so she is not a certified mediator
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
and it would have been her particular
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
background skills would have been a nice
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the profession
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe when the bill passes she'll be
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
able to do that there's also susannah
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
schweitzer sent in an email it took her
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
more than a year to get the internship
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
hours she did succeed in doing it and is
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
now certified
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
so there's the numbers thing there's
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
qualified people being able to get the
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
internships and thus
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
be able to do the court work but there's
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
also court cases are different in my
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
experience i did court work for a lot of
 
03:10:45.439 --> 03:10:47.830 align:start position:0%
experience i did court work for a lot of
years

03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're often tougher cases
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
private mediation people haven't filed
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
court papers haven't started making
 
03:10:57.590 --> 03:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
charges back and forth haven't had court
 
03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
charges back and forth haven't had court
events

03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
events
 
03:10:58.640 --> 03:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
events
um

03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
and they're often
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
not as antagonistic towards each other
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
people have been in court have had a
 
03:11:08.710 --> 03:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
losing decision and a temporary hearing
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then sent to mediation
 
03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
and then sent to mediation
um

03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
they're tougher they're tougher and also
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's more cases where the parties
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
were never married to each other
 
03:11:20.710 --> 03:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
i don't if only had very few private
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
cases with that scenario most of them
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
are divorces and somehow those never
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
married cases are tougher
 
03:11:30.070 --> 03:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
maybe they only had a brief dating
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
relationship you know they have no good
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
times to look back on
 
03:11:33.840 --> 03:11:34.870 align:start position:0%
times to look back on
so

03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
not having the experience with the court
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
the mix of court cases is a disadvantage
 
03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
um i think in addition to just the
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
number of of people become coming in
 
03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
this this bill is a product of a
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee called the future of certified
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
family medias that was set up by the
 
03:11:55.349 --> 03:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
chair of the new hampshire conflict
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
resolution association because
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
we were all talking about it within the
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
profession and it it seemed like it was
 
03:12:04.150 --> 03:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
something that it would be hard for the
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
board itself to take on there
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
especially because as i'll speak later
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble with quorums
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
so we went off a bunch of us that were
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
interested in policy and came up with it
 
03:12:16.720 --> 03:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
interested in policy and came up with it
um

03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
it essentially breaks down the
 
03:12:21.990 --> 03:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
internship into two steps
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
all the steps for becoming certified
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
other than the internship are step one
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you get all those papers and courses
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
and training in and the board reviews it
 
03:12:36.630 --> 03:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
you can become a qualified intern a new
 
03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:38.229 align:start position:0%
you can become a qualified intern a new
term

03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
you then have to get the internship
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
hours and only when you add the
 
03:12:45.190 --> 03:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
internship hours to the paperwork
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
and training
 
03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
can you
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
possibly become a certified mediator by
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
breaking it down the court is assured
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the people that are being brought
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
in as interns have
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
the suitable training and education and
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
background check etc all the things that
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
have to happen other than the internship
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it may even lead to if
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill passes to more mediators being
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
willing to take on interns because they
 
03:13:14.469 --> 03:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
will also be reassured
 
03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
that the qualified interns have already
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that this
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
will have a very positive effect on the
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
availability of
 
03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:28.469 align:start position:0%
availability of
mediators

03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
mediators
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
the next to last paragraph in the bill
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
was something that was also added in the
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
senate and it's because the board has
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
had a continuing quorum problem in fact
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
the board was to meet today
 
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it's not because it's lacking a
 
03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
and it's not because it's lacking a
quorum

03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
the occupational many occupational
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards had their statutes
 
03:13:53.590 --> 03:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
amended to replace a number for a quorum
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
to the language that says a majority of
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
the members of the board appointed by
 
03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
governor and council shall constitute a
 
03:14:00.319 --> 03:14:02.469 align:start position:0%
governor and council shall constitute a
quorum

03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
somehow they didn't get this magic
 
03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
language in for the mediator board
 
03:14:09.349 --> 03:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
the mediator board needs it because it's
 
03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
got two
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
members that are appointed by the
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact one of them can't attend
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
today and it's the reason why there's no
 
03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
today and it's the reason why there's no
quorum

03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
so if you would simply add that
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
you know that's a kind of it's a small
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
minor issue and yet the board repeatedly
 
03:14:29.110 --> 03:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
has not been able to have its meetings
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
due to lack and this is why we asked the
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
senate to add this and they did
 
03:14:34.399 --> 03:14:35.510 align:start position:0%
senate to add this and they did
um

03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to review
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
of course i answer any questions i'd be
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
happy to review the sections of the bill
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
if people want
 
03:14:43.359 --> 03:14:44.229 align:start position:0%
if people want
that

03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
whatever would be helpful
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:55.030 align:start position:0%

03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
supervisor and trainer
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
hello everyone good afternoon thank you
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
for your time um and all you give to the
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:15:23.349 --> 03:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
i actually see no downside to this
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i've been mediating
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually since we were certifying family
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
meteors in in new hampshire and so which
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
is back in the early 90s and
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think the re specific to the
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the the legislation
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
and i think really an important piece is
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
being able to create the level of and
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
volume of opportunities for people to
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
intern with with um certified family
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
mediators a lot of whom um are court
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
contracted i do i do i have a private
 
03:15:59.429 --> 03:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
practice with the business partner but
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
honestly the bulk of work that we do for
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
a lot less money than if we're in
 
03:16:05.670 --> 03:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
private cases is with the court and
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
those can be some of the most
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
challenging cases which frankly
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
interests me and
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
our goal in general as professional
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
mediators is to try to provide the
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
highest level of of services to our
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
community here in new hampshire and
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
where else you know we may serve people
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and to do that is to be able to
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunities for more
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
internships and more um hands-on active
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
if appropriate co-mediation comedian
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
observation is you sit and watch and you
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i i have used this before and you
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
know anyone who's in the room with me i
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't care who they are signs of
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
participation agreement and
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
it takes the pledge of confidentiality
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
frankly i think it's always been that
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
way but i think we need to reassure
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
people about that um
 
03:16:56.479 --> 03:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
people about that um
um

03:16:57.670 --> 03:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know when when so i i do think that
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
once people take the program of
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
instruction which is part of that first
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
component um and they have to work
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
really hard to find in i you know
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
internships i i my i do have interns i
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
have a couple now so and other people do
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
as well including my business partner
 
03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
but but um a lot of people have found
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
that they've gotten turned down and
 
03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that where no one gets paid
 
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
more than a modest amount for any court
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
case it might be easier for some of the
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
certified meteors to feel like they can
 
03:17:34.870 --> 03:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
take on an intern
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
as part of that process
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
but i came from mediation this morning
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
over in brentwood and you know it was um
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
and it reminds me why do what i do and
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
and because people are coming in at the
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
one of the hardest times and they need
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
help getting apart so whether you're
 
03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:52.550 align:start position:0%
help getting apart so whether you're
the

03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
therapist who honey mentioned uh linda
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
brewer who and and i know her i trained
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
her and frankly she's doing some
 
03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
internship time with me at the moment
 
03:18:03.269 --> 03:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
but only under observation and i'm
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for my next private case
 
03:18:09.190 --> 03:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
but um i think that those are just
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
in general more challenging you know i i
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're dealing with millionaires
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
or people who who come in and know
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to pay and can't
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
and you have to learn to deal with all
 
03:18:21.830 --> 03:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
those things with professionally and and
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
grace and
 
03:18:25.030 --> 03:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
um i think that there are more
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do that through the
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
i can only see this as a bonus right
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to get more mediators we
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
already know we're short on them which
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
is causing more problems in the back up
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the courts
 
03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:44.229 align:start position:0%
of the courts
correct

03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely it's better i just
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
had to perform it into questions
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah oh okay okay hold on so
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
honestly i've been mediating um in and
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
out of the courts since the mid-80s and
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
i meeting probably in most counties and
 
03:19:03.750 --> 03:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
most courts and i on occasion used to
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
get called from a court saying hey hey
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
who's this person who's like does this
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
mediation and and because they had some
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
people who especially some of the
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
parenting cases and the post-divorce
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
cases where they're truly high conflict
 
03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
no communication cases and there's a
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
huge need and it's why i've chosen to
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
focus on family and you know some
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate as well family from kind of
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
pre-birth to to death cases because it's
 
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
so important and it helps de-escalate
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
situations to help parents do what they
 
03:19:36.309 --> 03:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
which so anyways but yes there is a real
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
need for it and and there is a shortage
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
and i do hope that more people will take
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
on interns you know with the passing of
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation so
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
all right great thank you so much thank
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
you so much okay so that was my last
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
pink card so i'm going to close the
 
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
house the
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.439 --> 03:20:37.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.359 --> 03:21:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i tell those kind of cases
