foreign

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
all right seeing that it's uh now past
 
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
10 uh I'm going to open the hearing on
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
SB 15 FN
 
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to look to representative
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I was gonna make a motion sorry
 
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
represent a Cobalt for a motion uh OTP
 
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 15. okay and I'm going to
 
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
look for a second on that representative
 
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
two seconds
 
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
all right it's now uh OTP and open for
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm going to offer
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
and look for a second I will second
 
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 align:start position:0%
so we now have uh
 
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to discuss this amendment
 
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you that what this
 
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
amendment does is essentially remove the
 
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
written portion of the permission making
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
it just plain permission you can have it
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
in writing or verbal however you want
 
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
um because we did hear testimony that
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
um some landowners may be hesitant to
 
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.770 align:start position:0%
um some landowners may be hesitant to
give

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
permission in writing because they think
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're taking on extra liability even
 
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
though they would be exempt from
 
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
liability but
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
I can see where there's a gray area on
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
that because you could if somebody comes
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
on your property hunting
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
when you're not don't have it posted
 
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
they are the the owner is exempt from
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
liability if they hurt themselves but if
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
you as a landowner invite someone onto
 
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
your property now there's a gray area
 
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
and and is that written permission an
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
invitation it could be considered such
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the court so I can see why some
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
landowners may want to just give verbal
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
permission I look at it as it's up to
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the hunter if he wants to be in it he
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
said she said situation he really wants
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
to hunt the land uh he or she and and
 
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
there's uh if they want to hunt that
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
land in this and they're not going to
 
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
get written permission but they're
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
giving verbal permission it's up to them
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
to make that decision so uh written came
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
out verbal only or verbal or written up
 
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
to up to the landowner
 
00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.409 align:start position:0%
to up to the landowner
um

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
what else did I put in the air uh change
 
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
instead of January 1st which gives them
 
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
more than 16 days I mean the archery
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
season ends on December 15th and then if
 
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
it has to be down by January 1st that's
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
really only 16 days for a hunter to go
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
gather all their tree stands in whatever
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
weather those 16 days throw at them in
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
December uh I think we kind of all can
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
agree that's not a safe situation to
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
send someone out climbing a tree in in
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
December to pull stands down
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so April 1st I think is a good date
 
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.029 align:start position:0%
um so April 1st I think is a good date
um

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
we still kept the uh name and contact
 
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.850 align:start position:0%
we still kept the uh name and contact
information

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
needing to be put on the stand or blind
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
that allows say if the Timberland
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
Association one of their members is
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
going out to do a cut and they see a
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
tree stands there they at least know how
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
to contact
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
have it taken down
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I've added the whole section on who
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
who's allowed to remove the tree stand
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
because that was missing from here
 
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.969 align:start position:0%
because that was missing from here
um

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
there was there was no
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
the camera Bill had a clause about who's
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to remove it so we I just took
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
that same paragraph from the camera Bill
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
and put it in here so that we have
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
actually said that fish and game will
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
remove it or direct the owner and we
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
heard from the colonel that if Fish and
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
Game instructs the owner then that
 
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
removes liability from the owner for
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
damage because they've been told been
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
directed by Fish and Game so that's in
 
00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 align:start position:0%
there now
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
and effective date chance to January 1st
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
because we know that we can't do a
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
shorter effective date when rules have
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
did I miss anything
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
I think that's it
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
so is there any other discussion on the
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
amendment questions or comments
 
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
I think this is yeah there it is
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um concerning the
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
um taking down of the tree stand on
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
April 1st instead of
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
um at the end of December beginning of
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.409 align:start position:0%
um at the end of December beginning of
January

00:07:59.409 --> 00:07:59.419 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me how tree stands
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
are attached I had a phone call from a
 
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:08.300 align:start position:0%
constituent who is concerned because
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're attached by webbing
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
and leaving them up through the winter
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
the webbing might rot and then when you
 
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
go to stand on the tree stand it can
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
fall and you can get hurt and Sue the
 
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419 align:start position:0%
landowner can somebody clarify that for
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
me please
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
I have many tree stands and uh it really
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of tree stand if
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
it's a climbing stand it's usually a
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
cable a plastic wrapped steel cable
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
not always but it usually is if you are
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
using a
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
ladder type tree stand that typically
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
has ratchet straps and those are weather
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
resistant and good form many years I can
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
tell you I've had the tree stand in
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
place on lands that I have permission to
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
hunt that's been up for
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
three years I checked the webbing of the
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
strap the uh the ratchet strap every
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
year and loosen it and adjust it as
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
needed with the tree growth replace it
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
when necessary but that's a standard
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
part of having the tree stand and
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
keeping your stand in in good working
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
condition it does not degrade over one
 
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.190 align:start position:0%
condition it does not degrade over one
winter

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
if somebody else has a different opinion
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
I certainly would entertain it but
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's what I would answer that
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Hill
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
my feeling with ratchet straps I've I've
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
used them for years A lot of it depends
 
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.430 align:start position:0%
used them for years A lot of it depends
on

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
the UV so if it's on one side of the
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
tree versus another it may have
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
different uh characteristics of how long
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
they last so maybe that's some part of
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
it I don't know but UV seems to be the
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
 
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.610 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
questions

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes I was uh interested in section 4
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
line 14.
 
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
line 14.
um

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and really it's on line 15 the permittee
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
shall carry such a permit on this person
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a verbal or not
 
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.150 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a verbal or not
written

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
so I can help you with this we're adding
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
the new information into current law and
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
current law as you can see already
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
requires written for anything permanent
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
anything that punctures a tree or a pit
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
blind or blind that has been dug into
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
the ground or uses cut trees
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
um where we've added the new section
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
that requires permission but not
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily written permission only for
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
those portable tree stands and blinds so
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
there is still a need to tell them about
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
carrying written permission if they have
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
it for those other instances where they
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
may have a permanent tree stand or blind
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%

representative Reed
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so uh I've been
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat torn about this I am a complete
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
believer in the ability for people to
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
maintain their privacy I do understand
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to necessarily move
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
to the Midwest Model I believe also in
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire model of
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
until a land is posted treating private
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
land as public land because that I don't
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
believe in anybody who knows me knows
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
this uh I don't believe in complete
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
power given to people on the basis
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
solely of what they own
 
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.650 align:start position:0%
solely of what they own
however

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to work on this
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
further because I am I'm very concerned
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
about privacy and especially
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
um into the extent that people might be
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
stalked they might have I mean there's
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
more than More Creeps than I would like
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
in the world and that's something that
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
concerns me so I think we need to work
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
further on this
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Tudor
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I should speak to my motion for a
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
second is that we have doing amendments
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
we have displaying Amendment and we have
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
the goal the amendment I just think that
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
we had a work session with later in the
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
term uh we could look at the good points
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
of both these amendments and try to
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
merge them into a single Amendment we
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
kind of have the issue of does the Honda
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
need permission from the landowner to
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
put up a camera or does the landowner
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
have to post his land to say I don't
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
want you to put up a camera and in a big
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
issue with I think needs to be resolved
 
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.610 align:start position:0%
issue with I think needs to be resolved
is

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
um for those folks that have property
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
and current use Recreation if I then
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
choose to put up a sign that restricts
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
the use of my property which violates
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
current use Recreation
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
um do I then lose my 20 tax break that I
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
get for allowing anybody to come on my
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
property and hunt fish uh bird watch
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do so I just think
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things we could do to
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
make this bill better and clarify things
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh it would be worthwhile to work on
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
a little bit more
 
00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:58.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tudor
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be voting
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
against the retaining motion
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
um as said we have two amendments before
 
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
um as said we have two amendments before
us

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
two amendments that we heard in the
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing of issues that needed to
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
I put forward an amendment that I worked
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
with those folks
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
and drafted
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
posting your property for prohibiting
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
use of cameras has anything to do with
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
the current use tax credit
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything in law that
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
prohibits that and I'm sure there's some
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
folks out there that know the law very
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
well that are big landowners that could
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
address that so I don't think that's an
 
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.590 align:start position:0%
address that so I don't think that's an
issue

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
what an issue is is
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
having somebody put a piece of
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
surveillance equipment on your property
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
is an issue
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
and these pieces of equipment now aren't
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
like what they used to be where you had
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
to go in the woods pull a card out
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
and actually take it home to download
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
the images you had
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
these cameras do lifetime video and
 
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
these cameras do lifetime video and
photos

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
photos
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
of your property whether you're a
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
hundred feet from your house or you're a
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
thousand feet from your house walking a
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
trail on your property that you own
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
pictures can be taken real time and
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment before us will address
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
so I ask that you vote against the
 
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.310 align:start position:0%
so I ask that you vote against the
retain

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
respect the landowners rights
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
I know I wouldn't want somebody
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
having a camera on my property on a
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
walking trail if I own 25 acres and I'm
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
out well beyond my house walking the
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
property and they put it on a tree that
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see it watching me every morning
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
walk my property without my permission
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm not voting for The retain I hope
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of you will follow me and let's
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
pass on it past this landowner's Bill of
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
Rights here that gives them the respect
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
of their property as to what's put on it
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the retention
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
the emails that I've been receiving
 
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
the emails that I've been receiving
um

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
indicate that landowners are concerned
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
about cameras being placed on their
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
property without any identification and
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
what they then think they might do to
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
protect their land and themselves is
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
simply post the land so therefore
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be less and less land
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
available for hunters and those of us
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
that do support ethical hunting that's
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
not what we want to see happen so I will
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
be voting against the retention so we
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
can discuss discuss the motions and and
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
also respect the wishes and the rights
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
of landowners thank you
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative uh Brown uh thank you Mr
 
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.870 align:start position:0%
representative uh Brown uh thank you Mr
chairman

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough as I sit through
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
this as a freshman I see so often we
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
have a bill somewhere
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
and someone says well this isn't quite
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
right and the committee goes ahead and
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
sends it on and we hope it's going to be
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
fixed by someone else later this has
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
already come to us so I I am I am for
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's Amendment except for the
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
300 feet based on my constituencies
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about privacy as a
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative Golian representative
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
Harvey said however
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
I am all in favor of the peace about the
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
current use land and as
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said if we aren't
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
clear on that
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's someone out there that
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
knows the answer as you said but if we
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
aren't clear on this current use piece
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
and if there's anything we're not clear
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
in about this
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
let's get it right before we take it to
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
the house floor and before we move it on
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I I am and again I'm following my
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
constituents wishes that they they do
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
want privacy for their property there's
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
no question
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
um but let's get this let's bring it to
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
the floor solidly and make sure we have
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I hate this because the reason that I
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
wanted to support retain is because I
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
think we can make posting easier for
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
people which is something I've worked on
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
before but we just passed on consent
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
needing permission for a tree stand a
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
camera is the amplification of the
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
ability to surveil which is much worse
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
than a tree stand in my mind so I I
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
can't imagine why we wouldn't require
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
permission for that
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so those are my thoughts right now
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
just as chair I'm going to clarify that
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
what we passed on consent for the tree
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
stands did not require permission for
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
any placement only for placing beyond
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have a number of folks in the
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
audience and I wanted to see if we could
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
get their take on current use and if
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
posting with game cameras would affect
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
current use status they are the
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners and they know very
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
well what the laws are and how they are
 
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.850 align:start position:0%
well what the laws are and how they are
enforced

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
is there someone from the Timberland
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
Association that would like to speak to
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
the current use I know that there's a
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
list currently of things that are
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to be posted for such as ohrv
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh my intent with the amendment that I
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
drafted was to add cameras to that list
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
so that it was a definite exemption and
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
nobody could ever lose that 20 percent
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
but if somebody wants to speak to
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
whether that's clear or not already
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
so for for the record I'm Jason stock
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New

Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
in

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm reviewing this language now
 
00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.930 align:start position:0%
I'm reviewing this language now
um

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:58.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
on the Fly here
 
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.890 align:start position:0%
on the Fly here
um

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it and correct me if
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong you would not be eligible for
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
the 20
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
reduction uh in your assessment if you
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
disallow game cameras is that what this
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
no this is saying that
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
even if you post your land that says no
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
game cameras allowed you'd still get
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
your 20 percent
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
because currently uh the current use
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
says that you can that you're not going
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
to lose your 20 if you post against
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
motorized vehicles like ohrvs
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and such but that's the only
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
exemption if if you post against
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
somebody hiking you lose your 20 if you
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
post against hunting you lose your 20 so
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do and what this
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
language does is ADS uh game cameras
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
into the list of things you're allowed
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
to post for and still keep your twenty
 
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.610 align:start position:0%
to post for and still keep your twenty
percent

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah I I guess
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
right now the way the the current use
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
law is structured and Rob this thing
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
just went to sleep on me
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you it's but it and
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
really the focus is pedestrian and
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
pedestrian access
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
ohrvs that's correct you I mean ohrvs
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
are kind of a if it's motorized they
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
have they are obligated to get
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
permission but currently
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
there shall be no prohibition on skiing
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing fishing hunting hiking or
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
nature observation
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's really you know that's the
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
the universe for the recreational
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
recreational discount if you were to say
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
you know and to me game cameras
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
I guess I I find this discussion
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit odd because it's
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
not really a pedestrian I'm placing
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
something on your piece of property it's
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
Act of placing something not skiing or
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing I'm not sure this is even
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
necessary candidly I mean I appreciate
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
the intent if if I post against game
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
cameras and I can remain in current use
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
and eligible for the recreational
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
discount fine I'm I'm fine with that
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
but again to me the way current use is
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
structured is it really focuses on the
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
use and not placement of something on my
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
on my property I.E camera or or tree
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I kind of question the need need
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
for this but I do appreciate the attempt
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
and and you know if I if I post against
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
game cameras and I'm and I continue to
 
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.340 align:start position:0%
remain in the current use 20
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
recreational discount
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'm I'm fine with that I
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean as long as I can continue to get my
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
20 assessment discount for recreation
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
if I post against game cameras
 
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.289 align:start position:0%
if I post against game cameras
um

00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think here it's almost
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
like a double negative
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to lose I'm not going to
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
lose anything if I say no game cameras
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
is I guess is the way I read this now I
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's other
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
interpretations and again kind of
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
reading this and interpreting it on the
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
Fly is a little bit
 
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
Fly is a little bit
tricky

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
tricky
 
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.909 align:start position:0%
tricky
um

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of questioning whether it's
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
even necessary candidly because
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not snowshoeing it's not
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a pedestrian activity
 
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.529 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a pedestrian activity
really

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:47.299 align:start position:0%
that's those are my my thoughts on a
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
five-minute review and and kind of
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about current use assessment
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the recreational
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
not to not to even I don't think it's
 
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
relevant in some respects but
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
nevertheless so try to answer any
 
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.450 align:start position:0%
nevertheless so try to answer any
questions

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I I have one more when when these
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
determinations on whether you have
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
violated current use come down it's the
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
local assessor who who determines that
 
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
and then you have to appeal it if
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've done so correct yeah so it's so
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
every local assessor may have a
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
different opinion on what uh might or
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
might not violate that and so
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
proactively telling them they cannot
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
remove it if you do this at least
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
codifies that and locks it down correct
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
they sure that I I guess in that respect
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
it may be helpful
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
um but again I just I don't
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
I I kind of question it the need for it
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
to begin with thank you for your time
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
today thank you representative Hill you
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
had a question I do uh of the chair
 
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.289 align:start position:0%
had a question I do uh of the chair
um procedurally

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
um procedurally
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why we're talking about
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
two amendments that have not been
 
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
two amendments that have not been
introduced

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me we're the
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
question on the floor is retain of the
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah we did drift a little
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
bit we were I mean the purpose of the
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
retain was to try to combine amendments
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
so there was allowed some discussion of
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
why we might want to combine those
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
amendments or work on a solution that
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
takes from both
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
um that was the intent from the
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative who made the retention
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
motion so uh but I think we probably are
 
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.570 align:start position:0%
done with that
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.930 align:start position:0%
done with that
[Music]

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative nodder
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the original bill in
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
front of me are these amendments
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
significantly different than the
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
it depends on what you consider
 
00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:42.409 align:start position:0%
it depends on what you consider
significant

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
they are different
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
um but the changes are if we get to
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
those amendments being introduced you'll
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up follow-up well because
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
if they're very different they may
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
require a public hearing they're not
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
significantly different enough for a
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
public hearing but well that would be an
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
is there any other comments questions oh
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair so I'll jump in
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
again even even uh uh Mr stock
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh comments
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
yeah it still isn't 100 clear and we
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
heard from a number of
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh people testifying that there was
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
concern about the the current of loss of
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
that piece of their current use I think
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a really important thing and I
 
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
think we should uh I'm gonna still say
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
we should retain this
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do we have any
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair a vice chair sorry thank
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
and I I will just make a comment that
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
if someone chooses not to allow tree
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
stands there's nothing in a lot of
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the posting of no tree
 
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.370 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the posting of no tree
stands

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't see how that would be any
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
different as to being posted put into
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
current news statute
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I think it was pretty clear that
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
the post the current use has to deal
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
with traveling through property and
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
being allowed on property not putting
 
00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:22.909 align:start position:0%
being allowed on property not putting
personal

00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
property of another on someone else's
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%

and discussion
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.050 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
um

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
tries to strike a balance between the
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
privacy of the landowners and the
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
traditional uh hunting
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
by restricting cameras from anywhere
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
within 300 feet of a building or a
 
00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:55.790 align:start position:0%
within 300 feet of a building or a
driveway

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
driveway
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
but allowing the cameras on other parts
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
of property
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
unless the person who owns the property
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
puts a sign up
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
to post No cameras they do not need to
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
post the whole land just one sign at the
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
entrance to the property or any number
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
of entrances at the property
 
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.870 align:start position:0%
of entrances at the property
um

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
it also changes the fine down to a
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars from the Thousand that
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:25.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
and changes the effective date to
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
and it also specifically says that the
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
first violation of of the uh
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
any camera displaced illegally would be
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
a warning to let people know that they
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing that
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
give everybody a first chance to realize
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
that they did something wrong
 
00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:52.970 align:start position:0%
that they did something wrong
and

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
that I believe is the extent of oh and I
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
changed it from written permission to
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
regular permission
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then I've added the whole section on
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
the current use to make sure that it's
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
codified and no local assessor can come
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
and say well in my opinion in my reading
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
of it a camera is used for
 
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.510 align:start position:0%
of it a camera is used for
um

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
Wildlife viewing
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so you posted it against cameras so
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to take away your uh current
 
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.829 align:start position:0%
we're going to take away your uh current
use

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
by codifying it we've basically drawn
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
the line and said that I don't care what
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
you think is a personal assessor for
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
this town we've said as a state level
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that cameras can be prohibited just
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
like ohrvs and you must still let them
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
have their 20 discount
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
I look at it as proactive
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
and making sure that somebody's right to
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
that discount is not infringed by their
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
wish to not have cameras on their
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
property and that's all I have on that
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
oh yeah uh same hunting day that was the
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
other change
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
the remote cameras were the the original
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
Bill had the uh the remote cameras
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
restricted 24 hours that becomes a
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
problem because if you put if you get a
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
picture of a deer right before uh sunset
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
and it's 24 hours that means you can't
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
hunt there the whole next day
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
because you've gotten it
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh 24 hours
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
so same hunting day if you get it before
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
Sunset and the hunting day ends
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
you can still go hunt there tomorrow and
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure the deer is not still
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to be standing there the next day
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
right so I think that that gives plenty
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
the whole night
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
we've gone into a new hunting day and
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
unless the deer is dumb enough to wait
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
around for you he's not going to be
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
standing there in the same spot so that
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
was another important change to to fix
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate version
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that's all I've got uh anybody got
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I think you missed one
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
other to me very significant change
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
between the bill that was presented from
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate and your Amendment uh it's in
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
section 2A of the original Amendment yes
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's still section 2A on your own on
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
your Amendment so line 11 of the
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
amendment says a person may place a game
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
camera that records et cetera et cetera
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
Etc uh in the bill presented from the
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
Senate it says no person shall place a
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
game camera that records transmits etc
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
etc without the written consent of the
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's because we added the
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
section that says where they're
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing it without the
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
permission is 300 feet of any building
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
on the property or any driveway
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
so so you're we're allowing it still if
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
it's deep in the woods or far enough
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
away from a house to be put there
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
without permission
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
but if it's within the 300 feet it must
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
have the permission
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I consider this to be a small step
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
forward to changing it and I think if
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
you know if it turns out that it wasn't
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
enough perfectly willing to come back
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
with another bill uh that further
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
restricts it but I like to take things
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
in small steps when you're taking away
 
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh a traditional way of of surveilling
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
deer and and patterning them and hunting
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think that the smaller steps taken
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
gradually to alleviate the problems
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
better than taking and
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
completely changing the way things go
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
um and I would I would liken it to not
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
amputating an arm when you can just
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up all right I think that if we
 
00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:40.670 align:start position:0%
follow-up all right I think that if we
make

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.810 align:start position:0%
make
um

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
what I consider a significant change
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
by Amendment from that which was
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
presented to the public because the
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
public testimony was all based on the
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
you can't put out a camera unless you
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
get permission and all the responses I
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
have seen have been very much in favor
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
of that then I think we have to go back
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
to public hearing
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
but we are not changing the way the
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
current law is
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
this is just simply this change in the
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
amendment puts it back to the way it is
 
00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
amendment puts it back to the way it is
now

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate's version of wording was
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
turning what the way it works now
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
on its head
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
so this is going back that whole section
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
is just being reverted to the way it
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
you currently do not need permission to
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
go on anyone's property and put a camera
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
on it that's what we're trying to fix
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
because right now you can put it
 
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.010 align:start position:0%
because right now you can put it
anywhere

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to say let's limit it
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
within 300 feet of any building or
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
driveway first
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I specifically added the driveways
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
in because we heard testimony that
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
um people might put a camera up to watch
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes and goes and then
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
burgle the house
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable to me we want to
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
enhance the privacy but I'm trying to
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
strike a balance with this amendment to
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
not completely change all the hunting
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
rules right away let's take a small step
 
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:56.710 align:start position:0%
forward in my opinion
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.290 align:start position:0%
forward in my opinion
[Music]

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.190 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
I've got some hands down here first
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I appreciate
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
the balance as most people know I prefer
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
balance over anything
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess my biggest concern is the 300
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
feet of occupied building or dwelling
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I live in the city so 300 feet is no
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
big deal right but occupy dwelling
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me because I imagine my
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues at work or friends that I
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
have across the state they have a barn
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
or a shed or something that may be more
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
than 300 feet away from their house and
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
then if we say that building doesn't
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
count so you can put a camera near that
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
shed or building because it's not
 
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
shed or building because it's not
occupied

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
occupied
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
that now and someone can surveillance
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
that particular piece of building on
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
this person's property even though it's
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
not occupied so that's my biggest
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
concern and then
 
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.849 align:start position:0%
concern and then
um

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:55.700 align:start position:0%
two I think the
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
gives gives enough time that people will
 
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.270 align:start position:0%
gives gives enough time that people will
know

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
um when if we don't change the bill
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
people will have enough time to know
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
they need to get permission but it's the
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
300 feet from the Occupy dwelling that
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
concerns me because if it's occupied of
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
course you don't want to have a camera
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
facing your house or near your house but
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
if you have other pieces or buildings on
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
your property that you also don't want
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
people to surveillance that is a concern
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
it does that make sense it makes sense
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I asked Colonel Jordan to step
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
forward to the microphone and explain
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
the fishing game uh uh interpretation of
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
occupied versus permanently occupied
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
so well it's not a fishing game it's
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
been done by the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:39.230 align:start position:0%
been done by the New Hampshire Supreme
Court

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and an occupied dwelling is a
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
dwelling that would allow for overnight
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
accommodations so you could have a camp
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
you could have a barn if it has a bed in
 
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.530 align:start position:0%
you could have a barn if it has a bed in
it

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I suppose would fit that description
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not something that we control is
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
something the Supreme Court uh denotes
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
so I do have one other comment that I
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
think is pretty important that people
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
understand here if I can make it on the
 
00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:04.190 align:start position:0%
understand here if I can make it on the
amendment

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
let me get to my other questions on the
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee before I come back to you for
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's a big it is a big issue
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
you can you can feel free to stay in the
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
seat because we might have other
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
you're good yes thank you Jim
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
I would also like to come in the chair
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
on what is for the most part I think a
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
very reasonable compromise
 
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
very reasonable compromise
um

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
I so the 300 feet from an occupied
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
dwelling or driveway I I just imagine if
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
I had land and I had a pond that I liked
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
to Skinny Dip in or a clearing that I
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to sunbathe in
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
um that the occupied swelling wouldn't
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
cover that and again I I think it's
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
important to remember that while we talk
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
about these cameras in the context of
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
hunting it's not just hunting it's
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
anyone can put a camera up your ex could
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
come and put a camera up without
 
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.849 align:start position:0%
come and put a camera up without
permission

00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
um so and you know we can talk about the
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
hunting aspect and what is traditional
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
surveillance because when when the
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
common is made that it traditionally
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
surveilled by camera while traditional
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
hunting would be going out into the
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
woods and creating your own bow and
 
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
arrow and then carving your own
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
Arrowhead so uh you know what is
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
traditional but
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but it's not just hunting we can have
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
Fair Chase conversation but it's not
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
just hunting it's anything and so the
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
the part of this amendment that gives me
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
the most pause
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
is the idea that the first violation is
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
has to be a warning because that takes
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
away the
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
um the ability for the justice system to
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not that was
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
maliciously done or accidentally done uh
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
which is what they have the ability to
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
determine now and and pursue that
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
accordingly as to what makes sense for
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
that situation and this is saying no
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
even if it was my ex that put a camera
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
on my property in such a way as to
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
surveil me that that would still have to
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
be just a warning and that bothers me so
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of trouble with the 300
 
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.530 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of trouble with the 300
feet

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
um right now you can't fire within 300
 
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:25.700 align:start position:0%
feet of a building anyway so
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean too much
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and again in talking to my
 
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.270 align:start position:0%
um and again in talking to my
constituents

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
they want written permission rather the
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
cameras within 300 feet or not within
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
300 feet and again they're
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
remedy is then well then I just will
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
post my land and we'll have less land
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
for hunting I actually
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Reed
 
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.650 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Reed
um

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with the fine uh
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
being levied the first time around we're
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody's privacy here
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
that you can't just say to them oh
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
please don't do that again that wasn't
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
very nice
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
um it it really needs to have some teeth
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
to it so I don't have a problem with
 
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.750 align:start position:0%
to it so I don't have a problem with
that

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
um with the fine being lovey the first
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
time around I even like the thousand
 
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.569 align:start position:0%
time around I even like the thousand
dollars

00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
um but my my biggest thing is um I I
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
want written permission no matter where
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
you put the camera on somebody's private
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Rosner
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to Second a lot of everybody
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
else's spoken concerns about the 300
 
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.190 align:start position:0%
else's spoken concerns about the 300
feet

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I think when it comes to a person's
 
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.670 align:start position:0%
um I think when it comes to a person's
property

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
um people are within their rights if
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
they own this space to say yeah as long
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
as you stay away from this certain
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
allotted space but if it is your
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
property and first and foremost it's
 
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.069 align:start position:0%
property and first and foremost it's
your

00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
um your things to do whatever you want
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
to do in that space
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it makes a lot of sense that
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
whereas anything else that is public
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
people can go and do whatever they want
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
that if it is owned land by a specific
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
person they get to denote what they do
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
and do not want other people other
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
strangers doing on their land and I
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense in the sense of if
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
we approach this as it is just Good
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
Samaritan citizens hunting
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think that it becomes an issue
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
when we look at this from the standpoint
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this is state law and anybody who
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
can go and spend Thirty forty dollars on
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
a camera can do whatever they want
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
outside of 300 feet of an occupied space
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to kind of reiterate
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
everything that everyone else has said
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
um I like the idea that a landowner
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
could denote
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
what they feel is their standard and not
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
have it regulated by the state what that
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
standard has to be for them whether or
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
not they're going to be able to get that
 
00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:06.349 align:start position:0%
not they're going to be able to get that
20

00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:48:06.359 --> 00:48:07.490 align:start position:0%
20
Etc

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
um and I also
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
um think again the um
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
the the warning and the fee I I don't
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
know if I agree with how standardized
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
that is I think that on a case-by-case
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
basis that needs a little bit more
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
wiggle room to
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
um address every situation specifically
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
because again uh innocent accident is
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
very different than what is not a an
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
innocent accident
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on the panel
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'll go with the vice chair first and
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
then we'll follow up with you
 
00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:47.329 align:start position:0%
then we'll follow up with you
representative

00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I too cannot support
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the 300 feet he heard testimony from
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
numerous people out there
 
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
numerous people out there
and

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
these landowners don't own just two or
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
three acres
 
00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:08.099 align:start position:0%
they own 40 50 one 200 Acres pieces of
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
property that big enough to have a small
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
pond on
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
a family Cemetery
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
trails that they hold sacred that maybe
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
a loved one we heard is their ashes may
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
be spread upon
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
that they may not want to be filmed or
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
videoed and have posted online
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
I think they have that right
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't have to post their
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
property to say it's not right to put a
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
camera into video of this
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
they just have the ability to say no
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'll allow you to put a camera on but
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
please don't put it where
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
and you know I think representative Reed
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
made a great point when she talked about
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
you know the swimming or whatever and
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
like I said these big pieces of property
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
many do have ponds
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
where things like this take place
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't prohibit a camera from
 
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't prohibit a camera from
there

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
so I can't support this I think it needs
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
to be a permission and strictly
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
permission if you're going to surveil a
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
property thank you
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
Harvey I I would just like to ask if
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan would please be allowed
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
to make his comment especially since he
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
said it was very important and I always
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
um respect Colonel Jordan's comments
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
and he will I'm just trying to make sure
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
that all of the discussion here gets to
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
take place in case there's more
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
questions for him so we can have him
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
address them all at the same time
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Brown and thank you Mr
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
chair just to remind everyone we had the
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
conversation about the thousand dollar
 
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
fine during the hearings and there was
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
some concern that even though it said up
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
to theoretically someone with 10 cameras
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
could get fined a thousand dollar for
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
each camera and that although it may
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
sound great to have a thousand dollar
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
fine to really stop
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
something that you don't want the
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
potential is to find somebody ten
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if they had ten cameras
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
and that was why I think on both sides
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
so a couple things I really appreciate
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
the discussion and the interest in
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing what was testified to by
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
landowners because I think it's very
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
important and I commend both these
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
amendments for trying to do that
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so two two comments that I would like
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
to make that are that are concerning
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
about this particular one first one is
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
the discretion of officers so that is a
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
hurdle we as managers at least I have as
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
the chief of law enforcement have
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
struggled with because I'll have one
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
individual officer who will issue a
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
warning for a certain offense and
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
another one issues uh Citation for that
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
offense and I've thought of getting a
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
better handle of controlling that maybe
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
writing a policy that required them to
 
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
write tickets instead of warnings and
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
and what I found was exactly what
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative Reed commented to is you
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
can't it's very difficult to do that
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to do that
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
because the intent of the offense
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
changes with every individual person so
 
00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:21.619 align:start position:0%
someone may in fact just make a mistake
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
and in that case that is appropriate for
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
a warning where other people may be
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
intentionally filming someone who and
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
they've been warned not to do that and
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
that would tie my hands to not be able
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
to address that and I can't imagine
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
facing facing an ex-wife for instance
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
who was videotaped by her ex-husband
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
during a divorce and me telling her that
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
I can't do anything except give him a
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
warning so I I certainly appreciate what
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative spleen is trying to
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish I will tell you this sir that
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
our staff I'm very confident when I tell
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
you that at least my staff I can speak
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
for is very good at that I think and I
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
have found if I sit quietly and keep my
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
mouth shut that they do an outstanding
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
job with Discerning that and I worry
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
about trying to regulate that more
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
importantly the one paragraph here that
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
really disturbs me is paragraph starts
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
on 2A per line 11. we've put in the bill
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
now we've so it will be in law that says
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
a person may place a camera that records
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
or transmits image images or data of any
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
kind while unattended outside on the
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
private property of another without
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
written consent of the property owner
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
the problem that that's going to create
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
is I now do not have the authority when
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
the landowner calls me and says I don't
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
want that on my property you need to go
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
remove it I can't do that because the
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
law allows for it that's concerning
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
because now you've taken away all rights
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
of our property owners and I don't think
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
that was representative spleen's intent
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't think that was but if
 
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
you put that in this law that's exactly
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is I will be we
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
will be powerless to remove it I don't
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
think we ever want to do that so those
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
are the two things that and I thank you
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
for your indulging me thank you colonel
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
I will just uh make a comment that
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
I wish we had been able to retain this
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
so that we could uh continue working on
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
it I think that if we could come back to
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
that motion at some point today I think
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's probably a better way to go because
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
I I really also want to point out that
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
that requiring somebody to get
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
when they the the land is not posted
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
could be abused by people who just don't
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
want people of a certain type on their
 
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.510 align:start position:0%
want people of a certain type on their
property

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to point out that you know
 
00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:47.329 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to point out that you know
it

00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
if I go and ask a landowner for
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
permission and I'm granted permission
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the camera and somebody who looks
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
different than me or sounds different
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
than me or doesn't have uh drive a truck
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
as nice as mine goes up and tries to ask
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
for this permission and is denied I
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
think we're opening ourselves for a
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of a problem here with uh
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
people not getting the same
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities as others
 
00:55:10.569 --> 00:55:10.579 align:start position:0%
um and I'd hate to see that happen but
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
I stand on it and um
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
I guess if there's no other comments
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
from anybody we'll go ahead and ask the
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%

make it note that I was for us to caucus
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
because I was taken aback by the
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
potential of uh discrimination based on
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
the on the property owners bias
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
um but after uh talking with my
 
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
colleagues understanding that we have
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
federal and state regulations that help
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
folks when it comes to discrimination or
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
if they felt they were discriminated
 
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
if they felt they were discriminated
against

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%

01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh who made the original second in
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
motion on the OTP Mr clerk I didn't
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
I believe I need the second on the OTP
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I didn't record that I
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
have cold
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you did it okay thank you so
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
co-fault was second and and uh the vice
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
chair was was the motion
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
I will withdraw my second
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay and would you be willing to
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion of OTP so that uh
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
Rosner could reconsider
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm going to stick with my
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
motion of art to pass
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I try to work a compromise here and I
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
don't see that going forward the Senate
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
sent us a bill that
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
landowners have asked for
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
it deals with the surveillance of
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
property I think we had unfortunately
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
two amendments in front of us
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
to address and specifically one to
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
address the uh surveillance of property
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
and property rights this will go ahead I
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't think landowners want to wait any
 
01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.290 align:start position:0%
don't think landowners want to wait any
longer

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
um on putting a stop to surveilling
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
property without written permission or
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
without permission
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
so I will
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
keep my motion and hopefully get a
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
second from someone to take a vote on
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey I'll second it
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
we have another second but it's been
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
thrown on the floor for it
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative nodder first if the
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
octopass fails can it then go back to
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will state I
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
once again I don't think this bill needs
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
to be retained I think it's been vetted
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
stuff in front of us and the longer we
 
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
stuff in front of us and the longer we
wait

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
the more surveillance is going on
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
without permission
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's on your local pond this
 
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
whether it's on your local pond this
summer

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
or the back 40 that you may own
 
01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.330 align:start position:0%
or the back 40 that you may own
and

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to go forward with this now
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Rosner
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that I'm I'm
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
completely happy with doing the OTP
 
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and then if that fails we do the
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
retain I did originally vote to retain
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and I will vote OTP on the SB but I
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
felt as though we as a body here are
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
really not on the same page so
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
um our vote on OTP I'm happy to do uh
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
and happy to see that that comes first I
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify my my reason for
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
bringing up retain and um
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily knowing how that process
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
works thank you
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tudor
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I just think to ought to pass this
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
at this point um I mean I wasn't at the
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
public hearing but I did watch the tapes
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
and there were numerous issues brought
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
up about this bill about the Senate bill
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why we wrote the
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
two amendments and just just a punt and
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
go back to the Senate bill I think is
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing to do I think we should
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
be you know kill the auth to pass and
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
then go back and reconsider the retain
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
so we can actually work on this thing
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
and make it better because it's not
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
going to matter about your Pawn this
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
summer this bill isn't going into effect
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
until January no matter what we do so we
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
have time to work on it and still get it
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
out there for the next hunting season
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
because that's really what this bill is
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
I think we've all been on the receiving
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
end of the emails there have been
 
01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:54.260 align:start position:0%
multiple emails from many landowners
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
constituents they would like to see us
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
act on game cameras and
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
needing permission to put game cameras
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
on property
 
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.070 align:start position:0%
on property
um

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
were all in agreement
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate has sent us a bill that will
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
I think at this point it would
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
be neglectful not to
 
01:21:25.689 --> 01:21:25.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
Vice chair
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just got to respond
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
in putting this off
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
it won't be ready for January 1st 2024
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at now we're in May during
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024. we retain this we
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
won't be back here until November
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
December voting on these so it won't be
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
in place anytime close to that by the
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
time rules are put in place
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
so yes time is of the essence thank you
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Fox
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just one quick
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
note that the Senate bill is written uh
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
it takes effect 60 days after it's
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
passed so that one would be quicker than
 
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.169 align:start position:0%
passed so that one would be quicker than
what's

01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
what's
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
being proposed with January 1st the next
 
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.790 align:start position:0%
being proposed with January 1st the next
year

01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I I have two
 
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I think that issue of the passage in
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
60 days was discussed in the public
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
hearing that that was probably not a
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll say it again I guess maybe this
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
is the Boy Scout piece coming out
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
why are we
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
approving something that we're all
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
seeming to say isn't ready yet I just
 
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.020 align:start position:0%
don't get it
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
there's let's put a committee together
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
and and work together I don't know what
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative goalie how he worked with
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
it and he told me he worked with the
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
groups I don't know exactly what that
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
conversation was we I I just can't s I
 
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
just can't send something along that we
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
have so many questions about
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh the motion is on the OTP no Amendment
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
think we've had too many votes here
 
01:23:39.239 --> 01:23:42.169 align:start position:0%
think we've had too many votes here
right

01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
do we need another sheet I know I got
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
them I just
 
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
them I just

yeah there's a thing at Al Brook and I'm
in

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay let me know okay all right so
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
so we're working with Des to get a a
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
boat trip on the river not Out on the
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
Ocean but up on the piscatica river to
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
look at the proposed uh boat ramp and
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
launch the fishing games wants uh the
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
D.O.T wants to put in on Hilton Park and
 
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to see a uh an oyster
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
farming operation and how they do that
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is really interesting if you've
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
never seen it uh Des has got a 35-foot
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
boat and Fish and Game might bring one
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
of their boats um
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
still working on the date there it had
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
to go it had to go up the chain to the
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
important people and they haven't talked
 
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
so when we get a date we'll we'll work
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
on that but uh I wanted to let people
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to hear the bill on
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
the boat ramp that went over to uh
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
Public Works
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
um so even though it's it's a boat ramp
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
for fish and game activities it's going
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
to public works because they deal with
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
boat ramps but we can still see where
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
they're planning to put it
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again everyone have a
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
great rest of the day and we'll see you
