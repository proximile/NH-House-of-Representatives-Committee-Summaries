00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody Welcome to
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
Transportation as we start the second
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
half uh before we do get started if we
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
could all rise for the pledge
 
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:49.790 align:start position:0%
could all rise for the pledge
please

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that and now for
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
those of you that haven't been in a
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
single room before this is what we all
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
used to do in back in the day so we were
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
one of the lucky ones to go back back to
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
a half room um for now I guess we'll
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
start our first public hearing I will
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on heal
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
031 relative to motor vehicle
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of title exemptions
 
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative you still introducing
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
yep yeah the prime sponsor did email me
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
said he couldn't make it he was double
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
it all right good morning chairman and
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
members of the transportation committee
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Santa naso
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of ring daffre
 
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.110 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of ring daffre
and

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
Dublin um so I'm here today to introduce
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1032 this bill proposes a
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
change in the current title exemption
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
period shifting from the static cut off
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh for vehicles older than the year 2000
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
to a dynamic one that encompasses
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh 10 years or older um so cars
 
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
today extremely reliable last decades
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
and people often lose the titles for
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
their vehicles for various reasons um
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
some are unaware of the procedures to
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
obtain a duplicate title While others
 
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
are detered by the complexity and
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
potential costs involved
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
um the the market is Rife with vehicles
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
listed as no title which significantly
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
diminishes their value and marketability
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are often sold for
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
fractions of their potential value
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
except for those of model year 1999 or
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
older uh which benefit from the title
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
exemption uh this discrepancy creates an
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
unfair Market situation where
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
individuals are hesitant to engage with
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
the system and secure titles for their
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
newly purchased vehicles uh they
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the difficulty and often often
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
opt to invest in a more comparable
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle that either possesses a title or
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
is older than the year
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
2000 um and considering the necessity of
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
titles for older vehicles particularly
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
in cases of fraud or theft it's
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge that the
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
state's existing mechanism for tracking
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle ownership for vehicles that are
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
20 years older uh the state already
 
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
possesses a historical record of
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
ownership through previous registrations
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
uh these records include Cru crucial
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
information about the vehicle's pass
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
owners their addresses and other
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
pertinent details um so in instance of
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
suspected fraud or theft authorities can
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
read access these records to assern the
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
vehicle's ownership history and
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
investigating any
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
discrepancies uh this system of
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
retaining and accessing past
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
registration data provides a robust
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
safety net diminishing the need for
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
titles as a protective measure against
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
fraud or theft for these older lower
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
value Vehicles consequently the
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
exemption from requiring a title as
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposed in House Bill 1031 is a
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
sensible adjustment that acknowledges
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
the state's current capabilities
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
capabilities to track and verify vehicle
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
ownership through means other than the
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
title system uh the most useful function
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the title is I I believe is to
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
collateralize debt for an auto loan uh
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
so 10 years is more than enough time for
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
a lean holder to get paid for the car uh
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
typically an autol loan a long autol
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
loan is six years um and a 10-year-old
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
car basically is useless collateral uh
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
so and if someone does sell a car that
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
has a lean on it uh and con seals that
 
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
fact to the buyer uh the sellers
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
committing fraud and it just be easy for
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
the bank to show that since they still
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
hold the uh title um and in the case of
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
these older cars the stakes are pretty
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
low just compared to something like a
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
2-year-old car uh where requiring a
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
title for registration provides
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
value uh by extending the exemption to
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
titles to a rolling year uh we increase
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
the wealth of New Hampshire by allowing
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
cars that would otherwise be worthless
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
to be registered uh we also make cars
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
cheaper to the public by increasing the
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
supply of cars and give New Hampshire
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
citizens the ability to purchase cars
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
with missing paperwork uh like
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
have no title exemption at all and just
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
register them here just like people do
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
today for cars uh older than
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
2000 all right
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh so cars that are pre 99 without
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
titles are easier to register and
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
transfer Than Cars newer than 99 that
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
have missing paperwork um and so I think
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's something happening here where
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
some newer cars like uh the 2000s
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
started coming out with uh better safety
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
features like airbag you know more
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
advanced airbags uh and traction control
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
better ABS but I think a knowledgeable
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
buyer uh making the choice between a
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
1999 Minivan and a comparable 2004
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
minivan would actually purchase the
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
older one even though it has less safer
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
features in this bigger polluter because
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
without the paperwork for the 2024 it's
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
worthless to them they can't register it
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
um and just just a comparison just how
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
titles I just don't think are really
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
that necessary uh if you buy a $5
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
million jet today you send two pieces of
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork to the FAA a bill of sale and
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
an aircraft registration application uh
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
the fa doesn't do anything with titles
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the aircraft registration
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
application as soon as you mail it the
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
copy of it is a registration so you know
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is a five minute process
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
and it's easier than registering a 2002
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
you know Kawasaki motorcycle that just
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have paperwork with it so I
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
actually have a personal story with this
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
issue I had a 2001 PT Cruiser the engine
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
blew in it and I met someone who was
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
doing a rebuild on the same exact car
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
and he wanted the parts so I sold him
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
the car um neither one of us even
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
thought about the title you know
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
whatever just he he towed the car and it
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
was in his driveway and he ripped it
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
apart and did his thing but then a few
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
months later he wanted to junk it and he
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have a title and so he called me
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't find it uh so the pro the
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
car was last registered in Montana so
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
the process took month mons and the guy
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
was in a literal Panic he was calling my
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
work and everything uh because as far as
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
he could tell he was going to have this
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
car in his driveway forever if he
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't get me to cooperate and get him
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
a CO duplicate title um and I think a
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
lot of people have a story like this so
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh people I talk to that you know some
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
people they just get a new car every few
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
years you know they they never even see
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
the title they they sell it back to the
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
dealer and then you know the the
 
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
collateral company always has the title
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
so they don't know about this but a lot
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
of people that deal with older cars they
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
really want a rolling date uh you know
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
if if you talk to any about this
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
eventually someone's going to bring up
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they're gonna say what you
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
got to do is have a friend in Vermont
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
sell him the car he can register in
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont then he sells it back to you and
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
now he was able to secure a title in
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
Vermont so now you can register in New
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I don't actually have
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
any friends in Vermont but I don't think
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
we should be involving another state you
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
know just to register older cars
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
um so our proposal to transition to a
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
rolling exemption date is a
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
transformative measure that will
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
instantly enhance the value of numerous
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
titless cars making them more marketable
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
it will prevent these vehicles from
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
becoming abandoned relics rusting away
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
in backyards across New Hampshire uh it
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
will add supply to the market to lower
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
the price of used cars for lowincome
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
people at a time where costs are
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
increasing uh and there's no reason to
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
have all this Capital rendered useless
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
because of uh Missing titles all right
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
so um ready to take any questions from
 
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.069 align:start position:0%
so um ready to take any questions from
the

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
committee thank thank you sir
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jones did you have a
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
question yeah um I just want to ask for
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
clarity are we speaking to 10:31 or
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
10:32 uh he did say 10:32 he's referring
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
to the 10 years he may is he made a
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
mistake in the introduction of it but we
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
are on 10:31 and that deals with 10
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
years not 20 1032 talks about also did
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
say 20 years so I was confused with that
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh apologies uh so I you are speaking at
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
10:31 I am speaking at 10:31 I prepare
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
to speak for 10:32 uh me and Tom man we
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
both filed these bills completely
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
independent of each other uh and we
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
found out that we had the same bill uh
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
except for the amount of years after it
 
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
was already um filed so uh essentially
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
10:31 10:32 it's exactly the same thing
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
except uh 10:32 is a rolling date going
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
20 years back for title exemption
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
periods and 10:31 which we're discussing
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
years and the beauty of it is where do
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
you see how short a speech is on
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
10:32 uh any other questions from the
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next up chair
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh representative Reed in
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair and committee
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Ellen
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
Reed and I represent Rockingham 10 uh I
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
am a co-sponsor on both of these bills
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the same reason that they both got
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
put in independently um I cannot speak
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
to the automobile um impact of either of
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
these bills I'm here only to speak to my
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
expertise in the motorcycle Community um
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
I have been a a
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycle uh Enthusiast since 2007 I've
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
ridden in I don't know like something
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
like a dozen states probably put in like
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
100,000 miles I'm actually planning a
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
trip to Tennessee and going down to
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
Mexico this summer so um from the
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
motorcycle Enthusiast perspective when
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
the original statute which had the
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
rolling period of 20 years was changed
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
to a static um 2000 and uh and newer or
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
2000 and older um it really impacted uh
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
our ability to buy and sell motorcycles
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is because motorcycles
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
are kind of a weird in between C
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
category of vehicle on the one hand they
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
are Transportation Vehicles like an
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
automobile we use them to commute to
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
work go to the store and what have you
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
on the other hand they are seasonal and
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
are also recreational people think they
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
they want to get into motorcycling they
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
buy something and then all of a sudden
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
you know they have like a near miss or a
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
spill and they're like maybe this isn't
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
for me so there's a lot more turnover
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more storing of the
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle where it may not be in good
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
repair for a number of years and then
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
someone wants to buy it titles aren't
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily being kept and maintained
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
the way they are with automobiles
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
because automobiles are a constant
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
presence people with motorcycles almost
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
always also have an automobile
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
especially up here in the the winter um
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
climbs so because of that changing it to
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
when it changed to a static period a lot
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
of motorcycles suddenly that were in
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
perfectly good repair um became
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
unsellable and really unbi for all
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes because um what is
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
the point of spending even close to fair
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
market value on that vehicle in perfect
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
repair if you can't register it so
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
unlike the car Community if you go out
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
and buy a used car right now you almost
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
never run into a car that well I don't
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
have the title on it you know um you run
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
into that very frequently in New
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as the previous speaker
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
said it is a common practice for
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists to have to they they see a
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
deal they want it if they happen to know
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in Vermont who will work with
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
them they will buy the vehicle the the
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and then somehow go through
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
the process of getting the title in
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
Vermont and then register it back here
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
so rather than have that happen and I
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
and I I'm sure that the prime sponsors
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
would not be favorable to me saying this
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
at a very bare minimum for my purposes I
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
would like to see at least a rolling
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
period and I'm agnostic as to whether
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's 10 or 20 years but the previous
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
statute said 20 years but at least have
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
an exemption so that there is a rolling
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
period for motorcycles in particular and
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to open to
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.310 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I have a funny
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
feeling that the department of safety is
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
going to get hammered but thank you
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you again and I may not be able to
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
come in but what ever I just said for
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
you uh next I'll recognize U Carl
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
hudston from The an Department of Safety
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
who is not taking position on the bill
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
down good morning Mr chairman and thank
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak I'm here to
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
give some just some background
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
title identifies both the vehicle and
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
the owner and unfortunately with today's
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
um market and with um the amount of
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
fraudulent documents that are floating
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
around not only here in New Hampshire
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
but Nationwide um we do run into a
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
number of fraudulent titles and um it is
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
um troublesome and it is time consuming
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
in some instances for somebody
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
to sell the vehicle or register it um
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
because of those issues now having said
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
that uh title is printed on a secure
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
piece of paper it's
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
numbered um there are a lot of security
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh features with it that again identify
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
both the vehicle and the owner and a
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is not titled is not
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
readily accessible or the information
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
about the owner is not readily access
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
ible on a nationwide basis yes um we can
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
always run a registration unfortunately
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
the registrant may not be the owner of
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
the vehicle we run into that with
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles um so they're not
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
tracked nationally and a bill of sale is
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
secure document uh a lot of people make
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
it on their home computer or handw write
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
one out so it's really not a
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that as you
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
well know there are vehicles that get
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
total that then get bought back by
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
either the owner or somebody else um
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
they have to go through a salvage title
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
process which um allows somebody to
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
rebuild a vehicle and then to retitle it
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
um that certainly would not be possible
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
if this was to go
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
through and again we're we're looking at
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
the fraud side of this more than the
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
convenience side for anybody else that
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's our main
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
concern thank you I would take any
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much any
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you sir
 
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you sir
thank

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%

you
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um J recognizes Jennifer Oy from the
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles also not
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman thank you for the
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity along with the members of
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jennifer o and
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau administrator for the
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of title and antie with the
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles here in
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
conard we're not taking a position on
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
this but I did want to along with um
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
trer huddon wanted to provide some
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
information for you today um if these
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
changes were to go through there would
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
be systematic changes required which
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
would come with a uh price tag of close
 
00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:59.310 align:start position:0%
would come with a uh price tag of close
to

00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
$24,000 that's just estimated in
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
addition to that we are looking at a
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
loss in Revenue so for vehicles that are
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
requiring a a title uh of 10 years or
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
newer based on 20123 statistics we
 
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.269 align:start position:0%
newer based on 20123 statistics we
processed

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
processed
 
00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:21.950 align:start position:0%
processed
113,114

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
or older um under our current RSA
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
requiring a 2000 rer to be titled and
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
that was an estimated 200 or sorry
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
$2,829 th000 in Revenue that the state
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
took in the impacts that that comes with
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
um aren't just a DMV that would also be
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
our Highway funds and there's a trickle
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
down effect that comes along with that
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
that then rolls down to the locals so
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
again not coming from a convenience
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint for the customer
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
understanding some of the challenges
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
that they're facing out there currently
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
but this is coming from the
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
informational basis from the Vision
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles I'm open to any
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and I don't know how
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
long you've been working with the
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
Department maybe you can refresh my
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
memory aside from the fraud issue which
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
I know the department of safety is
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
concerned with do you remember and I'll
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
throw the question out in case you don't
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
the justification from going from static
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
to I mean from Rolling to static what
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
did we do this six seven maybe eight
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
years ago it was 2015 it took effect the
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
new rule to go from uh to from 20 years
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
old to 2000 or newer it's 2015 I don't
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
know the legislative standpoints behind
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
it I wasn't involved in that at that
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
point I only worked for the registration
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
portion of
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
things thank you very much any other
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.549 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair could you
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
tell me since you you're talking about
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
loss revenue and stuff all right what
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
happens if we change this to 15 years
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
and split the difference do you have
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers I don't have those numbers
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
I have them based on the um the 10 and
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the 20 could you get those numbers far
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
us I could
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
Clair all can you tell me uh because
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
I've never had to do this if if I lose
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
my title and I want you to replace it
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of that sure that's a
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
very easy question it's a duplicate
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
title application it's a simple single
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
form that you can do either through the
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
mail drop off or um in person and of our
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
DMV locations and it's $25 and all you
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
have to present is your driver's license
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
um if you're in person or just complete
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
the form and sign it if it's going to be
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
through the mail it's a very simple
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
process followup follow up so that loss
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is the loss of the
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
$25 fee $25 fee per title required for
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are issued new when I
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
pulled these statistics these did not
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
include duplicate title applications or
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
any corrections or reprints that we do
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is just based on new applications
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
received if you were to purchase a
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle um of that age and title it as a
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
name I just I just want to say something
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
if I can I I
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
I all right my question is I get I guess
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
I I guess it would be easier for you
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
guys just to increase the fees somewhere
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
to make up for that loss Revenue then to
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
make everybody go through this dance to
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
get titles replaced and do all this
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
other stuff people are talking about
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
with other states so I guess that would
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
be easier for you to do that can you
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
follow would that be easier thank
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's a borderline question for but it
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
was a nice drive representative thank
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much noted thank you uh I
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
do have one while I'm thinking about it
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
is there is a 2000 or is there a
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
year um of a motor vehicle that you
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
cannot where the state will not issue a
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
title for whether corre yes that falls
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
under our exempt title law um and I
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
printed that out just in case you guys
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
needed to reference that so it is um RSA
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
2613 and we actually have a list of
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
vehicles that we will not produce a
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
title for that we will actually deny the
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
title application transaction for so
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
it's trailers that are 3,000 or less uh
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of year and then it is uh
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles are 1999 or older that um
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
are not being registered or titled as an
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
antique because the kind of falls into
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
its own category and then there's a
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
plethora of other ones we have special
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
mobile equipment such as cranes diggers
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh Implements of husbandry things like
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
that thank you you're welcome I won't I
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't I have a statement but I'm not
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to say it we'll talk about it
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
later representative
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
Coker thank you Mr chairman so the
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
question I uh kind of on the revenue
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
source is there a way to would there be
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
a vehicle off the top of your head that
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
we could like transfer that Revenue that
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
we lose from doing that too like I mean
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
there would have to be some kind of
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
process they would have to go to go
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
through right for vehicles that aren't
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
within this category does that make
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
sense no if you maybe try that yeah so
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
what if if a vehicle is you know if
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah let me that's okay yeah let me
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
back a little bit all right not a
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem did you have one yeah
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
problem did you have one yeah
representative

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
C thank you um the question I have is
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
there any
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
particular category of vehicle or type
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
of vehicle such as um types of emission
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
controls or something that caused the
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
borderline to be set at 2000 can you
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
think of anything like that so I'm not
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
aware of what the legislative intent was
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
when Vehicles were changed from a a
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
rolling time period to 2000 again I
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know I wasn't involved in
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.669 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know I wasn't involved in
that

00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
point any other
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr thank you chair
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I just want very possible that 10year
 
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.070 align:start position:0%
um I just want very possible that 10year
old

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle the title could still be held by
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
the bank because non payments or any
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
other reason may or something like that
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
so would this open the door to Broad of
 
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
so would this open the door to Broad of
people

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
respons that's a very good question so
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
as um Sergeant Huddleston spoke to
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
earlier vehicles that require titles uh
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
are more secure we're able to track
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
ownership nationally so if we were to go
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
to this law and I had a vehicle that was
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
11 years old still had a loan on it
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
which is possible we see this all the
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
time if I didn't satisfy that loan I
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
could technically turn around and sell
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
that to you on just a bill of sale
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
without satisfying that loan and now the
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
bank is out I'm in violation of my
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
contract and you purchased a vehicle
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
that you didn't know was an invalid
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
transaction and then you could turn
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
around and sell it so on and so forth um
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that's still considered collateral
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair what other
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
states or do you know any other states
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
that require or have their cut off for
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
titles or in that aspect of things do
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
they do 10 15 20 years always require
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
title being that's a fantastic question
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
it varies throughout the jurisdictions I
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that information off the top
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
of my head that is something that we
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
could potentially pull from the other
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions there are surrounding
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
states that require titles no matter
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
what and there are surrounding states
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
that have a certain cut off whether it
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
be the 10 the 15 the
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
20 that is mixed throughout each
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction any other
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%

the the issues that municipalities have
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
with eagle Eagle junkyards and it's it's
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
a massive issue um and with not being
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
able to remove a vehic vehicle off of
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
property um without going all the way
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
back to to
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
99 there's the the multitude of issues
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
are either the homeowner is either
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
unwilling or unable to process a
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
duplicate title uh toe toe companies and
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
Salvage jards will not remove vehicles
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh off the property with without a
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
without a title title I've worked with
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety uh for about
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
eight 18 months uh before I threw my
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
hands up uh that I couldn't I couldn't
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
find a solution
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I understand the the wrecking yards
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh position they don't want to uh to
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
lose their licenses I understand the
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
state's position for fraud uh and that
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
type of thing but from a municipal
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
standpoint if we had the ability to
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
remove a vehicle off of property with
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
owner's consent uh because they are
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
either unwilling or unable to process
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
that duplicate title uh that would help
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%

technological evolution in the title
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
the DMV to look at electronic leans and
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
electronic titling like they do in a
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
number of other states and it's a move
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
that uh industry wholeheartedly supports
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
um the current title system works and it
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
works well uh under director morasco and
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
um and supervisor oi um the title bureau
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
is uh is firing on all cylinders they've
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
got turnaround times that we've never
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
seen before it's of tremendous benefit
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
to Consumers and to businesses uh to
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
dealers um both franchise independent
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
large and small um but importantly
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
titling Vehicles is is consumer
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
protection but it also really protect or
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
helps um businesses like the auto
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
dealers um it prevents against fraud um
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
stolen vehicles things like odometer
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
tampering uh are all wrapped up in the
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the titling process um and then you
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
heard Trooper hudleston mention rebuilt
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
and salvage vehicles when titles are
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
branded and something comes into a
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
dealership lot we now know whether it's
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
been salvaged whether it's been rebuilt
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's been a flooded vehicle that
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
came up from New Orleans uh we clued
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
into it through the title system so a
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit that way and then in
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of States um resale values are
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
affected because certain auto auctions
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
where a consumer or a dealer would take
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
their vehicle back to the used Market
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed if they aren't
 
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed if they aren't
titled

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
titled
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
so then you're stuck with it so um it
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts the resale value of
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
that vehicle so the current titling
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
system um is in place it's working
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
working well uh we support it and see no
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
need for uh the proposed changes that
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
are wrapped up in um in any of those
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
three bills that you have you have
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
before you today so um with that that's
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
my brief testimony um and I'll see if I
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
can take any questions if there are
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
any yeah I'm going to ask the same
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
question if you can you were around back
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
then I know you were um do you remember
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
what the motivation was for us to go to
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
a fixed date of 20 of
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
2000 versus the rolling date that we had
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
before and the reason I ask is because
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
at some point even in
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
h say it's 2050 and we still have 2020
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
is the static data at what point it does
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
it not affect uh the NH and the dealers
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
year age of a
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle when you start buying a new car
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
every four
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
years uh I don't know the history on it
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we could do um just like the
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
committee researcher we could probably
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
look back for some of the the
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislative history um but I wasn't
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table when that was done
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
back in 2015 um but I'm sure that we
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
could do some research on it and we
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
gladly will if the chairman would like
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
he was my next my next guy to go to I
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
figured your memory is usually pretty
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
sharp I figured I'd ask any other
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
question I can work together as well
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you sir uh that's all I've
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
got I'm going to close the public
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
1031 and just give me one second to
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:37.710 align:start position:0%
 
10:32

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
years

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
do you ever
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
substitute do you ever substitute other
 
00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:37.870 align:start position:0%
substitute do you ever substitute other
committee

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no I've never
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
had okay I'm GNA open up the public
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
1032 uh again if you look this bill
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
except for 10 years and 20 years is
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
actually identical so I mean the the
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
difference between the two numbers is
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
something we can consider as a committee
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm asking that not everybody
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
repeats everything they said on 1031 we
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
we we've got it uh but to make it
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
official chair recognizes representative
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
bill warning
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you chairman and members
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the transportation committee so as I
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
said for uh House Bill 1031 house bill
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
32 is essentially the same thing but has
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
a 20-year uh exemption instead rolling
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
exemption time instead of the 10year um
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
but I can address some of the things uh
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
that came up in 1031 that are relevant
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
to this one as well um the loss and
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
revenue for the titles um I sort of
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
disagree that there'd be a loss in
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue because these are cars that
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
can't be registered so by allowing them
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
to be registered uh that Revenue would
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
be there that that's not there there's
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
no data on these cars because they're
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
not being registered because there's no
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
title but I think what we could do is
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
amend the bill and have a fee for
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
registering a car with a missing title
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
have a a missing title fee so you go
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
register the car where's the title I
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't have one but I have a bill of sale
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay there's an additional fee uh for
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
this type of uh registration I think
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
that could handle that that loss of
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue I think that's a reasonable idea
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh the $24,000 expenditure to
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
make this change that's only uh
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
24204 Toyota Corollas so I think the
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
cost is is definitely worth um you know
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
what what the benefit the state's going
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
to get out of this I think it's a major
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and I think you know it was
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is a convenience
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about convenience and and
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
fraud but this is a a major convenience
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
I mean the these cars as the uh as a
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
gentleman representing the uh municip IP
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
alties was saying uh they're there you
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
can't do anything with them I mean if
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
the titled and the even though the
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
duplicate title process is simple this
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
is people we're dealing with you know
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
they're like won't do it it's like just
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
please sign this piece of paper if you
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
ever dealt with people it's difficult um
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
when there's problems like junk cars and
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
stuff like this uh and the junkyard
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take these cars but
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
they can't because they need a title um
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
and I think the uh the tenure might have
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
been a little bit too aggressive the 20
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
year because uh the the banks are using
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
titles as as a way to collect their
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
collateral um and I think that's a good
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
system um but 20 years I mean these are
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
junkers so you know if the bank's still
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
holding title you know whe they do they
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
even have any collateral you know what
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
what's that thing worth you know I mean
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's like a 2004 car um and the one
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
thing I didn't consider was the salvage
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
title uh the state trooper brought up
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
that there could be a loophole around
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
that um but
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh so that's something to to consider I
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
could work with a committee if we could
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
come with a solution uh for that because
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we we do want to you know we don't
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
want someone to find out you can just go
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
register a car that has a salvage title
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because they don't they
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a title system um but oh uh
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
nobody tampers with Odoms anymore so
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
that's just no one does that I mean come
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
on uh but the the title system it it's a
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
good thing to have but you know at a
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
certain point when you have junkers and
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
stuff like this I think there should be
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
a rolling date so we can actually get to
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
a point where these cars can be
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
transferred um you know when it comes to
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know not being able to get these
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
duplicate titles you get elderly people
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
disabled people that moved away you know
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
just people just being not helpful uh my
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
personal example was a junkyard story
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
where a guy couldn't get this car off
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
his property uh because he needed the
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
title so it's it's a real problem um so
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
but I'll uh take any
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir thank you would
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
you believe up until recently every
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle in my yard was more than 20
 
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
vehicle in my yard was more than 20
years

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
old uh yeah any questions from the
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee any serious ones seeing n
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Carl hon the Hampshire
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety not taking position
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
on the bill says five minutes but you
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
can do much less if you
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
care thank you Mr chairman thank you m
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I I will do
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
better than five so one of the things
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to to bring up that was
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
just talked about is OD OD odometer
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
tampering we do um have a number of open
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
cases um when we do every year uh of
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
odometer odometer tampering and um it's
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
done by replacing the computer that's in
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
the car the engine control module um
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
people buy it from a junkyard and put it
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
in the car and without having
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
that instrument to clearly Define what
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
when the vehicle is sold how many miles
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
are on it um is again a great big
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
Consumer Fraud issue
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
um so and everything else that I said
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
before thank you thank you for that any
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
thanks again thank
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
10:32 yeah we'll leave things the way
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
they are for one more speaker Jennifer o
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Motor Vehicles no
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
bill good morning uh same as before uh
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
in addition to that I did pull some
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
statistics on titles that were processed
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
in 2023 that would meet the requirements
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
of this uh Bill and that was
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 20,000 titles just over
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
20,000 titles that we processed um for
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
first time uh with new uh new owners and
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a revenue of
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
$516,000 so there is still a significant
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
impact even though the title fees are
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
significantly low if you look at what
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are taking in um that
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
is still a large impact same system
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
changes would be needed uh additional
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
updates and training throughout the
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
division thank you any other
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative foot thank you
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so the title is that the
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
only way to track down like the
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
Louisiana cars and flooding and so is
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
that the only resource we would have to
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
follow that history of that vehicle that
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
is correct so current currently all
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
titled Vehicles regardless of
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction are run through a National
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
Database in which New Hampshire
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
interfaces with this National Database
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
tracks um NCC which is stolen or theft
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
Vehicles it reports on major crashes um
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
and salvaging of vehicles when a
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle's rebuilt and branded as a
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
rebuilt along with flood and fire damage
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
so those are all tracked in there and
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
that is part of the permanent record
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
within that National Database so if we
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
have a question if we have a vehicle
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
that comes through that does not have
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
one of those brands on it this National
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
Database when it interfaces with our
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
system of record will notify us our
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
examiners and we will then notify the
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
customer what the next steps they have
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
to take to uh to come into compliance
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
and have the proper title issued if it
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
was a non-titled vehicle which you know
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at a 1999 that had had a
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
salvage Brin on it you know number of
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
years ago then that goes completely
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
undetected because that's only processed
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
by registration and not with a
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
title any other questions
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you taking my question um can you
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
explain the process and what happens if
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
you have a vehicle that's been titled
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
out of state and the previous owner
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
can't be found and how is there a a
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism for transferring that title
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
even though the previous owner may not
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
be available anymore or so there's a
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different scenarios
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure that we're on the
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
same page um Susie lives out in Montana
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh she was the last titled owner for a
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
2015 Honda transfers it to you and then
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
Susie is no longer you can't get a hold
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
of her and she transferred it without a
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
title is that the correct scenario yes
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
so what our Bureau would instruct you to
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
do is take every Avenue that you can to
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
try and make contact with this customer
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
customer we have certain documentations
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
certain verifications through local law
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement inspection station or
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
dealerships that can verify the VIN
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
number on there generally an individual
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
is not taking ownership of a vehicle
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
without at least a bill of sale so
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's information um that you would be
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
able to provide to us along with a kind
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
of a synopsis of what you've gone
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
through and there is an option um
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
through approval uh through the director
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
is design that we would allow for a
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
defective title Bond so there is is that
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh scenario and we and we do see those
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
we have people that are stuck in
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
situations such as that where they just
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
have exhausted every effort cannot get a
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
hold of the last titled owner we can see
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the National Database that Susie was
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
the last titled owner um and even though
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
Montana won't provide that title to us
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
we can confirm whether it's been
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
reported as a theft or salvaged or
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
rebuilt any of those um through our
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
research and then through additional
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
research using other systems that are
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
available to us we're able to determine
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no fraud intended and then
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
we can move forward and allow the
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
customer um and effective title
 
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.069 align:start position:0%
customer um and effective title
Bond

00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
Bond
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
follow how long does that process
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
typically take it can it can take some
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
time it all depends on what information
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
the customer has provided to us it has
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
to go through a review process again
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
there's other systems that we work with
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh the National Database if we need to
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
reach out to the previous state to get
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
additional information it's all in what
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
their response time is to us once we
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
have everything we need um if it looks
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
like there's no fraud intended that you
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
have exhausted all your resources then
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
it'll go up for approval process and
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
then we'll send out a letter that would
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
allow you to take to your insurance
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
company and get a defective title Bond
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Jones Thank Mr
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
um turn your mic on rep on now okay
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
um I just want to
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
ask the title is that the one tool that
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
carries the correct VIN number through
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
the life of a car I mean if you don't
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
have that's the only real identification
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the VIN number I mean you
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
can register a car and use a VIN number
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
but no one ever goes out to the physical
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
car and checks the VIN number um that's
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
a great question um there are other
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
tools so for non- tileable Motor
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
Vehicles there are requirements that
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
either the customer needs to present to
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
us not just proof of ownership which
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
would be the bill of sale but as well as
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
Vin verification so if a previous title
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
is present then we can take a copy of
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
that if the previous owner's
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
registration is available we can take a
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
copy of that or we have a specific form
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh which is a TDM v9a which is a VIN
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
verification form where the bin is
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
verified by either a licensed New
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealer a licensed New
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inspection inspection station
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
or a New Hampshire law enforcement
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
officer and there are different spots on
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
the vehicles where these vins are placed
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
and these individuals are trained to
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
check multiple spots to verify the VIN
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
on the vehicle before completing those
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
forms and that's what's required in
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
order to obtain a registration um and
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
show proof of
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
ownership follow yep
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
follow so actually one that this build
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
isn't affect it doesn't affect that at
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
all because there is a VIN verification
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
there is a VIN verification that's
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
correct however what we are not going to
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
be able to track is anything that's
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
attached to the titling of a vehicle
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
when you get this Vin verification done
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
you're not able to see is there a
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
salvage brand is there a rebuilt brand
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
was this part of a flood has there is
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
this part of a theft are there other
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
factors uh put into that thank you
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking my question is
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
there any National Database of the VIN
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
numbers once the automakers create a car
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
create a VIN number and is there any
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
database that would then have any
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
information associated with the what
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
happened to the car we do have a
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
database that we can utilize through
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
nicb um um that will show where it was
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured who manufactured it what
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
country it was in the VIN number is
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
broken down in certain characteristics
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
there is a formula to this um and then
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
once it's first
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
sold um even if it's put out to a uh
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
franchise dealership that is noted and
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
we start tracking that in other
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
databases as well so there is a way to
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
follow the life of a vehicle as long as
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
else seeing none Brad while I'm thinking
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
about it um when you're looking through
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
2015 for intent uh can you look at what
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Salvage dealers
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
position was I'm surprised not to see
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
them here today uh with that I'm going
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing and host
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%

you uh a couple of minutes we'll go into
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:54:02.950 align:start position:0%
you uh a couple of minutes we'll go into
1044

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
1044 relative to the non-mandatory
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
issuance of certificates of title for
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
certain vehicles and the chair
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
 
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.150 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
representative

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
morning good morning and I thank you um
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and um for the record I am Lisa
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
post from
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
liboro this bill is a constituent bill
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and uh this would
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
allow a non-mandatory titling of
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
vehicles older than
 
00:54:43.799 --> 00:54:46.030 align:start position:0%
vehicles older than
2000

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
2000
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill will help people when they
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
are able to use a title and then sell it
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
a sell a vehicle or or a um a vehicle or
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
a trailer that's under 3,000 lb in
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
another state where they must have a
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
title to sell that vehicle or trailer um
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
and this was a process we went through
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
we have done it before and uh in a
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
transaction recently that we had um we
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
were told by the DMV and title
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
department that that transaction was no
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
longer valid because they've interpreted
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
things differently now so this cuts off
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
people from selling a vehicle in other
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
states and now we know that vehicles are
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
being bought from all over the country
 
00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:42.150 align:start position:0%
being bought from all over the country
and

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
sold all over the country so this will
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
help folks that want to sell their
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that they no longer want and be
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
able to title that vehicle or that uh
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
trailer and although I if you look in
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
um on the estimated impact as an
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
increase over the years
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that exponentially
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that we're just going
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
to have a runon by everybody to run to
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
their Town clerks to to get titled
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
um a vehicle they want to sell out of
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
state it's it's a very seldom thing uh
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
every few years we have a handful of
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
people that do this um and so I I don't
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
believe these numbers are an accurate
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
reflection because most people who have
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
older vehicles that purchase them and
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
use either a VIN verification or a
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
previous registration from the owner
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
along with that bill of title uh they
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend the $25 because they
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
have an old car and they're going to use
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
it they're going to beat it up and
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be done with it and buy
 
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
another one just like it so I I believe
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
this is um in the best interest of our
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
um customers that they are able to um
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
have a title and it's just polar
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
opposite of the the two bills that we
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
had before um and and I hope you'll take
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
this into
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
consideration uh for folks that um need
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
to sell a vehicle and have have a buyer
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
in another state and um we we have that
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
issue also um coming in from like
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont where um some
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
in New York where they don't have titles
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
and we have to use other things for it
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
um but we are a titling State and so for
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
these few people that use them every
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
year uh I hope you will support this and
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
I'll take any
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you actually I
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
do have one just the way it's written um
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
do you see there is an Avenue excuse the
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
transportation metaphor for the
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles to
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
deny a a title say it's for an example
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
if it's a 1997 and you're requesting a
 
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.630 align:start position:0%
if it's a 1997 and you're requesting a
title

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
title
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh what if according to their records it
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
was reported stolen in 2004 I'm just I
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
don't see in the language where would
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
give them the ability to say no we're
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
not giving a title for it because it
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
stolen I didn't consider that in all
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
with we have the ability to look at
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
previous titles so and and and the the
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
DMV does have the ability to go into
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
these um these
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um I forget what you call them but but
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
the databases that are used for this so
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
they can find it through the database so
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could put in something in
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
this bill that indicates that we must
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
check to see for a previous
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
title yeah fair enough it's not
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteed correct okay any other
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the Comm
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
you very much and have a great day you
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
too next up Jennifer once again title
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
day in transportation from the
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicle not taking a
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
bill good morning chairman and members
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you again for
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
taking time to speak with me
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
um we only have a couple of talking
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
points here so as spoken about in
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony our current
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
turnaround time is less than three weeks
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
we shoot for the two we turnaround time
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
to get titles processed and out the door
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
by allowing extra titles to come in and
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
individuals who would fall under what is
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
currently our exempt vehicle law uh
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
2613 that would increase our workload
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that would slow down our turnaround
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
time as representative post had
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's only a few every
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
year that would be looking to do this
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
that would be just based off of one
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
municipality we have to take into
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
consideration there are 234
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities there are multiple
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and multiple members of
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
society that would be looking to do this
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
and once we allow this for one we have
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
to allow for all others so one of the
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
questions that was asked was would we be
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
able to check the National Database for
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
stolen last titled so on and so forth
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually uh one of the steps that
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
we take currently for our antique
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so any vehicle who has
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
completed its 25th year and in its 26th
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
year can be classified as an antique
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
may be eligible for a title and that may
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a title means that they
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
have to meet certain criteria and one of
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
those criteria is that they have to turn
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
in the last issued title and we check
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
those National databases to see when the
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
last title was issued so we'll go back
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
to the same scenario with Montana on a
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
question asked in the previous Bill if I
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
purchase a vehicle that is a 1995 it
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for an antique test
 
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.750 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for an antique test
title

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
title
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
application if the title examiner
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
discovers that back in 2020 a title was
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
issued out of Montana and I don't have
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
that to turn in with my application my
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
application for antique title would be
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
denied because that is the number one
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
thing that would have to be turned in we
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
would allow additional supporting
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
documentation to be submitted if a
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
previous title has gone a number of
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
years uh without being eligible or valid
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
or available ailable so there are
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
certain mechanisms and certain ways to
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
to track these but we do deny
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
applications if they don't meet certain
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's something that
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
we do for some of the exempt vehicles
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
that qualify as an
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
antique so when we look at um we're
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
currently issuing 400,000 titles on
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
average per year and increasing that
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
like we talked about before would
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
increase a turnaround time it would have
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
an impact on consumers it would have an
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
impact on lenders and it have an impact
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
on the dealer Association as
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you I'll ask you
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
the same question the way this
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill is written do you still
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to deny if somebody
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
requests a non-mandatory title I believe
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
with the terminology that says may would
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
allow us the
 
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.269 align:start position:0%
allow us the
ability

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you representative
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
SES thank you for letting me uh ask a
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little late to the garden
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
party here so bear with me for a minute
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't I I wish you would explain
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
to me more carefully what the difference
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
is that this bill how it would change
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
261 colon 3 of existing law already
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
correct so it says no in 2613 for exempt
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicles it says no certificate of title
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
need be attained for so that means that
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
we are not going to produce a title
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
because it is not a requirement under um
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute and that lists all
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
of these so um goes into discuss a ton
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
of different things it does talk about
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
trailers with gross weight of less than
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
3,1 pounds any motor vehicle whose
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer model year is before the
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
year 2000 except for heavy trucks and
 
01:03:50.839 --> 01:03:53.269 align:start position:0%
year 2000 except for heavy trucks and
truck

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
tractors follow up so I guess a fair
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
summation of that would be that this
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
will allow consumers
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
further provide Providence for older
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles and and and and as a corollary
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
to that it would allow them more more
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
easily to sell these vehicles it would
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
allow them to voluntarily place an
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
application on file for title with us it
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
would not be required for them to do so
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
um and then they would have a
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
certificate of title which does booler
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
their um their ownership for that
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank you you're
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions from the
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee I do have one more statement
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
if there's no further questions sure one
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have to keep in
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
mind if it's an exempt vehicle and a
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
title has been issued it does not mean
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
that an individual has to sell it with
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
the title so if I opted to title A a
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
trailer that was a 2023 trailer with
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
only 3,000
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
gbwr I'm going to have that title but
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
then my nextd door neighbor can go and
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
write a bill of sale to one of you and
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
the system is not going to flag anything
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
it's not going to show that my neighbor
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
was not the rightful owner to be able to
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
sell that because it's not required to
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
have a title in order to sell that type
 
01:05:20.039 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
have a title in order to sell that type
of

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
morning thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
to speak today HB 1138 was born out of
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
the work of the HB 1188 commission to
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
study the use of ohvs in New Hampshire
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
the commission is made up of 17 members
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
representing ohrv users dealers
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions legislators
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
citizens of the North country and the
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
relevant public agencies the commission
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
has heard repeatedly that the majority
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
of bad behavior surrounding Ohr vus is
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
committed by a very small number of
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders while discussing many
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
possible remedies for these issues this
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
was one that was highlighted by members
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee this is merely trying
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
to rectify confusion with the current
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
RSA surrounding operation of an ohrv
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
after revocation of a license to a lay
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
person like myself it seems that the
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
language in the in RSA 25 a29 is meant
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
to delegate the sense to the sentencing
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
laid out in RSA 264 for other Motor
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicles in actuality it seems that a
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
loophole exists where violators are
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
assessed a much lower fine without
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
escalation for repeat offenses this bill
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
intends to make clear the legislature's
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
intent by directly adding the language
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
from RSA 264 into RSA 215 I'm happy to
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
answer any questions U but I believe
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
Captain Eastman from fishing game is
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
here he may be better equipped to
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
explain the enforcement as aspect of
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and where the confusion and
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
from that's a pretty good Escape does
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
that mean you won't take any questions
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if anybody has them
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
much now I don't have a card from
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
Captain Eastman oh I never mind I
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
do chair recognizes Captain Eastman from
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
h of fishing
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
game one time no see how are you great
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
how are you chairman Walsh and members
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for allowing
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
me to speak today um this has been uh so
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
to start out uh the requirement is that
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
um over the when you became 16 or over
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
and you're going to operate an O HRV or
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
snowmobile you are required to have a
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license and good standing um so
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
in that this law has been on the books
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
probably since the late 70s early 80s um
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
in where um it was a handful of people
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
who had ohvs and uh once again they had
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
to have a license of good standing uh
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
now fast forward to 2024 we have a lot
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
more ohvs and snowmobiles out there
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
operating um in different uh manners and
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh so this really comes from what has
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
been a pet peeve of mine for some time
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
probably about 24 years in where um when
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
you have an operator of a snow machine
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
or an ohrv um and they have a suspended
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
driver's license due to whatever reason
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicle suspends
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
their driver's license outside of DWIs
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature which there is
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
a enhanced penalty for that within ohrv
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
and snowmobile
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
law what occurs currently under this
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
this law is that if someone has a
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
suspended driver's license and they
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
operate one of those two vehicles um
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
they are assessed a fine of
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
$186 now they
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
can pay that fine go on get continue to
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
to violate and all they are assessed is
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
an 8886 fine and throughout my career I
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
have seen this where um they're like
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
well I just pay the fine and I continue
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
to operate my snowmobile um what this
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill would do would change that kind of
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
bring us into into where we are in New
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with ohrv use and parody this
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
with motor vehicle law where if you
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
violate once it's a $250 fine and then
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
if you decide to violate that after the
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
fact it then is enhanced you know within
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
that 7-year period as it is in motor
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle law and would then enhance the
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
fine and enhance the penalty um like a
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much anybody any
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative St
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
Clair thank
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
you just a quick guess how many people
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
you run up against where you they pay
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
the fine and keep doing it um I've had a
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
handful over over my career um where we
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
saw this more was um and why we really
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
suggested this within the oer commission
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's in your bigger events like um
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
Jericho ATV Festival um events like that
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
um some of the snowmobile events where
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
you start to see more people coming out
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
and operating and then you tend to see
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh people that have suspended driver's
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
license that are that are operating um
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
ohvs and all
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
else thank
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
else wow and I have nobody else signed
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
up thank you Captain thank you um and
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
just for everybody too I don't know if
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed I filed all of our
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
early bills today so we can we can look
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
at the policy of something like this as
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
a decision for this committee and I
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
assume it'll be going to probably
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice afterwards to to look
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
at the rest of it in terms of
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
how it applies with nothing else on it
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public hearing on House
 
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.470 align:start position:0%

03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'd like to present 1304
 
03:04:42.750 --> 03:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
to you bottom line is the currently
 
03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
state Hampshire is out of compliance
 
03:04:46.030 --> 03:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
with federal
 
03:04:49.229 --> 03:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
law uh Coast Guard US Coast Guard came
 
03:04:53.309 --> 03:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
down and said that we could not charge
 
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
additional fees for boat registration
 
03:04:58.269 --> 03:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
currently state in the Hampshire charges
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
for the boat registration and then tax
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
on fees for fishing game for peace Air
 
03:05:09.309 --> 03:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
Force uh commission and for Dees and
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
that is in violation of federal law so
 
03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
three years ago this came to r and i
 
03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
chaired the uh committee on that and
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
then this committee approved a study a
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
sub a study committee last year so what
 
03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
1304 is is a result of that study
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee that you commissioned last
 
03:05:32.830 --> 03:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
year you bottom line is uh study
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
committee met uh twice and the solution
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
that we came up with uh with unanimous
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
um agreement across the board was to to
 
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
establish a second sticker so the first
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
sticker registers your boat no change to
 
03:05:51.550 --> 03:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
cost no change to
 
03:05:54.750 --> 03:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
procedure the second sticker accounts
 
03:05:56.349 --> 03:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
for those State
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
fees that are charged there is no change
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
to the state fees for the second sticker
 
03:06:06.229 --> 03:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
so the same $950 the same $1 that you're
 
03:06:08.110 --> 03:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
paying fishing game for search and
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
rescue All That Remains the Same there
 
03:06:14.670 --> 03:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
is an additional three $3 cost which is
 
03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the sticker itself and so
 
03:06:20.590 --> 03:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
that that will be added on to the second
 
03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
sticker and so uh the committee looked
 
03:06:27.150 --> 03:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
at this we created the bill and then uh
 
03:06:29.950 --> 03:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
it was discovered one that in the bill
 
03:06:31.710 --> 03:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
it says where do you put the sticker on
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
the boat well that's already in RSA
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's already defined in rules and so
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh we took that out in the amendment
 
03:06:42.510 --> 03:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's in front of you the second thing
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
was a Comm Comm sense thing it said wait
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
a minute if we start this thing in June
 
03:06:47.640 --> 03:06:48.830 align:start position:0%
a minute if we start this thing in June
of

03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:06:50.830 --> 03:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
20424 that's in the middle of boting
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
season it makes no sense let's push it
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
out to January 25 which is when everyone
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
registers to bootes and so you see an
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you that strikes
 
03:07:04.030 --> 03:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
one paragraph not needed already in
 
03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
rules and then kicks the bill
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
implementation date out until January
 
03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
25 so that is commensurate with the
 
03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
25 so that is commensurate with the
boting

03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
boting
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
season um that's it with this bill we
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
are in compliance with federal law we
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
preserve the $4.1 million a year that
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
the feds give us that they otherwise
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
would take
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
away and we continue on with no
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
additional cost outside of the
 
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
$3 which is actual payment of the
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
sticker subject any questions I request
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%

03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
question now that we have two stickers a
 
03:08:04.950 --> 03:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
registration sticker and a and a fee
 
03:08:07.150 --> 03:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
sticker call it can
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
anybody get a registration sticker in
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
any state now and still use it in New
 
03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:13.790 align:start position:0%
any state now and still use it in New
Hampshire

03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:08:16.750 --> 03:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
technically this does not change that to
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
the the the rules that apply for out of
 
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
state stickers still
 
03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
apply this does not touch the out ofate
 
03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:27.830 align:start position:0%
apply this does not touch the out ofate
sticker

03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
process sure further
 
03:08:31.279 --> 03:08:33.070 align:start position:0%
process sure further
questions

03:08:33.070 --> 03:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.000 --> 03:09:03.429 align:start position:0%
 
C

03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.990 --> 03:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's in there sir if you go to the next
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
page under section two it's it's based
 
03:09:12.750 --> 03:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
on the second sticker so those know if
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
you look the
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
$950 the $1 $5 $2 all that's identical
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we added to that
 
03:09:23.469 --> 03:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
section was the $3 for the sticker
 
03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
itself yeah it might be confusing are
 
03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
you looking at the amendment that's
 
03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's there as
 
03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
well let's yeah well let's get to that
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
in a second um because one at a time we
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
haven't officially adopted the amendment
 
03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
yet but we will talk about it um any
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee so I
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
guess I will ask the same question you
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
were getting at on the Amendment and and
 
03:09:46.590 --> 03:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do this is uh just so we have we
 
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh are all on the on the same
 
03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
page you said you rem you want to remove
 
03:09:55.070 --> 03:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
line A2 on the amendment because already
 
03:09:55.080 --> 03:09:56.469 align:start position:0%
line A2 on the amendment because already
in

03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
rules that's already in rules but and so
 
03:10:01.150 --> 03:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
if you go to register your boat they'll
 
03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
tell you put it right here right but it
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt to leave it in statute um
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
if we decided to correctly if you'd like
 
03:10:09.150 --> 03:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
to do that Mr Sherman that'd be fine
 
03:10:11.429 --> 03:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
it's nice to have a statute back up a
 
03:10:13.469 --> 03:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
rule seeing as how that's they're
 
03:10:16.269 --> 03:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
they're more binding so okay uh any
 
03:10:18.670 --> 03:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%

1304 uh I am Amy smagula I'm a
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
freshwater biologist with the Department
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services where I
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate the exotic species program
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
that program is the recipient of
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
$9.50 per vessel uh under existing
 
03:11:11.790 --> 03:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and under the decal program
 
03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's proposed before for you uh and I
 
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
provided a letter on behalf of Dees that
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
outlines the use of that fee that comes
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
into our agency and some additional
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
information for you I just wanted to
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that the fees that
 
03:11:32.349 --> 03:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
are collected are important to the state
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
we do receive a lot of instate and
 
03:11:37.389 --> 03:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
transient voters and others who use our
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
water bodies and uh the programs that
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
receive the funding that would be
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
packaged into this
 
03:11:46.030 --> 03:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
decal fee uh support critical State
 
03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
programs that help protect the health
 
03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
the Integrity the accessibility the
 
03:11:52.510 --> 03:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
navigability and the safety of our
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
surface water so uh this is a good fix
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
for the issue relative to the Coast
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
Guard statute um the money that comes
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
into the dees program goes right back
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
out mostly As grants to municipalities
 
03:12:09.510 --> 03:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
and nonprofit groups to help mitigate
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
impacts of invasive species in our water
 
03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
bodies we we have uh about a hundred
 
03:12:16.670 --> 03:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
water bodies that have invasive species
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
in them and uh they do cause problems
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
for use of our water bodies so the money
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
is uh useful for grants for that purpose
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
and um it's a good way to capture that
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
um boers are the primary means of spread
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
of invasive species so the fee is
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate attached to boers um we
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
don't take a position on this bill but
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
we just did want to provide that
 
03:12:43.950 --> 03:12:43.960 align:start position:0%

and spread management of aquatic
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
invasive species New Hampshire Lakes we
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
are a recipient of a grant from the
 
03:13:53.590 --> 03:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services um
 
03:13:56.830 --> 03:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
we through this um the funds that U Mrs
 
03:14:00.190 --> 03:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
Mula mentioned we run uh a courtesy boat
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
inspection program if you've ever
 
03:14:03.349 --> 03:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
launched a boat on a lake in New
 
03:14:04.990 --> 03:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you might have run into a blue
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
shirted person called a lake host
 
03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
teaching you how to prevent the spread
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
of invasive species um so we receive a
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
grant from to run that program but that
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
Grant leverages U about three times the
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
amount of funding from local communities
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
so we use the grant funds to to leverage
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
a lot more community support for our
 
03:14:26.590 --> 03:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes so I urge you to support this bill

unit and I I thank you for your time as
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
we uh as as you have heard from those
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
before me uh this bill is the result of
 
03:15:15.150 --> 03:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
a desk audit that happens every couple
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
of years by the Coast Guard of the
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol program ensuring that it
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
follows the requirements of Grant
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
dollars that we received from the Coast
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
Guard uh with our boating safety program
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh about three years ago it was
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
discovered we were collecting fees at
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
the time of the boat registration
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
transaction that were in violation of
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
federal law essentially the Coast Guard
 
03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
wants a person to be able to go to the
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
DMV or the town hall uh substation and
 
03:15:46.510 --> 03:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
be able to just register their boat and
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
have these other fees that New
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's been collecting for years be
 
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
bated from that initial financial
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
transaction as you heard uh through the
 
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
work of of numerous people um what you
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
have before you today is a work product
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
that satisfies the Coast Guard satisfies
 
03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
the the fact that a person can have
 
03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
those fees in that transaction separated
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
from the registration transaction ction
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
and then the collection of those other
 
03:16:16.830 --> 03:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
fees that are critical to our partners
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
here in state for a variety of uh very
 
03:16:21.189 --> 03:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
important topics whether it be the
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
Aquatic invasives search and rescue
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
Public Access and for the PE uh the Port
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Authority down the pe's development uh
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
their dredge fund which if you are from
 
03:16:33.870 --> 03:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
the coast understand the challenges they
 
03:16:35.710 --> 03:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
have with dredging so these these
 
03:16:38.110 --> 03:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
dollars are critical to our partners uh
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
and this uh bill before you is a
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
solution to that and I'm happy to answer
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have thank you sir
 
03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you again
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
one quick thing Mr chairman you
 
03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh addressing in the amendment
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
um the aspect of rules I will tell you
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
our current rules regarding the
 
03:17:00.429 --> 03:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
placement of decal are by reference to
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements of the decal
 
03:17:05.910 --> 03:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
placement so um that Amendment actually
 
03:17:08.349 --> 03:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
does have some importance because we
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
reference them uh we cite them by
 
03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
reference in the rules when the Fed
 
03:17:14.550 --> 03:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
change because they always do New
 
03:17:16.269 --> 03:17:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is automatically caught up
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
just because it's in reference so for
 
03:17:19.189 --> 03:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
what that's worth thank you very much
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
for clarity thank you very much and I'd
 
03:17:22.710 --> 03:17:22.720 align:start position:0%

I'm Lucius parall representing marbor
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%

03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
1617
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
the essence of the bill is to enforce
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
Federal EPA regulations around exhaust
 
03:24:19.870 --> 03:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
modification tampering with a Vehicles
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
Miss mission control system is illegal
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
under the Clean Air Act and causes
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
excess pollutants to the air re breath
 
03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
up to 40 to 100 times the emissions of a
 
03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:29.150 align:start position:0%
up to 40 to 100 times the emissions of a
standard

03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle the CIA also prohibits
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing selling offering for sale
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
and installing aftermarket devices which
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
effectively defeat these
 
03:24:40.830 --> 03:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
controls the EPA has a national
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
compliance ini and I have several dozen
 
03:24:44.070 --> 03:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
links that I would be happy to share
 
03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
with you electronically that's way you
 
03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
want them on they computer links uh if
 
03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:49.389 align:start position:0%
want them on they computer links uh if
you

03:24:49.389 --> 03:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:24:52.870 --> 03:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
ask um they highlight the success that
 
03:24:53.950 --> 03:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
they have in Prosecuting the
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
Distributors of these Mission defeating
 
03:24:58.469 --> 03:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
devices however they do not Patrol the
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
streets of our communities and this
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
creates a problem that needs a
 
03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:03.389 align:start position:0%
creates a problem that needs a
Grassroots

03:25:03.389 --> 03:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
Grassroots
 
03:25:05.550 --> 03:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
answer several states have enacted
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
legislation reinforcing the illegality
 
03:25:09.189 --> 03:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
of emissions modification they include
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
Maine Utah New Jersey Marland Colorado
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut now I've witnessed coal
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
rolling on at least two occasions one
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
one a group of citizens in in the square
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
in Key New Hampshire were assembled to
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
promote a social justice issue and a
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
loud Jer from a passing motorist in a
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
white pickup preceded a blast of carbon
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
exhaust that resulted in several people
 
03:25:33.309 --> 03:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
people becoming ill and the others you
 
03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
know I mean there's numerous stories of
 
03:25:36.910 --> 03:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
people having this happen in fact you
 
03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
can go online I it's not part my written
 
03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you can go online type in
 
03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
Rolling C on YouTube and you can find
 
03:25:45.950 --> 03:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
all sorts of examples of people engaging
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
in this kind of behavior and gleefully
 
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
sharing the results of it but in 2021
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
six training for a road race were
 
03:25:55.630 --> 03:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
run over by a 16-year-old who was
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
rolling coal along business US Highway
 
03:26:01.870 --> 03:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
290 in uh in Texas outside Houston um he
 
03:26:03.389 --> 03:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't happy with his first attempt he
 
03:26:04.510 --> 03:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's got a little too close to and
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
several of them were hospitalized
 
03:26:06.910 --> 03:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
his attempt to uh
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
well to engage what I would consider to
 
03:26:14.910 --> 03:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
be a pointless activity so this is
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
clearly a practice that has no purpose
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
but to inspire acts of road rage at a
 
03:26:20.110 --> 03:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
time when there are already enough
 
03:26:22.590 --> 03:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
incidents of independent uh when we
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
already have enough incidents
 
03:26:26.590 --> 03:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
independent rolling coal by enforcing
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
existing federal law on a state level we
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
can better manage this Odus act and help
 
03:26:33.150 --> 03:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
calm new New Hampshire
 
03:26:36.429 --> 03:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
highways thank you thank you sir
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:26:41.189 --> 03:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee really oh representative Jones
 
03:26:42.429 --> 03:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
I so you
 
03:26:45.469 --> 03:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
you representative um the uh the
 
03:26:52.990 --> 03:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
violation the fine of not to exceed
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 was was that already in the RSA
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
or did you put that in there um I added
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
that to the uh no that's not in the
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's no this this would be an
 
03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to our current Sr RSA there's
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in COD right now I arrived at
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
that figure from looking at what some of
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
the other states were doing I think it
 
03:27:11.670 --> 03:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
was you don't quote me I think was New
 
03:27:14.590 --> 03:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
Jersey and Colorado have the maximum
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
fine of that and it seems reasonable to
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
me thank
 
03:27:22.110 --> 03:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
you did I see another hand over there
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative sellers you're outet yeah
 
03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:29.670 align:start position:0%
representative sellers you're outet yeah
representative

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:33.309 --> 03:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you this is my real seat over
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
here um I thought you had mentioned that
 
03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
um this is illegal federally yes um so
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
why is it that we need this well because
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
basically the Environmental Protection
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
Agency is not in the business of
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
patrolling our highways and this will
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
give the our local police authority to
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
pull somebody over and if they have been
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh rolling coal and inspect their
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
emissions and find what's been tampered
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
with right now I don't believe they have
 
03:28:05.790 --> 03:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
that Authority although I would love to
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
be corrected if I'm wrong I don't
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe they have the authority to do
 
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
you um any other questions from the
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative C thank you for
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh would this uh in
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
any way affect the vehicle inspections
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
when somebody takes their car in for
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
inspection yes and it should because
 
03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
modifying the exhaust in this way is
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.199 --> 03:28:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
law

03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman uh so just a
 
03:28:48.510 --> 03:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
quick question on it um who who does the
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
modifications is it do shops do it or I
 
03:28:52.830 --> 03:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
mean I'm just curious if You' looked
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
into that at all you know I actually
 
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
have not looked into any great de deal
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
but I do know that of those links that I
 
03:29:01.229 --> 03:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
was saying yeah these are EPA
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutions of manufacturers of devices
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
that people buy to put on their truck in
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
order to make this happen so my guess
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
would be it probably be somebody putting
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
their truck up in their usually I drive
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
a truck you know nothing against trucks
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
but putting their truck up in the
 
03:29:19.710 --> 03:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
backyard and uh doing it thems okay I
 
03:29:21.389 --> 03:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
believe but you know but don't quote me
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
so anybody else actually I do have one
 
03:29:28.349 --> 03:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
and it may and if it did get asked
 
03:29:30.990 --> 03:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
already I apologize was talking with
 
03:29:32.590 --> 03:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else have you looked through
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
our statutes that we currently have I
 
03:29:38.229 --> 03:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
thought we had currently rsas to deal
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
with excessive smoke for any reason not
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
just for something like this well this
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
is this is specific to adding uh a
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
device that is has the sole purpose of
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
generating these kind of files it's an
 
03:29:55.790 --> 03:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
intentional I don't think it's necessary
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a strong need to go after
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
the diesel truck uh driver who's behind
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
on his repairs and might be out of
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
compliance that's not my goal with the
 
03:30:08.110 --> 03:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this no I understood
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
but I believe there's already something
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the books you would know I though and
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
if there is you know I would more and
 
03:30:15.870 --> 03:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
willing to be corrected on that but I I
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
did go through what I could from what I
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
could see I not see anything that a fact
 
03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody else from the
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you again
 
03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
you this is an early Bill yes all of the
 
03:30:34.269 --> 03:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
bills today are early
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
bills uh next up chair recognizes Becky

bill

03:30:57.670 --> 03:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh Becky Yer Department of
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um I'm in the air
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
Resources Division and have worked for
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
almost 25 years in the in the uh realm
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
of trying to control emissions from the
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
Transportation sector um I think that
 
03:31:13.870 --> 03:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill answered or
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
addressed many of the points that I
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
would like to make about this I've
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
handed around a fact sheet from the
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency so I
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
won't repeat um what he said other than
 
03:31:27.550 --> 03:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
to reiterate that federal law does make
 
03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
this a a a violation it's a federal
 
03:31:32.710 --> 03:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
federal violation for tampering with or
 
03:31:35.710 --> 03:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
bypassing an emissions vehicle Vehicles
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
emission control device um both selling
 
03:31:41.469 --> 03:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
such devices and installing those
 
03:31:43.950 --> 03:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
devices are also a violation of federal
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
law but absent of federal law I mean
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
absent of state law that also makes this
 
03:31:54.150 --> 03:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
illegal um there's no way for local or
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
State Police to pull over the vehicles
 
03:31:57.469 --> 03:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
that they see that are in violation of
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
this we do not have a a state statute
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
which they can cite as a
 
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
violation um there was a question about
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
how does this impact the vehicle
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
inspections and one of the things about
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
about some of these devices not all
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's multiple ways to do this you can
 
03:32:17.309 --> 03:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
you can either just completely bypass
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
your your exhaust control equipment in
 
03:32:20.630 --> 03:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
which case it's going to smoke all the
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
time and then you can have a device that
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
dumps extra fuel into the into the um
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
engine that just simply overpowers the
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
control device um multiple ways of doing
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
it but not all of those are detectable
 
03:32:36.189 --> 03:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
in the vehicle inspection there's
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
particularly those that are add-on
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
devices you can turn the device off and
 
03:32:42.830 --> 03:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
you can pass any tailpipe test that that
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh any state is going to throw at you so
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
unless the um inspector knows to
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
actually look for a specific device it
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
may it may pass inspection and then you
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
know leave the garage go around the
 
03:32:57.550 --> 03:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
corner and and uh and roll Co on some
 
03:32:57.560 --> 03:32:58.389 align:start position:0%
corner and and uh and roll Co on some
poor

03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
poor
 
03:32:58.399 --> 03:33:00.110 align:start position:0%
poor
unsuspecting

03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting
 
03:33:00.120 --> 03:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting
individual

03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
um we do already have this is this
 
03:33:11.469 --> 03:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
emission stat uh statue in a site but um
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
the modifications some it was asked who
 
03:33:15.150 --> 03:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
does the modifications and the mod
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
modifications again can be done by shops
 
03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
that that illegally sell add-on devices
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
but again they can also be done in the
 
03:33:25.870 --> 03:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
backyard um and just simply putting in a
 
03:33:28.429 --> 03:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
a an extra fuel line that you've got the
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
ability to turn off and on from the cab
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
and it can just simply overwhelm the you
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
basically dump more fuel into the engine
 
03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
than it can possibly burn and it just
 
03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
comes out the tailpipe is as smoke
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
so uh New Hampshire Dees would very much
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
like to see these specifically Bann in
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and again this would give
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
local and state law enforcement the
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
tools that they need to be able to
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
enforce these because they if they don't
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a local statute that they can that
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
they can uh pin the violation to they're
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to uh impose all that
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
extra paperwork on themselves uh to try
 
03:34:13.229 --> 03:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
to turn around inside the federal
 
03:34:15.790 --> 03:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much questions from
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
the committee representative rumo thank
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
you um Miss I don't know if this is best
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
directed to you or to sponsor but I'm
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
was looking at the
 
03:34:29.830 --> 03:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
language um that you prohibits you these
 
03:34:31.150 --> 03:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
modifications that would release
 
03:34:33.870 --> 03:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
significant quantities of s smoke or
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
other particular emissions I I looked
 
03:34:38.189 --> 03:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
quickly I was trying to see whether in
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
the existing statue where that's defined
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
or how that would the parameters would
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
be set What's significant in terms from
 
03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
perspective yeah that's that I can't
 
03:34:52.990 --> 03:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
address that but that is a good catch
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
that it probably needs to be more
 
03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
specifically defined that would be
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
either in excess of of the design factor
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
for that vehicle I mean each each motor
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle has um you know specific
 
03:35:10.189 --> 03:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
parameters in which they must in which
 
03:35:12.990 --> 03:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
they are designed to operate and so
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
anything that that um tampers with that
 
03:35:16.439 --> 03:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
anything that that um tampers with that
operational

03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
operational
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
design uh would be considered tampering
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
with the vehicle okay thank you anybody
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
else from the
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
you next up and
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
I thought I had one more card but I do
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
not so with that I'm going to close the
 
03:36:07.389 --> 03:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bille for
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
1447 and next up
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
five minutes seven minutes or so uh
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.479 --> 03:44:45.309 align:start position:0%
 
1543

03:44:45.309 --> 03:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on host Bill 1543 FN relative to
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
personal electric vehicles uh chair
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
 
03:44:55.199 --> 03:45:03.630 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
representative

03:45:03.630 --> 03:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.189 --> 03:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
goou okay thank you uh Mr chairman and
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I
 
03:45:12.189 --> 03:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill one 543 FN
 
03:45:14.670 --> 03:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
because uh there is a need and there
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
will be a need to protect people both on
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
our Pathways and our roads as these uh
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
personal electric vehicles become more
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
common uh and this these protections are
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
not just
 
03:45:31.710 --> 03:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
for um the people affected by the pevs
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
but also the people using the personal
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and I understand there
 
03:45:38.910 --> 03:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
are at least 50 people supporting this
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill now online line or wherever the
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
numbers are versus only one or two
 
03:45:46.750 --> 03:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
opposing it and
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh let me see I'm
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
sorry oh thank goodness um I'm sorry uh
 
03:45:57.309 --> 03:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
there if you have any questions uh you
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
will definitely don't feel feel very
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
free to ask any questions you have
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
because I have been asking questions
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
myself there are a lot of uh there's a
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
lot of uh new information about these
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
things that we don't know about yet
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
because they haven't been around too
 
03:46:13.750 --> 03:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
much but they will be increasing more
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and more and that's why this bill is
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
being put in to be proactive for all the
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
needs that will be coming up um Mr topam
 
03:46:25.469 --> 03:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
will be explaining more about the bill
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
than I he knows all the technical
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
aspects of this particular Bill and
 
03:46:30.990 --> 03:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
these issues he has been involved with
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
bicycling advocacy for since
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
1971 and he is on the board of uh five
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
rail trail advocacy groups in New
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hampshire and he's
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
also and he's also involved or on the um
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
on committees and commissions of the
 
03:46:50.349 --> 03:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire including the
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission so if you have
 
03:46:54.429 --> 03:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
any questions he should be able to
 
03:46:56.670 --> 03:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
answer them hopefully I feel he is one
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the most knowledgeable persons in the
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
whole state of New Hampshire about this
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
issue so uh he'll answer anything that
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
he possibly can for you so um thank you
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
very much for hearing this bill and and
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully uh when it passes it'll
 
03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
make the people safer here in the state
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire thank you very
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you very
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
much I guess I'll mention it now if you
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
do wish to speak on this bill because I
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
did mention a name I don't have a pink
 
03:47:27.630 --> 03:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
card for I need a pink card uh if you
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't wish to if you don't wish to speak
 
03:47:32.670 --> 03:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
just sign the blue sheets for or against
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh that being said chair recognizes next
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
up representative Pearson in support of
 
03:47:37.520 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
up representative Pearson in support of
the

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:49.070 align:start position:0%
the
bill

03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's uh it's nice
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
to be back in a single
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
room I did miss those last
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
turn for the record my name is
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
03:48:02.830 --> 03:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
District 13 which encompasses the town
 
03:48:02.840 --> 03:48:04.189 align:start position:0%
District 13 which encompasses the town
of

03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:48:04.199 --> 03:48:06.030 align:start position:0%
of
dairy

03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
dairy
 
03:48:08.830 --> 03:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
I to avoid confusion I also sit on the
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
board of director for der's Rail Trail
 
03:48:13.950 --> 03:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
Association der's Rail Trail Association
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
has not taken up this legislation and
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
has no opinion and I want to make it
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
clear I'm not speaking on behalf of that
 
03:48:25.710 --> 03:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
board so one of the things
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
that in a way has come full circle
 
03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:32.469 align:start position:0%
that in a way has come full circle
technologically

03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
is taking what we have traditionally
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
used with an internal combustion engine
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
and strapped an electric motor onto it
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
now in the case of an automobile we
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that right you have
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh Tesla and various other companies
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
have created electric cars they go up
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
and down the roads we get
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
that where this starts to get a little
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
different is what happens when you take
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
a v twin out of a motorcycle and you put
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
an electric motor in
 
03:49:02.189 --> 03:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
that is that is that still a motorcycle
 
03:49:04.590 --> 03:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
because in the early days of the bicycle
 
03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
industry that's exactly what the bicycle
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
industry did is they put one-cylinder
 
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:10.149 align:start position:0%
industry did is they put one-cylinder
Motors

03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
Motors
 
03:49:10.159 --> 03:49:11.070 align:start position:0%
Motors
on

03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
bicycles and even 100 years ago
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
attempted to put electric motors on
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
bicycles so what happens here is that
 
03:49:23.070 --> 03:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
we've we've now come full circle back
 
03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
into this and we find that the law seems
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
to be very absent when it comes to
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
addressing what those vehicles
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
are now in in this particular case
 
03:49:39.550 --> 03:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
my my background is I've been in in
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
public safety for 27
 
03:49:41.399 --> 03:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
public safety for 27
years

03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:42.410 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:49:42.410 --> 03:49:43.830 align:start position:0%
years

[Music]
 
03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.550 align:start position:0%
[Music]
and

03:49:45.550 --> 03:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
we in public safety have had to adjust
 
03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
and modify how we operate based on the
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
technology of the day whether it was the
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
introdu introduction of airbags or the
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
introduction of giant battery packs but
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
in the case of personal electric
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles the concern that that I have
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
here specifically and and why this bill
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
is I co-sponsored this bill has to do
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
with the use of these items on
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and rail trails and other ways
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
where folks were pedestrians and these
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.149 --> 03:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
together what you end up with and what
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see happen is the rail
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
Trails basically turn into racetracks
 
03:50:43.550 --> 03:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
now the town of Derry is fortunate that
 
03:50:46.110 --> 03:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
it has two entire sets of railroad beds
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
that bisect each other technically in
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
Windom one of which is paved and one of
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
not and we have already experienced
 
03:50:58.229 --> 03:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
situations of electric vehicles
 
03:51:01.149 --> 03:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
traveling down the paved rail
 
03:51:01.159 --> 03:51:03.229 align:start position:0%
traveling down the paved rail
trail

03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
trail
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the important part of this
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislation specifically for my
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance ances and with my
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
constituency is we need to establish
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
some ground rules and some boundaries as
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
to how these pevs are going to are going
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
to work with our with our pedestrian
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
community so if you'll notice in the
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill we love lines and pages so like
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
page two has an example at the top lines
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
3 through six covers sidewalks walking
 
03:51:40.189 --> 03:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
trails rail trails that that sort of
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.990 --> 03:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
that the paragraph below that b if you
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
look at that seems to mimic the bicycle
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have in the
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
state because again these personal
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles kind of skate a line
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
between being an electric motorcycle and
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
being an electric bicycle
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
so this in no way and and I want to make
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
that clear in no way creates a helmet
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
law for an electric motorcycle we're not
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
even going to touch
 
03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
that but what this does do for those
 
03:52:18.030 --> 03:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
that are 16 or
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
under puts these into this into the
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
bicycles you'll see some classification
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
changes some definitions that need to
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
happen uh because as as you know when we
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
come up with terms in law that we don't
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
Define Things become
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:39.830 align:start position:0%
Define Things become
problematic

03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the gist of of my
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
concern with what's going on right now
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
the concern I have in Dairy for these U
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
personal electric
 
03:52:50.920 --> 03:52:52.429 align:start position:0%
personal electric
vehicles

03:52:52.429 --> 03:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
and the desire for the state to get
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
ahead of something for a change and not
 
03:53:00.269 --> 03:53:00.279 align:start position:0%
for us to uh have to react after we
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
start dealing with the uh inevitable
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
devices

03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
devices
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes I think
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hill was first rock paper
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
scissors I get to say representative
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
sex thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative Hill uh representative
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
Pearson um you only have one more year
 
03:53:34.110 --> 03:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
to match my 28 years in public safety so
 
03:53:37.710 --> 03:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
God willing I make it you will um my
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
question is that um as a community that
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
has several miles of paved rail trail
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing a proliferation of
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
pevs one of the biggest concerns that I
 
03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
see and I wonder your opinion my
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
question is what your opinion might be
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
um about how it's yes they go probably
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
too fast but more importantly if you're
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
walking this way and they come up behind
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
you you just don't have any idea that
 
03:54:13.319 --> 03:54:14.110 align:start position:0%
you you just don't have any idea that
they're

03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:54:17.269 --> 03:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
coming have you given any thought to
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
some type of where there's that
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
close um interaction between pedestrians
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
and these pevs to some kind of warning
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
system that would allow pedestrians to
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
know that these pevs are
 
03:54:36.269 --> 03:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
coming the the dairy rail
 
03:54:36.279 --> 03:54:37.870 align:start position:0%
coming the the dairy rail
trail

03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
trail
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
has rules I guess we could call them
 
03:54:41.120 --> 03:54:42.510 align:start position:0%
has rules I guess we could call them
common

03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
common
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
courtesies um for bicycles when they
 
03:54:47.550 --> 03:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
come upon pedestrians um either through
 
03:54:47.560 --> 03:54:48.269 align:start position:0%
come upon pedestrians um either through
a

03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
verbal notification or you laugh but the
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
old 1950s Bell we they do it it it works
 
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
and um again with the with the rail
 
03:55:02.670 --> 03:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
trails in my community being open to
 
03:55:06.630 --> 03:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
pedestrians and horses horses and
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
bicyclists if that would just fall fall
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
into the existing rules that we have now
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
courtesy go ahead follow up yeah it's
 
03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
but but is the these rules how are they
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
established are they just der's rules or
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
are they Statewide possibility Mr toam
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
who was eloquently introduced by
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul who is a a friend
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly a recognized expert in
 
03:55:38.830 --> 03:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
this field can address the the larger
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide way that they they look at
 
03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
things but I can only speak to how we
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
function at Dairy thank
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Hill thank you Mr
 
03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:55:56.149 --> 03:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
um who's going to enforce these uh are
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
you anticipating having uh Rail Trail
 
03:56:02.429 --> 03:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
Police or is this local police or is
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
this who who's going to determine
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
someone is going 15 miles per hour um
 
03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
when they have a perhaps a class three
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
bicycle that goes 28 miles an hour so in
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy right now we do have
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
bicycle patrols on our rail trail right
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
now that that will
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
enforce uh ordinance within the town now
 
03:56:29.790 --> 03:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
they're not year round certainly um I'm
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
not really concerned about pevs this
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
time of year they're really not going to
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
make it down the snow but um but that as
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
the public way as it sits and I don't
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
Envision that changing at all they'll
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
continue to do
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
that further
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions I I've got one well actually
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair so on page
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
two of uh line 13 where it says um
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
operation of a peev over the speed limit
 
03:57:02.960 --> 03:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
operation of a peev over the speed limit
it's

03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:57:04.239 --> 03:57:06.189 align:start position:0%
it's
violation

03:57:06.189 --> 03:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
violation
 
03:57:08.149 --> 03:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
um how you going to collect this
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
violation from a 13year
 
03:57:10.439 --> 03:57:15.070 align:start position:0%
violation from a 13year
old

03:57:15.070 --> 03:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.710 --> 03:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question I'm not
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how they collect how they
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
enforce the law on
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
minors in all other facets right now um
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
but would they do it so I'm not that's
 
03:57:30.910 --> 03:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
not my uh area of of Knowledge from a
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint other
 
03:57:39.389 --> 03:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
questions I've got one uh first page 911
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
is it the
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill to classify these
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
things these electric bicycles as
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
motorcycles because it does appear
 
03:57:55.269 --> 03:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
category I do I do see there's a 5 m
 
03:58:00.510 --> 03:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
hour caveat there but yeah or five
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.429 --> 03:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
sure right so um no I I see this this is
 
03:58:14.229 --> 03:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
where the reality and the slang
 
03:58:15.870 --> 03:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
terminology collide with each other
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
because a motor by definition is all
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
Motors are electric and engines are
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
internal combustion and that's where we
 
03:58:27.149 --> 03:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
got to be careful here when we use the
 
03:58:30.429 --> 03:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
term motor to not really mean motor and
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
in this case motor literally means motor
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
as an electric
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
motor so I think that with your with the
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
five you're exceeding the five
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
horsepower rating that really puts that
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
into a narrow field as an electric item
 
03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
and not a not classifying these as
 
03:58:47.550 --> 03:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
motorcycles at
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
all I'll look into that a little more
 
03:58:51.790 --> 03:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
but I guess they did mislabel them 130
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
years ago or so but you are correct um
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing while I've got
 
03:58:59.710 --> 03:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
you and I just have not gone through all
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
the related statutes on this bill yet do
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
we currently have uh helmet laws and
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
reflector reflective outer wear
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
for under 16 16 and under on bicycles
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
currently yeah we do absolutely Y no
 
03:59:18.750 --> 03:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately hardly ever enforced
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
another no fund Bill okay but yeah it's
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
um that is that is very much a a
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
requirement in the state of New
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay well representative Hill
 
03:59:30.670 --> 03:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
got my other one so any other questions
 
03:59:32.229 --> 03:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:59:35.229 --> 03:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
sellers yeah thank you again um I did
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
see here 750 watts would it did that
 
03:59:41.229 --> 03:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
come from is that a national standard or
 
03:59:41.239 --> 03:59:42.670 align:start position:0%
come from is that a national standard or
something

03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:59:46.149 --> 03:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
or I have absolutely no idea where that
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
comes from um whatsoever I didn't write
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm I support
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
it and I don't know if Mr toppen can
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
answer that but uh I'm not the guy to
 
03:59:58.590 --> 03:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
one it sounds like the bicycle
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
specialist will be good on that one um
 
04:00:05.710 --> 04:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
did you have one related to him or one
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the other speakers U 700 50 746 is
 
04:00:12.910 --> 04:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
the electrical equivalent of one
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
horsepower okay uh with no other
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%

scenes folks all those here in the state

house including office of legislative
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
Services I know put a lot of time and
 
04:01:50.670 --> 04:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
work drafting this bill and I don't
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
figure it's in final format today but if
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
I can explain a few things for the
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
intent the merits where we're trying to
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
go with it I think we have something to
 
04:02:00.990 --> 04:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
talk about for another day in a work
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
session or even offline
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
meetings I just say briefly also adding
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
up for what uh representative gold to
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
say yes I've been involved in the
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
cycling world since
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
1971 I'm a nationally certified cycling
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
instructor on road cycling not racing
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
not mountain biking but yes I have those
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
backgrounds there and again actually
 
04:02:26.189 --> 04:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
working with do everything bike ped
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
related in do for 44 years I don't think
 
04:02:31.030 --> 04:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a single project in do I
 
04:02:35.149 --> 04:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
haven't seen or contributed to so again
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
I've been around a while and kind of
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
have the gray hair to prove it if you
 
04:02:37.800 --> 04:02:38.950 align:start position:0%
have the gray hair to prove it if you
would

04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
so hand in hand with that I'll just say
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
that the input of the hand up we have
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
going around here at the
 
04:02:48.189 --> 04:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
moment basically was a result to me
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
being aware of some issues here in the
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
state going back two years ago when I
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
start to see machines being sold as if
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
they were
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
ebikes ebikes Again by classification if
 
04:03:04.149 --> 04:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
you do flip through that brochure
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a I'm not going to go through
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
Page by page but you can glance at some
 
04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
of it ebikes themselves classified here
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire will be class one two
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
or three again the quick definition
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
class one means simply pedal assist the
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
motor will help you go up to 20 mil an
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
hour that's it class two simply means
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
you can push a button a throttle button
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
and it will power the bicycle with no
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
pedaling up to 20 mil an hour class
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
three and that definition of the one
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
horsepower rating by the way that came
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
about 2003 from the US consumer product
 
04:03:46.590 --> 04:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
safety commission they are the ones who
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
defined these bicycles they're call
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
lowspeed electric
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
bicycles be no more than one
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
horsepower 750 watt to uh 746 to be
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
exact they round it off to
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
750 and would not have a powered speed
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
of more than 20 miles an hour even a
 
04:04:09.750 --> 04:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
class three bike if it had a throttle on
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
it the older ones did newer ones
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
basically don't the throttle alone motor
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
power only will not power that bicycle
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
more than 20 miles an hour so I think
 
04:04:22.269 --> 04:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
that's a key point to reference along
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
the way that that's where this one
 
04:04:29.229 --> 04:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
horsepower 20 M hour speed rating came
 
04:04:32.149 --> 04:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
from going on from there and more few
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
more recent years bicycle industry and
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
people for bikes naal organization
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
looked at this
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
and said it's kind of a vague definition
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
how do we tell one from another so they
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
implemented this classification that was
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
end through the bicycle industry and
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
people for bikes not cpsc so that's
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
where it all came from in 2018 I worked
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the bill House Bill 148 which was
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
fully enacted in
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
2019 that made ebikes quote legal in New
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the class one two three
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
specifications that we're talking about
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
now couple pages in on the handout you
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
see all the green states that have
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
adopted that exact protocol defining
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
what an eite
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
is so fast forward a little
 
04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
bit approximately two years ago I
 
04:05:23.950 --> 04:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
started seeing machines showing up on
 
04:05:25.710 --> 04:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
rail Trails I live in Salem we've got
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
two miles paved and it connects all the
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
way through Windam into Dairy I started
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
seeing uh so-called bikes ebikes and
 
04:05:35.309 --> 04:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
people complaining left and right these
 
04:05:38.510 --> 04:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
things are going way too fast we have
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
the problem of Trail etiquette common
 
04:05:43.030 --> 04:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
sense and courtesy with regular of
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
bicyclist I as a bicyclist my normal
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
cruising speed on a road would probably
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
be 16 miles an hour on a smooth paved
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
rail trail a slight downhill I could
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
easily do 2025 on my bicycle with no
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
electric assist I mean that's just a
 
04:06:00.389 --> 04:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
back of life that's efficiency bicycles
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
are most efficient form of
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
transportation in the world of calories
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
burned and all those are good factors so
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
we started seeing these uh device is
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
showing up I take a look at it because
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
most people can't tell one bike from
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
another class one two three when I see
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
this machine that has this huge battery
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
on it and a humongous motor I said
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a class one two three I'm
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
calling them an electric motorcycle with
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
pedals with no regulation no licensing
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
no safety training nothing okay it's
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
just out there and they're being sold
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
and used in the state and online as if
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
they were ebikes really they're giv the
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
ebike users bad reputation they're going
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
too fast they're going down the trail 40
 
04:06:48.030 --> 04:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
m an hour not on a Class one two or
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
three you're not those folks doing like
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
15 average so when we get to where we
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
are now it came to and I like to just
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
Enlighten you folks a little bit today
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with some of this
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
terminology that's why I call this
 
04:07:04.149 --> 04:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
little handout definitions devices
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
whatever a term that's been B around
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
quite recently the micro Mobility we're
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
talking little scooters skateboards
 
04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
whatever you know electric assist
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
battery power lithium batteries are
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
showing up everywhere the cheap ones
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
burn up we know there's lots of stories
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
about New York going up in flames in
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
some areas but it still comes down the
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
fact they're out there the intent of
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
this spill is not to hone in
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
particularly on these lowend devices
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're kind of like
 
04:07:34.590 --> 04:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
toys okay they're out there the kids
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
might do 15 miles an hour on might do 10
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
they fall into it but that goes into
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
person electric vehicle with a light
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
category it's really the low end of the
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
spectrum ones that concern us are the
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
higher end highspeed machines which have
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
the horsepower and speed equivalent to
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
what we currently regulate here in New
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as Motor
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicles you know if you go over that
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
little one horsepower Mark 20 mes hour
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
for an ebike and and then you start
 
04:08:11.550 --> 04:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
talking about how these machines are out
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
there with no regulation yes they can go
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
from Z to 40 miles an hour in 4
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
seconds these other units as one I I
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
just saw a video the other day this guy
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
on this uh I call it elect motorcycle
 
04:08:29.790 --> 04:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
with pedals was clocked at 101 miles an
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
hour unicycles that was a new thing two
 
04:08:34.990 --> 04:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
years ago I saw these showing up as
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
these high-end bicycles SL F the
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and pedals but more recently
 
04:08:43.389 --> 04:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
I was made aware of electric
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
unicycles I give the users a lot of
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
credit they have more balance and
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
Agility than I would ever think of
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
having I have enough to do to Pedal a
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
bicycle honestly especially at my age
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
but it comes down the fact that these
 
04:08:56.830 --> 04:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
machines if you haven't seen them they
 
04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
are amazing piece of technology it's one
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
wheel I'm not talking about ball I'm
 
04:09:03.870 --> 04:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
talking wheel so you sit on it or you
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
stand on it they call them pedals
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
they're really platforms and they're
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
kind of defined in here in a couple
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
places that basically they lean forward
 
04:09:15.149 --> 04:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
you go fast you lean back you slow down
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
and they have the gyroscopic mechanism
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
to control it not side to side that's
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
what the operator does those devices are
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
show you up again with no regulation we
 
04:09:26.910 --> 04:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
have videos that were recorded both here
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire on the carton Valley
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
rail trail and over in Vermont eastn
 
04:09:34.830 --> 04:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
rail Eastern Trail people doing and
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
proud of doing 30 40 miles an hour on on
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
the rail Trails on these electric
 
04:09:43.229 --> 04:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
unicycles again no regulation they're
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact hey this is fun we
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
have all these open rail trails in New
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's come on over from the
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
main the club let's go out here and
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
Blast Away 40 mes hour in rail Trails we
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
worried about 20 M hour bike no wa I why
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
I want to tie you up all day but let
 
04:10:00.750 --> 04:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
just close it out a little bit here the
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is that I if we can
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh get the message across that we feel
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
that these machines are actually more
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
like Motor Vehicles certainly not ebikes
 
04:10:15.109 --> 04:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
or bicycles and we have machines out
 
04:10:17.229 --> 04:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
here today from moped scooters motor
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
driven Cycles true motorcycles they all
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
fall into that category of speed range
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
horow for level of Regulation and safety
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
how you right now today you can get a
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
kid 12 years old can jump on this quote
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
electric motorcycle hit the button and
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
be thrown off and get killed or ser
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
iously hurt as Simon Cowell did on his
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
bike a few years ago because he didn't
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
know what he was doing he broke his back
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
he said maybe I should have read the
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
manual verse maybe we should have taken
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
a safety course yeah so anyway there a
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
lot of things that go into this along
 
04:10:51.159 --> 04:10:51.830 align:start position:0%
lot of things that go into this along
the

04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
way if we uh if we don't regulate them
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
and have the control they're going to sh
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
up more and more
 
04:11:01.710 --> 04:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
numbers uh ebikes and these unicycles
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
electric unicycles are being sold in
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
more numbers right now in this country
 
04:11:08.429 --> 04:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
than electric vehicles s and trucks put
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
together they are showing up left and
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
right so the question is here can we do
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
something about it can we control it can
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
we regulate it safety not just for the
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
public I'm talking about not rail Trails
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
exclusive I'm talking about on the road
 
04:11:25.630 --> 04:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
in Salem I see some of these people
 
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
going down the middle Road 28 45 miles
 
04:11:27.760 --> 04:11:28.750 align:start position:0%
going down the middle Road 28 45 miles
an

04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
hour Poli looks at it and says they tell
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
me it's an ebike because it has pedals
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
on it really yeah no so again we're
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
asking that uh we look at this as what
 
04:11:43.109 --> 04:11:43.119 align:start position:0%
they are I'm calling to actually be uh
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycles first electric motorcycles
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
so to speak and then pick it up from
 
04:11:50.670 --> 04:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
there I would definitely welcome
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
questions a work session and even with
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
folks in the DMV or do some offline
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
meetings which we've already talked
 
04:11:58.269 --> 04:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
about thank you
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
rich thank you very much I just have a a
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
general question I have an electric
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
wheelchair where does that fall into
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
this category it doesn't ride on the
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalks why on the edge of the road so
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like mop head would fall in
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah through the Ada standards and
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
everything Mobility devices for those
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
who are disabled or need to get around
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
they are automatically allowed to use
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
these everywhere okay I was just
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
wondering yeah they they're definitely
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
covered our already okay yeah thank you
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
question am I reading this correctly
 
04:12:54.510 --> 04:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
that um no matter what class you have um
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
or even
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the big battery one that you
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned um if this is to pass no one
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to drive one of those on
 
04:13:09.389 --> 04:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
any uh sidewalk side uh walkway or
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
public way or public places more than 15
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
miles an hour the 15 miles an hour I
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
would not want to push that one because
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
again most of the time rail Trails
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
especially a build at like 20 miles an
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
hour normal traffic flow and again the
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
bikes limited to 20 elville 148 defined
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
again 20 mph ebikes on Rails okay 28 if
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're pedaling like crazy least 289 so
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
I would say suggest we get into a work
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
session Define breakout this bill a bit
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
more I'd probably suggest that that be
 
04:13:45.070 --> 04:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
20 in the bill not
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
15 and that would apply to all vehicles
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
the main cavity art being you know for a
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
fact here and I think throughout the
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
country and I only just he on rail
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
Trails I'm talking about Road use of
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
these devices too but just talking rail
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
Trails again the uh idea that motor
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles are not allowed on rail trails
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
that are federally funded okay
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
so mobiles yes bicycles pedestrians yes
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles no so if we started
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
getting into these highspeed high power
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
pevs whether they're unicycles or least
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
for electric motorcycles with pedals if
 
04:14:26.670 --> 04:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
they're classified as motorc as motor
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles that automatically be excluded
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
from the likes of rail Trails they're
 
04:14:33.790 --> 04:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
feder Qui follow
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you um so would it make sense
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
then for there to be an additional class
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
Beyond these um and I'm and I'm thinking
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
more for the higher end
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
um units that you're talking about
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
because it would seem to me
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
um there's no licenses for those so if
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
someone is under a DUI for instance and
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
can't use their their driver's license
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
and they can use
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
something else that goes at 45 mil hour
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
without um a license it why would we cut
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
it off at 28 I guess that's my question
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
cut it off at what 28 miles an hour
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's what this is class three is
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
cutting it off at CL class three ebike
 
04:15:27.109 --> 04:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
at 28
 
04:15:29.670 --> 04:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
correct let also gets some I think
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're getting to the point also of uh
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
diversity and Equity had a little
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
conversation way those are orally
 
04:15:36.600 --> 04:15:37.790 align:start position:0%
conversation way those are orally
proposed

04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be uh one set and
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
regulations pricing for everyone those
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
who need a bicycle on ebike to get
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
around like a cargo bike it'll probably
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
have usually 1,500 watt motor on it but
 
04:15:55.469 --> 04:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
still under two horsepower or so there
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be that level of category of
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
basically it's over this under that
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
technically the industry calls them oevs
 
04:16:04.109 --> 04:16:04.119 align:start position:0%
outer class electric vehicles so not
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
class one two three but they're not into
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
R the true high-end motor vehicle type
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
class like a motorcycle would be okay so
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
you can't had this interim range and if
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
we work this out
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
properly they would still have some
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
training you still don't want people out
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
using those willy-nilly
 
04:16:24.429 --> 04:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
causing problems on the road themselves
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
and everyone else around them but if we
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
had that then still regulated to a point
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
someone as a moped it was like $8 a year
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
for a license or registration for a
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
moped in most times at least there' be
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
some safeguards on AR people know what
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
04:16:42.109 --> 04:16:42.119 align:start position:0%
into versus going out there and doing
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
whatever see like a kid getting on one
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
of these things and heading a throttle
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
and heading in trouble that's not a good
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
you thank very much okay thank you for
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.710 --> 04:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh next up last uh
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
person signed up director morasco from
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor
 
04:17:18.109 --> 04:17:18.119 align:start position:0%
Vehicles um not supporting or opposing
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
currently thank you Mr chairman members
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'll be brief um I just
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh give some context to the
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
fact that the DMV does receive uh quite
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
a few calls uh regarding these issues
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
where people have questions about the
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
safety of the Rider and the safety of
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
the uh the public because of the speeds
 
04:17:42.030 --> 04:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
and the types of vehicles that are out
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
there today that are motorized um as the
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative spoke about with uh um
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know unicycles and skateboards and
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
of course the scooters um I also want to
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that within the last
 
04:17:56.189 --> 04:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
couple of months I had an opportunity to
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
attend an American Association of Motor
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
Vehicle administrators conference uh
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
with motor vehicle directors from
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
Washington DC all the way up uh to parts
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
of Canada and um this is a national
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
issue um many states are trying to
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to regulate these
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and and many states are
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
worried about the safety concerns that
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
go along with that um there's also an
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
Amba survey that went out on this uh
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
some time ago I looked at that and um in
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
Most states um these vehicles are dealt
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
with at the town and City level um
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
through a local ordinance um but that
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
being said that you know regulating it
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
at the state level and having something
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's uniform um does does make sense
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
so I certainly uh the intent of the bill
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
I I fully understand um as far as from a
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
DMV standpoint uh the bill does ask the
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
DMV to create an online um personal
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle safety course um the
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
only concern I would have with that is
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh we filed a fiscal note there would be
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
um we'd have to hire a full-time uh
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
training coordinator to um build the
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
content for that and to manage it and I
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how many attendees we would
 
04:19:05.790 --> 04:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
have in something like that because the
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill it looked like if you're 16 or
 
04:19:10.349 --> 04:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
older and you don't have a valid license
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take the course but
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
there's also a section of the bill that
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
talks about if you're under 16 and have
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
to wear the helmet and the uh protective
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
gear um I would assume that person would
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
have to go through the course as well so
 
04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know what those numbers would
 
04:19:26.109 --> 04:19:26.119 align:start position:0%
look like um we are hopefully due to get
 
04:19:27.790 --> 04:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
a Moodle training server which is an
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
online training uh platform that we had
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
at one time we're hoping to get that as
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
soon as next month but that's $225,000 a
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
year to um to maintain that and then um
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to promote that online
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
training through that the other concern
 
04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
I would have with the uh with the safety
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
course is building content not so sure
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
where I would find the experts on um
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
electric unicycles uh or skateboards per
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
se I mean we run a motorcycle rider
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
training course um that we run about
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
2,000 people through a year uh we
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
provide the motorcycles and they learn
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
to ride over the two-day course um but
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
some of these uh are outside the box um
 
04:20:07.149 --> 04:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
Vehicles if you will so we just have to
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
do some research into how we would
 
04:20:10.630 --> 04:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
educate people on how to properly ride
 
04:20:10.640 --> 04:20:12.429 align:start position:0%
educate people on how to properly ride
them

04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
um and then of course we'd have to issue
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh new registration plates um for these
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles depending on whether
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
or not they they receive a registration
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
but those are the uh the main highlights
 
04:20:25.990 --> 04:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to offer to you and uh
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative sellers thank
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you how do how do you register
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
of even one of these devices a pev to a
 
04:20:45.070 --> 04:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
13-year-old yeah that's that's a great
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
question representative that I mean I I
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
look at it when these first uh when I
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
first came into this position and these
 
04:20:52.349 --> 04:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles were coming to my
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
attention you look at what we do for a
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
moped it's pretty basic and simple if it
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
goes more than 30 miles an hour you have
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
to have a driver's license you have to
 
04:21:03.229 --> 04:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
register the vehicle um I'm not sure how
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
you register um an e skateboard I don't
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to interject with a
 
04:21:11.229 --> 04:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
question because it may help some of the
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
other ones I shared a commission a few
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
years ago the commission to study the
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
use Road use of non-traditional motor
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles and at the time uh we did bring
 
04:21:24.990 --> 04:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
up the conversation of some of the
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
things that are covered in this bill
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
um electric scooters unicycles
 
04:21:32.830 --> 04:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
skateboards electric hoverboards goed
 
04:21:35.070 --> 04:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
Segways one wheels and electric skates
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
at the time we were told the Federal
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
government uh was in the process of
 
04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
defining definitions or creating
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
definitions to make those personal
 
04:21:44.040 --> 04:21:45.189 align:start position:0%
definitions to make those personal
Mobility

04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
Mobility
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
devices have you heard anything more
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
from the FED government on that because
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this bill is trying
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
to turn these into Motor Vehicles which
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from using the trails
 
04:21:58.510 --> 04:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
where the last I knew the federal
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
government is trying to call them
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
personal ability devices that's a great
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
question representative I I don't have
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
um any information on that but I
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
supervisor of registrations Kathy
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
diamond is here and maybe I could just
 
04:22:12.429 --> 04:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
ask Kathy do you heard anything on good
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
morning no we have not heard any update
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
on that okay thank you thank
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking my question uh
 
04:22:26.670 --> 04:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
the question I have is does it look to
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
you like this bill is essentially trying
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
to cover everything that has one or more
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
wheels and it's designed to carry one or
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
more p people up to including
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
automobiles yeah when I first read the
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill I mean it captures um all of the
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles um or electric devices
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing about out there I
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
think it tries to put them all under one
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
umbrella and try to regulate them and I
 
04:22:54.510 --> 04:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
I know it's being done through the
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
lenses of safety um which you know we
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate and support um could there be
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
I know the representative mentioned a
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
working group could there be a way to
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
maybe drill down a little bit more and
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
figure out how we could bifurcate some
 
04:23:08.910 --> 04:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
of these things find out what other
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
states are doing um in certain areas uh
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
even at the the local level what they're
 
04:23:16.590 --> 04:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
doing with a with a e skateboard um you
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
know I think we're we're certainly open
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
to working with uh the sponsor and
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else on getting it exactly the
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
way that everybody wants it thank
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
you uh hold on representative
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman director
 
04:23:34.990 --> 04:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
marasco could I call your attention to
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
oops and it just flipped away on me hold
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
line three I'm just trying to get some
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.800 --> 04:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
so it if what I I what I think what I'm
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
interpreting about this and I'm asking
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
for you to for clarity about this my
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
question is can you clarify this for me
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
says on public ways or public places
 
04:24:14.349 --> 04:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
besides those in the in
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
a the speed limit should be based on the
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
speed limits in this section no person
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
younger than 16 May operate a peev on
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
any public property no that's not the
 
04:24:26.910 --> 04:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
one I want I'm sorry it's yeah line
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
three no person shall operate a peev
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
over five miles per hour on sidewalks
 
04:24:33.870 --> 04:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
walkways and walking
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
trails which the purposes of this
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph is dreamed primery reasonable
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
and prudent speed for peev travel no
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
person shall operate a peev over 15
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
miles per hour on public rail Trails
 
04:24:48.990 --> 04:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
Public hiking trails and public Trails
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
but it does not say public WS so my
 
04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
presumption is
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
that my question is do we have
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
regulations for these types devices that
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
would regulate them operating on public
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
ways which is a more you know a more
 
04:25:10.510 --> 04:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
technical I guess less technical word
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
but a more technical
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
travel I would say for um the types of
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are that are outlined here
 
04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
non-traditional um I don't know that we
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
that so at this point you would
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
interpret this to mean that
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
these types of vehicles could operate on
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
public ways because that's that's the
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
part I'm struggling with I want to see
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
where it says they can't if that's the
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
anybody yeah I'm sorry with the uh with
 
04:26:03.109 --> 04:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
our new technology I need you to come up
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the microphone we don't want the
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
people on YouTube to miss
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
beat apologize so again Kathleen Diamond
 
04:26:11.950 --> 04:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so from my understanding
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
that does not grant them to be able to
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
be on their public ways however I know
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
there was another bill that we were
 
04:26:19.149 --> 04:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
working with um with another
 
04:26:22.109 --> 04:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
representative trer to Define exactly
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
what these type of vehicles are and what
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to do and how we're going to
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
register them if we register them at
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
all yeah just for the committee too
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
there are two bills that deal with these
 
04:26:34.750 --> 04:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
this one was deemed an early bill that's
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
why we're hearing it today I would have
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
liked to have heard them both but I
 
04:26:40.149 --> 04:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough time to do them both
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
so there is another one so look at uh
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
well you'll find it we've only got 29
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
but you can start looking at the two of
 
04:26:49.630 --> 04:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
them side by side that might be helpful
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:26:54.269 --> 04:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you director for taking
 
04:26:57.870 --> 04:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
my question I I'm as in a previous
 
04:26:59.950 --> 04:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm more concerned with um
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
those that are uh dropping down to the
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
use of these electric um motorcycles to
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh rather than um when they've lost
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
their license under DUI or some other
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
condition um there's nothing in this
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill that addresses that is there
 
04:27:21.149 --> 04:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
anything in the works from from your
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
department to um
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
to help with that safety issue I guess
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I have heard
 
04:27:29.040 --> 04:27:30.710 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I have heard
that

04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe representative
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
trier's Bill the last time I looked at
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
it I don't think there's I don't believe
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's anything in there that addresses
 
04:27:41.469 --> 04:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
I I do I apologize most recent version
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes it was a recent version that we were
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to work on the fines and for DWIs
 
04:27:45.800 --> 04:27:47.309 align:start position:0%
going to work on the fines and for DWIs
and

04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
such but but prohibiting prohibiting
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
those that have already been convicted
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
correct from driving correct okay after
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
suspension I yeah
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay so will will that be coming in the
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
next bill that we see or is this a bill
 
04:28:03.239 --> 04:28:04.830 align:start position:0%
next bill that we see or is this a bill
that's

04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated is that the bill you're
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
referring to is that representative
 
04:28:10.349 --> 04:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
triers yeah we do have in possession
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative triers so we'll look at
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
that one look at them both side by side
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and again why one was early and one
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't if I had a little more time in
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the day if I had known the morning was
 
04:28:23.109 --> 04:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to go so smoothly uh I would have
 
04:28:25.389 --> 04:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
snuck it in this morning but nonetheless
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
we have one more peev Bill coming after
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
this one any other questions from the
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative St
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you real real quick question
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
here I I'm very ignor of this type of uh
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle I understand that if you have a
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
one of these that goes 28 miles an hour
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh with modification it can go up to 42
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
miles an hour that being said would you
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
give any thought to uh Banning the
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
ownership or use of these to anybody
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
under 16 years of
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
age I think that's
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
um put it this way uh I I look out my
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
window in the office uh some days and I
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
see a young person go by on an e
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
skateboard at at a high rate of speed
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
with no helmet on I think to myself if
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
that young man ends up hitting a pebble
 
04:29:16.990 --> 04:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
he's going to go overhead first and uh
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a good day so um I
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
think that's probably part of what this
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to identify and fix is
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that I think um as the previous
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
um individual testified about the fact
 
04:29:31.510 --> 04:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking something um and it's out
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the box you really don't know uh your
 
04:29:35.550 --> 04:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
limitations you don't know what it can
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
do do and um yeah the speed is too fast
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
for young people that haven't had the
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be properly trained and
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
even if they were it's still too fast so
 
04:29:48.269 --> 04:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
to your point um it's probably not safe
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody uh at that speed on a on a
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
skateboard or unicycle um and especially
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that's young that doesn't have
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
any type of training behind them thank
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
you what
 
04:30:05.109 --> 04:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
else seeing then thank you very much
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.590 --> 04:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close the public hearing
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
I have nobody else signed up to speak
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on
 
04:30:18.269 --> 04:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
1543 uh give us a few minutes to regroup
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
last hearing of the day we'll do
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.640 --> 04:38:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
 
04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1391
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
FN allowing new vehicle purchases in the
 
04:38:37.869 --> 04:38:37.879 align:start position:0%
model year or before to be inspected in
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
the second year after purchase Chay
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
 
04:38:41.359 --> 04:38:42.949 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
representative

04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
Koker thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee it's kind
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
of weird being on this side of the uh
 
04:38:48.439 --> 04:38:49.709 align:start position:0%
of weird being on this side of the uh
the

04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
tables um we're pretty intimidating
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
aren't we a little bit yeah I'm a little
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
scared um anyway so uh House Bill
 
04:39:00.910 --> 04:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
1391 to me is a very common sense change
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we can make to our vehicle
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
inspection regulations um the simplest
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
way to explain it say today I was born
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
in March I go to a dealership and I buy
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
a car um it's 2024 the next time I need
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
it inspected would be in
 
04:39:20.349 --> 04:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
2026 um so the reason how this Genesis
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
of how this bill came out you know came
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
about at least for me is um on my Town's
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
Community Facebook page I go out there
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I solicit ideas a lot and that can
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
be a double-edged sword and um this guy
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
who normally hates everything that I do
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
um put up an idea and he said why in the
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
world do I have to get my brand new car
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
inspected um every year and I said I
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that's a good good question
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
so got me looking into it and um once I
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
started digging into the data a little
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
bit I agreed with them so um what I
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
think is really important about this is
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
right now in the times that we're in I
 
04:40:01.230 --> 04:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
mean the political polarization is
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um people frankly don't
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
really trust the government
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
and when we compel them to do something
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have a very valid
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
reason to do it and you know on the face
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
of it a vehicle inspection doesn't seem
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
like it's a big imposition it's not a
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
big deal but if you look at the fiscal
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
note this bill would reduce the amount
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
of inspections by about $83,000 or
 
04:40:32.948 --> 04:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
83,000 inspections per year um so say
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
you break that down and it takes
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
somebody an hour to go get that
 
04:40:38.430 --> 04:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
inspection and that's optimistic when
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
you consider travel time all the factors
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
that go into that that's
 
04:40:45.628 --> 04:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
3,458 Days of our constituents time and
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
if you break that down even further that
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
breaks down to literally 10 years of the
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
state's Collective time that they be
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
they could be using to go to work they
 
04:40:56.190 --> 04:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
could be using to do whatever the heck
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
they want to do other than go get their
 
04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspected and the cost of that
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we're asking them to pay is about
 
04:41:04.708 --> 04:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
4.1 million a year um that they could
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
spend on other things that they see fit
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
so uh biggest argument about this is
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
safety everybody's going to say but
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
safety you know we we we have to keep
 
04:41:15.070 --> 04:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
roads safe and obviously I want safe
 
04:41:18.190 --> 04:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
roads my kids live here I'm here I I I
 
04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
want to be safe um so digging around I
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
found this beautiful document and um
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's from the government accountability
 
04:41:28.990 --> 04:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
office um GAO 1575 it was published in
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
2015 um and I was trying to find a
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
little bit more recent stuff but the
 
04:41:33.910 --> 04:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
funny part about this is when you
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually dig into this report the report
 
04:41:39.788 --> 04:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
basically says that listen we've
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
researched this we've looked at some of
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
the studies that were done prior and we
 
04:41:45.390 --> 04:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that vehicle inspections are
 
04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually even a big enough priority to
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
spend more resources and looking into so
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
that was kind of interesting um and a
 
04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
highlight from this is basically this is
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
a study on all cars so this isn't even
 
04:41:58.990 --> 04:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
brand new cars this is all cars as a
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
total um the overwhelming majority of
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
the studies um basically said there's
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
not a statistic Ally significant
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
difference in Crash rates in states with
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
inspection programs compared to those
 
04:42:10.240 --> 04:42:11.788 align:start position:0%
inspection programs compared to those
without

04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
um and you know again this is you're
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lot you know I hear all
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
these antidotal stories about I saw a
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
car with this I saw a car that but just
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
the data at least the data that I seen
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
has not played that out um so we are in
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
the minority of states that actually
 
04:42:32.830 --> 04:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
even require vehicle inspections so um
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
you know Most states don't require it
 
04:42:36.190 --> 04:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
and and living you know I moved here
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
from Florida about 10 years ago and I
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
was actually kind of shocked that in the
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
Live Free or died State I even had to
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
get a vehicle inspection um so a lot of
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
people will say it's our environment
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
well if you look at states with similar
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
winter environments they've repealed
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
their inspection programs and that's
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
Colorado Wyoming Idaho and Nebraska um
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
and what I think is really kind of
 
04:42:59.550 --> 04:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
interesting is there was a study done in
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
Norway that was looking at um basically
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
inspections and and took some Insurance
 
04:43:07.470 --> 04:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
data and it actually found a small
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
incremental increase in crashes with
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections which is kind of
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
funny and I know that vehicle
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
inspections don't cause crashes
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
obviously but it just goes to show you
 
04:43:18.070 --> 04:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
that this the statistics are so close
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
that just it doesn't really play out um
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
and all those you know Norway the
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
winters I've been there it's cold um the
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
winters are are are pretty brutal too so
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
um lastly um so in in my line of work we
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the chain of events that lead
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
to accidents and we call it the Swiss
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
Cheese model so normally if there's an
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
accident there's a million there's a lot
 
04:43:43.628 --> 04:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
of little factors that go on and it's
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
like little pieces of Swiss cheese and
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
when an accident happens that means that
 
04:43:48.788 --> 04:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
somebody was able to line up all the
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
holes in the Swiss cheese and it caused
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
a problem um so looking at the data and
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
this is again from the GAO report uh
 
04:43:58.948 --> 04:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
basically only 2% of accidents were
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
primary caused by vehicle components
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
failures so you know we start breaking
 
04:44:06.510 --> 04:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
this down again all these studies are on
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
all cars not just brand new cars so
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
right then and there putting this bill
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
on new cars already kind of adds in that
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
layer of Swiss cheese to kind of help
 
04:44:17.948 --> 04:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
protect this and you know even when
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
there is a component
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
failure 99% of the time that the you
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
know the the the driver is going to be
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
able to deal with that so again you're
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
just starting to really run down the
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
statistics on how effective these are um
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
and lastly I mean you know what is the
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this program okay you know to
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
me the purpose of this program is safety
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
this program was implemented in 1931 at
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
least are the New Hampshire vehicle
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
inspections imagine how simple the
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
inspections were in 1931 I I I would
 
04:44:51.070 --> 04:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
assume you took it your gas station they
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
did it once over check the brakes and
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
boom you're good to go and I know
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles have gotten more complicated
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
and you know but we've added so much
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
into our inspection laws um and it's
 
04:45:03.788 --> 04:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
just really it's it's complicating
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
things and it's making it so that even
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
this small change I think most of us
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
know that deep down new vehicles can go
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
a couple years without being inspected
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
and everything's going to be okay um
 
04:45:21.868 --> 04:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
so that's about all I've got on this you
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
know I'm willing to work with with
 
04:45:26.190 --> 04:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
people I just really want to reduce the
 
04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
burden that we're asking on the New
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and I think this is a
 
04:45:32.830 --> 04:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
very good step to uh take in doing that
 
04:45:35.910 --> 04:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:45:37.390 --> 04:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative sers yeah thank
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
you um regarding inspection stickers I
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
for those that can afford a new car it
 
04:45:52.270 --> 04:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
just seems like if you're
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
um it could
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
be what do I want to say um segregating
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
people and breaking them up into groups
 
04:46:03.550 --> 04:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
because the the the ones that need their
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
cars fixed the most other people that
 
04:46:07.550 --> 04:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
really can't afford to get them fixed
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
yep but we're forcing them to get
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
stickers that that's correct so could we
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
expand on this and like you're saying
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
could we not just just do away
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers so my my goal with
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is let's let's take the safest
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
most like I mean benign step we possibly
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
can forward and let's look at the data
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
because there's just not a lot of data
 
04:46:33.708 --> 04:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
like the report said you know they
 
04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
looked into this and they were you know
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
it was a Senator asking for an opinion
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
and when they responded back the GAO
 
04:46:42.548 --> 04:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
responded back and the you know NH sta
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
they were like listen there's just not a
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
lot of data and it's almost not even
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
worth looking at the data because so few
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
accidents are caused by component
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
failure so I say this is just a very
 
04:46:56.750 --> 04:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
easy step to take common sense and what
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
I I believe our constituents would want
 
04:46:58.958 --> 04:46:59.948 align:start position:0%
I I believe our constituents would want
from

04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
us further questions from the
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee they're letting you off the
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
hook pretty easy oh yeah I know thank
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
much excuse
 
04:47:19.390 --> 04:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
me uh next up which I recogniz is car
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
hon New Hampshire Department of Safety
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill says you're asking
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could take less that
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
would be great I will do my best thank
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you because many
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
for list listening to my testimony so uh
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell uh this is a public safety
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
issue it's a clearly a safety
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
inspection and um some of the research
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we have done for the model year
 
04:47:53.948 --> 04:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
20122 there were 117 vehicles that were
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
failed um because of safety issues and
 
04:47:56.600 --> 04:47:57.708 align:start position:0%
failed um because of safety issues and
for

04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
2023 there were 140 so these are brand
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
new vehicles um that somebody came in
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
and purchased and then subsequently had
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
them inspected um within a reasonable
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
period of time within 20 days so there
 
04:48:15.070 --> 04:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
are problems that are found and it's
 
04:48:18.430 --> 04:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
just not minor things brakes tires
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
exhaust and steering so we're mandated
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
with um keeping the road safe and this
 
04:48:30.190 --> 04:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
is just one component of
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
that is that um when somebody buys a new
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
car they're under the impression that
 
04:48:38.430 --> 04:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
everything's new everything should be
 
04:48:41.948 --> 04:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
good to go for a period of time um that
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
with those statistics that's clearly not
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
the point or the the case so one of the
 
04:48:50.430 --> 04:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
things that the sponsor was talking
 
04:48:52.590 --> 04:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
about was that if he buys a vehicle in
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
March of 20 24 it doesn't need to be
 
04:48:57.628 --> 04:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
inspected again until 2026 I will tell
 
04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
you that in that two-year period um my
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
work vehicle puts almost 70,000 miles on
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
in a two-year period
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
so um brakes tires and a number of other
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
components certainly could wear out
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
easily in that period of time um and for
 
04:49:17.310 --> 04:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
those who commute uh long distances you
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
can certainly put on 3540 45 50,000
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
miles in a year so going a whole 24mth
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
period um without a a safety inspection
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
it just does not make sense to us and
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
again this this is a safety inspection
 
04:49:38.190 --> 04:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
also while they're doing the safety
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
inspection they're looking at recalls um
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
for deficiencies that have been called
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
out by the manufacturer or the
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
NTSB and additionally without this
 
04:49:50.600 --> 04:49:52.110 align:start position:0%
NTSB and additionally without this
um

04:49:52.110 --> 04:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
the somebody trying to challenge getting
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
something repaired from a dealership uh
 
04:50:00.548 --> 04:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
we go through arbitration um at least a
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
couple times a month to try to get
 
04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
people's Vehicles fixed from the
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
manufacture sure when uh problems are
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
identified later on this certainly would
 
04:50:13.708 --> 04:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
would help um mitigate some of those
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you very much do you have
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh the statistics that you referred to
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the new vehicles that
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
failed how many again and for what
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
reason did they fail so uh for
 
04:50:36.510 --> 04:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
2022 the new vehicle sold in 2022
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
117 vehicles and this
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of things however Wheels
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
tires steering
 
04:50:52.270 --> 04:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.150 --> 04:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
exhaust yeah I'm just instead of I I I
 
04:50:56.830 --> 04:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
heard you I just didn't know if you so
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
117 2022 vehicles and
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
110 2023 Vehicles okay I just didn't
 
04:51:04.590 --> 04:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
know if had something you could give to
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
the committee with those statistics we
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
can certainly forward something if you
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
could that'd be great just U it's a
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
surprising number so I'd like to see it
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
a little little deeper very good what's
 
04:51:18.910 --> 04:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
up right right well that's
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
part but how how many were actually
 
04:51:23.708 --> 04:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
inspected yes okay yeah the big picture
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
too okay thank you our our partners at
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
The Amp dealer Association probably um
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
Supply that easier than I but yes we
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
could certainly get that to you all
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
right the more the better uh any other
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:51:37.628 --> 04:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
representative SES thank you Mr chairman
 
04:51:39.788 --> 04:51:39.798 align:start position:0%
um Trooper this may not be your area of
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
expertise so feel free to hand it off to
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
someone else but in your um tracking of
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
data about new vehicles that are failing
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
inspections are you able to
 
04:51:56.110 --> 04:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
differentiate between um owner if you
 
04:51:58.590 --> 04:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
will occupied cars and Rental Vehicles
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
which are typically new but have very
 
04:52:00.920 --> 04:52:02.628 align:start position:0%
which are typically new but have very
high

04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
mileage given the information I have
 
04:52:05.708 --> 04:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
right in front of me no I can't
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
you and actually to go along with
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative sites is there any way to
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
differentiate personally owned Vehicles
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
versus company-owned Vehicles because in
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
your case I believe 70,000 miles a year
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's the average for
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles correct I would
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
imagine uh we can get that information
 
04:52:30.510 --> 04:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
from D DMV thank you anybody else from
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
the committee represent
 
04:52:36.510 --> 04:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
C thanks to protect my question um what
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
I was uh interested in is
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
um if the U inspection I I bought a car
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
from a dealer and they included the
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
inspection with it and and I can go back
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
every year and get a free inspection are
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
they required to uh notify me if they
 
04:52:59.230 --> 04:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
fixed anything based on that he could
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
have done something under warranty and
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is yes if if it's gone
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
in for an inspection and something
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
failed you're you have to be notified of
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
the deficiency and again going back to
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire deals Association I
 
04:53:16.990 --> 04:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that they have to ask
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
permission to get it fixed unless it's a
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
warranty item which I'm almost positive
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
that they would notify you if they
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
repaired something okay thank you sure
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else seeing none thank you very
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:53:35.990 --> 04:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
you uh next
 
04:53:39.510 --> 04:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
up guess we'll go with Dan weed weed
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
Family Auto in a post a post of the bill
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh seeking three
 
04:53:45.680 --> 04:53:47.708 align:start position:0%
uh seeking three
minutes

04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
welcome council members thank you very
 
04:53:52.350 --> 04:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
much appreciate your time today a couple
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
of quick questions to the sponsors how
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
would you propose that uh law
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement handle stopping cars without
 
04:54:01.070 --> 04:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
stickers and how is law enforcement
 
04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to know what the purchase an
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
iversary of a vehicle is based on the
 
04:54:06.750 --> 04:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
wording in this bill so those are my
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
couple of quick questions for the
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor to clear up some safety concerns
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
that I have uh there are many vehicles
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
out there that within two years that'll
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
have 40 to 50,000 miles on them we
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
currently at the shop have one state
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
agency vehicle ironically that's four
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
years old with 170,000 miles on it
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
that's 42,000 miles a
 
04:54:28.990 --> 04:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
year um that car would not have seen its
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
first inspection till 84,000 Mi on a
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis we vehicles at the shop
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
that are less than 2 years old that need
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
repairs for safety reasons worn tires
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
steering suspension
 
04:54:43.548 --> 04:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
lights a couple of case in points um my
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
wife's personal uh Chevy Blazer 2019
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
within the first year it needed rear
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
suspension work uh that the dealer
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover under
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
warranty uh we've had several Teslas in
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
now with less than 15,000 miles with
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
steel cord showing through the
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
tires uh if the prim goal is cost
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
savings to the constituents and I think
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
the inspection program is doing a good
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
job proactively by finding the repairs
 
04:55:11.788 --> 04:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
that are needed it's certainly less
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
expensive to do and perform a proactive
 
04:55:16.548 --> 04:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
repair than it is to do a breakdown or
 
04:55:21.310 --> 04:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
emergent repair um you are asking Motor
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
Vehicles for some data as far as annual
 
04:55:26.190 --> 04:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
mileage so this is out of my own
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
database at the
 
04:55:31.868 --> 04:55:31.878 align:start position:0%
shop um 2022 Chevy Silverado personal
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle 42 8133
 
04:55:40.030 --> 04:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
miles uh Ford Maverick
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
2,839 Honda Passport
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
30,50 so these are mileages within a
 
04:55:47.708 --> 04:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
year of time that people are putting on
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:54.910 --> 04:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
basis and I'm happy to share the data
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah anything you've got and you can
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
offer the committee it'd be appreciated
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee well do
 
04:56:02.070 --> 04:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
you want to take questions yeah happy to
 
04:56:06.190 --> 04:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
see you representative Hill he's being
 
04:56:08.430 --> 04:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
nice thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um you see on a
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
regular basis um I'm assuming you're
 
04:56:16.590 --> 04:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
saying that you're seeing them other
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
than the inspection so you're seeing
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
them for oil changes or something else
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct you know it's not
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily in just for an inspection
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's during routine maintenance and
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
regular shop visits so I assume when
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
someone comes in for an oil change you
 
04:56:32.948 --> 04:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
do give it the the the once over a look
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
around and see if there's wires poking
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the tires or something
 
04:56:41.470 --> 04:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
like that yeah so it it may be that you
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
would still be doing the work and still
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
be providing your customer the the
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
information of what's necessary on the
 
04:56:52.510 --> 04:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
car even though it's not an inspection
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
process is that right so we have a
 
04:56:57.070 --> 04:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
visual inspection that we do uh as part
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
of every visit so it's not a thorough as
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
thorough as a state inspection is so
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
there there are people that I know in
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
different states without inspection
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
programs that offer as a service to
 
04:57:12.030 --> 04:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
their customer at retail rates a annual
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
inspection that is typically a two or
 
04:57:17.070 --> 04:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
three page report uh but it is at market
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
rate so our inspection programs now our
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
fee at the shop is
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
$46.95 uh market rate for the service
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we provide for a state inspection
 
04:57:29.230 --> 04:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
would be closer to $150 to
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
$200 sounds like a great marketing tool
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions seea thank you very
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next up Michael

04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
see and looking for five
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.830 --> 04:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
better good afternoon Mr chair members
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Michael
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald I'm the assistant director of
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
The Air Resource division at the
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
with me is Jessica Wilcox who runs our
 
04:58:13.150 --> 04:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
motor uh uh vehicle programs uh vehicle
 
04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
emissions programs um as you may be
 
04:58:18.270 --> 04:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
aware the state uh vehicle emissions
 
04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
inspection is conducted in conjunction
 
04:58:21.868 --> 04:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
with the safety
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
inspection um and as I said uh as was
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm not we're not taking a
 
04:58:29.708 --> 04:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
particular position we support the
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety's um position
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
relative to safety but we're not here to
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
talk about safety issues um our our uh
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
concern is with the uh emissions
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
inspection and uh you may be aware that
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
the emissions inspection is uh required
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
under state law RSA
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
26659 B and uh it is also uh part of uh
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
air quality requirements that uh we uh
 
04:59:03.150 --> 04:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
require as a result of the Clean Air Act
 
04:59:05.470 --> 04:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
act for vehicle emissions
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
inspections and um our vehicle emissions
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
inspection program including our
 
04:59:14.110 --> 04:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
statutes and our uh Rule and the rules
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety has their
 
04:59:17.788 --> 04:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
department of safety rules we work
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with them um those are ins
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
sconed in what's known as our state
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
implementation plan it's an EPA required
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's called a sep siip and that uh
 
04:59:33.070 --> 04:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
that document is federally enforcable um
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
so where we don't necessarily oppose the
 
04:59:39.868 --> 04:59:39.878 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill um we would want to
 
04:59:42.430 --> 04:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
note that it would take us approximately
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
18 to 24 months to work with the EPA to
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
get the the new
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
rules um to get the a to get the rules
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
revised uh work with the Department of
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
Safety on that and B to uh then get that
 
04:59:59.070 --> 04:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
into EPA and get that submitted and
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
approved um currently the inspector
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh emissions inspection enforcement
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism is the sticker you you you
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
have a sticker and and so um if you
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
don't pass you know you get a partial
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
sticker and uh EPA has indicated to us
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
that if we did go to them with a
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
revision to our sip uh if we did revise
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
our rules that um as a result of the
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
Inspector General audit of the EPA a
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago um they the
 
05:00:33.390 --> 05:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
Inspector General found that they were
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
not enforcing the uh vehicle inspection
 
05:00:38.830 --> 05:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
programs appropriately and EPA has
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that they may require
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we have other types of inspect of
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
inspection enforcement such as um the
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh registration denial if
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
you're not properly inspected that sort
 
05:00:56.190 --> 05:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
of thing um now obviously um we would
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
need to work with EPA but my main
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
primary Point here is that we would need
 
05:01:02.350 --> 05:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 18 to 24 months to
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
implement this change and not have EPA
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh impose Federal sanctions on us
 
05:01:12.548 --> 05:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
those sanctions can include up to
 
05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
potential loss of Federal Highway funds
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh and um we certainly don't anticipate
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
such a thing taking effect we have a
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
good partnership with EPA we think we
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
could work with them um but also it
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
would would I would have noted that we
 
05:01:30.910 --> 05:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh the emissions reductions that we get
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of this program uh if we
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
don't if we don't get those reductions
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
um they have to be made up elsewhere so
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
those reductions would have to come from
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
um businesses or other other types of um
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh emissions programs within the state
 
05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
again that's something we'd have to work
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
with EPA on we'd have to go to them
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
provide modeling show what we're getting
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
for reductions and then then get those
 
05:02:00.190 --> 05:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
reductions elsewhere so uh again my key
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
point is we would certainly need some
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
time um so if you were to consider that
 
05:02:07.150 --> 05:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
this bill should move forward we'd ask
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
that you can give consideration to um
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
the emissions inspection program uh and
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
allow some time uh in the bill for for
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
us to uh work with EPA and to get our
 
05:02:21.628 --> 05:02:21.638 align:start position:0%
state implementation plan uh revised and
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
on thank you very much I'm going to lead
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
off uh you can you just rep repeat what
 
05:02:36.750 --> 05:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
I thought you said about the Federal
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency
 
05:02:42.430 --> 05:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
threatening to deny registrations to the
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
people of New
 
05:02:46.708 --> 05:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what's not complied with well
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
C currently our inm program does not
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
require registration denial for if if
 
05:02:55.350 --> 05:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
your vehicle hasn't been inspected uh
 
05:02:57.390 --> 05:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
for for the emissions
 
05:03:02.110 --> 05:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
portion um but that is uh again there
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
was an an EPA Inspector General report
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
that was done a couple of years ago they
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
pointed out that EPA was not meeting the
 
05:03:12.030 --> 05:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
letter of the queen Air Act and
 
05:03:14.788 --> 05:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
therefore um they would they have
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that they would most
 
05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
likely require part part of our sip not
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
only is is the inspection and so on but
 
05:03:24.750 --> 05:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
how we enforce it we have to we have to
 
05:03:26.830 --> 05:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
give them information on how it's
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
enforced and and so on and they have
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
indicated that the current uh sticker
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
partial sticker uh method of enforcement
 
05:03:40.990 --> 05:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
may not be adequate um again we'd have
 
05:03:43.548 --> 05:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
to work with them that's not stone is
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
there any way you could get the
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee a copy of that report oh
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly sure thank you
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
that'd be helpful sure and while I've
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
got the mic um I've heard this starting
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
my 12th year uh that if we make changes
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
for the Clean Air Act or our statutes in
 
05:04:00.430 --> 05:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the emissions that we're going
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
to lose money for the highway fund
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
in 12 years have asking how much money
 
05:04:08.670 --> 05:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose if we decide not to
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
comply how much are we talking does
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
anybody know
 
05:04:14.590 --> 05:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
yet well the state currently receives
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the order of 100 I don't
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
have anybody from the Department of
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation but we receive on the
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
order of $100 million in in Federal
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
Highway Aid I I I want to stress I want
 
05:04:26.430 --> 05:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
to be very careful that's that's a
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
potential but that would certainly be a
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
long way down the road um and and I
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't think EPA would want to impose
 
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of a sanction on New Hampshire
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
they could impose other that's that's
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
the highest sanction they could impose
 
05:04:44.670 --> 05:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
other sanctions such as requiring
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
additional um reductions from industry
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
or things like that and we would
 
05:04:51.990 --> 05:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
certainly work to avoid that I just want
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
to that it's out there y That's I don't
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
mean don't mean it as a threat I
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh I've got one more not
 
05:05:02.670 --> 05:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
to hug it folks uh I can either ask you
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
or Department of Motor Vehicles we're
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
currently under contract for the
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
emissions testing with Gordon Darby does
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room know when that
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
up okay and I'll so if you get the
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
answer I'll I'll hit you in a minute
 
05:05:19.160 --> 05:05:21.230 align:start position:0%
answer I'll I'll hit you in a minute
representative

05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
stair thank you Mr
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
chair I a quick quick question here I
 
05:05:27.628 --> 05:05:27.638 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
05:05:29.470 --> 05:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
Colorado and I'm not sure about the
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
other states but Colorado does not
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
require vehicle inspection however they
 
05:05:36.670 --> 05:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
do have the same situation you're
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
talking about with with how do they do
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know how that program
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
works I am not familiar in particular we
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
certainly can can look look at that
 
05:05:48.190 --> 05:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
program and get back to you with some
 
05:05:51.310 --> 05:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
information but I don't I don't have I
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure what specifically about
 
05:05:55.470 --> 05:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
it you're asking but I I certainly can
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
provide you with information on are you
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the enforcement of it well
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
how do they how I mean I I'm kind of
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
aware how they do it but I think it's
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
something that would be wonderful for
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
our state to know how these many states
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
that don't have a vehicle inspection how
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
they run their emissions okay
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
inspections and one thing I'll point out
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
to you also is that New Hampshire is in
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
what's known as the ozone transport
 
05:06:20.430 --> 05:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
region which is the States from Virginia
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
to Maine and so the Clean Air Act
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
imposes additional requirements on those
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
states that they don't impose on other
 
05:06:29.788 --> 05:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
other states because because of our
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
ozone uh uh pollution problem and so um
 
05:06:38.548 --> 05:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
that our our being in the O
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
OTR has some additional requirements so
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe Colorado I believe
 
05:06:46.590 --> 05:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
Colorado especially Denver represent
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
well I was going to make a statement not
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
a question well we don't we don't do
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
that we only have time for questions all
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
right follow up I just want to say
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
Denver does have a very so you're going
 
05:06:57.548 --> 05:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
to make the statement I I'm going to re
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
read Denver has a very sensitive air
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
quality situation out there yeah yes so
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
I would if you could find out again how
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
they do this out there that would be
 
05:07:11.310 --> 05:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you I I would will
 
05:07:13.150 --> 05:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
Jessica would be happy to look that up
 
05:07:15.788 --> 05:07:15.798 align:start position:0%
for you
 
05:07:19.390 --> 05:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman sir yes
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you talked about
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
how one of the
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
possibility possibilities of concern is
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
that the EPA
 
05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
may require additional changes in how we
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
deal with air quality here in the state
 
05:07:36.240 --> 05:07:37.110 align:start position:0%
deal with air quality here in the state
and

05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:41.270 --> 05:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
you um somewhat obliquely referred to
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps industry or whatever might be
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
made to make up the difference right my
 
05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
is can you give me a rough percentages
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
of how much of the air quality problem
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
comes from Motor Vehicles comes from
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
industry and comes from other sources so
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
that we can see what room there might be
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
sure to for that in fact to make a
 
05:08:10.830 --> 05:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
substantial difference leaving them less
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
Choice yeah we we provided you with a
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
letter um and uh that indicates that
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
probably about half the ozone forming
 
05:08:20.350 --> 05:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
comp U emissions in the state come from
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles um
 
05:08:27.628 --> 05:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
however in in the changes that this bill
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
contemplates would not affect all the
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles it would only affect those
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
two you know the first two year so it
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be a much much smaller percentage
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
of that but still the EPA has the the
 
05:08:42.990 --> 05:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act uh not not the EPA but
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act itself has a
 
05:08:46.830 --> 05:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
requirement known as antib backsliding
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
which basically the way I generally
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
explain it to people is if you're on a
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
diet and you lose 100
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
pounds you can't just go back and start
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
eating cheeseburgers tomorrow and expect
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
to have have your uh weight the way it
 
05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
is we've achieved clean air by
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
implementing certain programs and the
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
anti-b backsliding provision of the
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act says you have to continue
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
those programs in order to make sure
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
that the air is maintained clean and so
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
therefore we would have to go look at
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
how much reduction we're getting what
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose and then make make
 
05:09:30.990 --> 05:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
provision okay if I can ask one more
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
question sure uh back to the ozone you
 
05:09:38.190 --> 05:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
otaa I believe you said OTR ozone
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
transport region uh in terms of our air
 
05:09:44.190 --> 05:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
quality and you mentioned that 50% of it
 
05:09:44.200 --> 05:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
quality and you mentioned that 50% of it
was

05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
automobiles how many what's the
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of New Hampshire's
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
automobiles that affects our air quality
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
or we under these rules because of the
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
high Dent states that are below us in a
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
weather pattern so in other words are we
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
falling into a certain level of
 
05:10:01.600 --> 05:10:02.670 align:start position:0%
falling into a certain level of
Correction

05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
Correction
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
because of New York Connecticut and you
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
know everybody below us with with their
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
material flowing our way to to some
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
degree that's a valid observation um yes
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
our air quality is impacted by by other
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
states but and and we work with them to
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that they put you know take
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
care of the problems that they need to
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
take care of um one of the ways that I
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
generally point it that is is to say
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that um we need to have clean hands when
 
05:10:33.230 --> 05:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
we point to them we need to have
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
implemented at least the the basic
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
requirements um that the Clean Air Act
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
implements we're asking them to go way
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
further and to to get reductions from
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
power plants and you know all kinds of
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
different sources um we we need to have
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
at least implemented the minimum
 
05:10:54.990 --> 05:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
requirements anybody else from the
 
05:10:57.150 --> 05:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee and we do have four other
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak so you know uh
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
so even if we got rid of the inspection
 
05:11:08.910 --> 05:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
sticker we're not saying 100% of those
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles are going to start failing so
 
05:11:13.230 --> 05:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
there again it's the failure rate might
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
be ever so slight that it would not
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
change one bit of this G quality all
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
that was I I would not say it that that
 
05:11:23.190 --> 05:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
slow but but it would there would be an
 
05:11:26.510 --> 05:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
impact but it would not be a a huge huge
 
05:11:26.520 --> 05:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
impact but it would not be a a huge huge
impact

05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:11:30.270 --> 05:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
so that again we'd have to work with EPA
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
do the modeling come up with estimates
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
and so on and that would that would take
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
some time the bigger thing that I'm
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
worried about
 
05:11:41.788 --> 05:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
is right now if we continue the way we
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
are we're we're okay the EPA is not
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to do anything but if if we do go
 
05:11:50.110 --> 05:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
to them and say we want to do new rules
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
then they've indicated that they they
 
05:11:56.350 --> 05:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
would want to implement the uh other
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms and that's that
 
05:11:58.400 --> 05:11:59.788 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms and that's that
concerns

05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
me anybody else from the committee
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
you and anything you can share with us
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated I'm sorry anything
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
you can share with us we'll get back to
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
with the information that was requested
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh next up Tim
 
05:12:15.120 --> 05:12:19.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh next up Tim
Jordan

05:12:19.230 --> 05:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
who we got a skeleton crew going
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
on see you next week uh next up Tim
 
05:12:29.310 --> 05:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
Jordan uh represent autoair in
 
05:12:31.470 --> 05:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill looking for three
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman good
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon how um very good um one of the
 
05:12:37.230 --> 05:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
things I'm going to go over is just
 
05:12:39.150 --> 05:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
partially the safety part of it and I
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
know that um it's gone over a little bit
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
but you you had asked about you know if
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
these people are coming in regular I get
 
05:12:47.548 --> 05:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of vehicles that come in that we
 
05:12:51.310 --> 05:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
saw a lot of small Vans for um
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
contractors um plumbers electricians uh
 
05:12:57.070 --> 05:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
cable independent cable guys these guys
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
are putting 30 40,000 miles a year on
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
their vehicle you know so they're coming
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
in so I'm mean a 2E they're pushing
 
05:13:06.910 --> 05:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
these things to 60 70 880,000 miles
 
05:13:10.190 --> 05:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
myself personally my wife and I she
 
05:13:12.430 --> 05:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
drives 120 miles a day I drive 100 miles
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
a day so you know we put 35,000 miles
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
37,000 miles a year on a vehicle so I
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
mean the safety part of it tires these
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
days I mean tires they're wearing out
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bel low State spec uh standards on a lot
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
of these SUVs especially EVS um you know
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing 25 26 28 30,000 mies I mean
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
you need tires nowadays um so I mean
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
you're running into you know these
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you know may only come in
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
for their state inspection you know and
 
05:13:46.110 --> 05:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
they're you know we're going to not have
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
these cars in some people just don't
 
05:13:49.350 --> 05:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
take care of their car there people that
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
take care of their cars yeah we see that
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and they're going to
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
get it fixed but a lot of not all of
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
those people some of those people are
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
going to say well I don't have the money
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
now I don't want to do it and then you
 
05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
have the people that just don't just
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
drive their vehicles you know and again
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
if this is something that's for uh you
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
know as you mentioned convenience and
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
cost for these people I mean if you get
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who has you know most car
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
warranties are you know good for 3 years
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
36,000 miles whatever comes first so as
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
these people are driving these things
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
40,000 miles never get inspected you
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
know if they had inspected within that
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
time I mean they may have a component
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
that would have been covered in a
 
05:14:26.430 --> 05:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
warranty when we did the state
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
inspection that they're never going to
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
see now we're going to do it two years
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
later a component that may have been
 
05:14:33.548 --> 05:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
failed previously that would have cost a
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
customer nothing now they're paying out
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
of pocket for that so I mean in the
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
monetary part of a state inspection I
 
05:14:41.788 --> 05:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
mean $45 I mean if you're buying a new
 
05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
car you know you're spending you know I
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't even know what the cheapest cars
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
you can buy these days you're spending
 
05:14:50.910 --> 05:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
30 40 5080 $90,000 per car I mean $45
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
that's a cup of coffee a month you know
 
05:14:55.150 --> 05:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
so I mean the monetary part of it and
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
the inconvenience part yeah it's
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to bring the car in but
 
05:14:59.708 --> 05:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
realistically you know most state
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
inspections you know you can them done
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's an hour out of your day
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't think that's a lot
 
05:15:08.590 --> 05:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
to ask to make sure that we have you
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
know good tires I mean they mentioned
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
component failure I mean I don't know if
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
tires really fall fall into that
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
component failure and I'm sure there's a
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
lot of accidents of tires you see
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
especially here you see cars sliding all
 
05:15:20.430 --> 05:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
over the place I mean if it's you know
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
worn tires I mean does that fall into a
 
05:15:24.070 --> 05:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
component I don't know but just
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
something that we see a lot more uh
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
premature tire wear on vehicles these
 
05:15:30.990 --> 05:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
days than I have I've been doing this
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
for you know 30 plus years and you know
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
these last four or five 10 years you
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
know tires used to be a 45,000 M 50,000
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
mile at them they're not anymore they
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't go 30,000 M so these vehicles are
 
05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to be you know driven I think well
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
past that point and are they safe you
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
know if you got tires that don't pass I
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's the biggest item and we
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
still see breaks that fail in short
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
period and not only that I mean they're
 
05:15:59.548 --> 05:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
all mechanical components I mean
 
05:16:01.070 --> 05:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
anything can fail at any time I mean you
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
might lose your brake lights you don't
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
know how many people in the room would
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
know that your brake lights aren't
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
working you know until you know you had
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
it inspected or somebody said something
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
to you so there's a lot of things not
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
just where but components that could get
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
caught ahead of time that just aren't
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
going to be seen till you know whether
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's 24 months could go up to 30 months
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
the way this is written so I mean that's
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of miles for somebody who's
 
05:16:26.590 --> 05:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
putting more miles than I see in my shop
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
a lot more higher mileage vehicles in in
 
05:16:32.548 --> 05:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
low time in use uh I think people
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
commuting you know the influx of people
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
into Southern New Hampshire they're
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
still commuting into Boston because they
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
moved up here for cheap things so we see
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
um a lot higher mileage vehicles in a
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
short period of time than we have in the
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
last you know 10 years or
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much I do have one
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
question for you y you said you noticed
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
a tire wearing out much quicker than you
 
05:16:54.430 --> 05:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
did in the past
 
05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
yepes is is some of that attributed to
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
the additional weight of electric
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles so in your experience
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
how much heavier percentage wise an
 
05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle versus its internal
 
05:17:08.670 --> 05:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
combustion engine counterpart so uh the
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
electrical the electric vehicles other
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
worse are a little heavier and you know
 
05:17:14.548 --> 05:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody driven one but
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
when you're braking instead of using
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
your engine brakes it's doing
 
05:17:20.590 --> 05:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
regenerative braking so all that energy
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
is taken up at those wheels and tires
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's getting pushed down there so it's
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
like you know hitting the gas as hard as
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
you can and hitting the brake as hard as
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
you can every time because even if
 
05:17:33.750 --> 05:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're not using your brakes essentially
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
the car is breaking and all that energy
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
is getting transferred through the tires
 
05:17:38.670 --> 05:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
and that's where you're losing awar so I
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
mean EVS are really hard on tires and
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
there's so many vehicles now that are
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive uh in full full-time
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
four-wheel drive part-time four-wheel
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
drive so I mean they're you know they
 
05:17:52.830 --> 05:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot more rolling force that
 
05:17:54.270 --> 05:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
they're working against so I mean you
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
get a lot more of that uh and I think
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's a big ATT tribute and I think the
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
quality of Just Tires in general just
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
isn't there from what they used to be
 
05:18:03.788 --> 05:18:03.798 align:start position:0%
all right thank you maybe we can only do
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
this for internal combustion who knows
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else from the
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
committee see then thank you very much
 
05:18:10.638 --> 05:18:11.350 align:start position:0%
committee see then thank you very much
thank

05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
you uh next
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
up John morasco director Department of
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in opposition to the bill
 
05:18:20.200 --> 05:18:25.030 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in opposition to the bill
welcome

05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be brief um I apologize
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
if I didn't have enough copies of our
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony that's a department of
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
safety um opposition letter to the bill
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
um I won't go through everything that's
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the letter or read it aloud but um
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
maybe just touch on a couple of the the
 
05:18:45.150 --> 05:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
points that were brought up earlier with
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
regards to um inspections uh inspection
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
station practices uh you know we have um
 
05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
automotive equipment inspector Ken
 
05:18:54.910 --> 05:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
chaput here from the State Police Troop
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
G and um I read the uh the audits when
 
05:18:59.070 --> 05:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
they're done in different uh on
 
05:19:00.910 --> 05:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
different inspection stations I see the
 
05:19:02.910 --> 05:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
good work that the uh the AIS and
 
05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
Troopers do to make sure that inspection
 
05:19:08.190 --> 05:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
stations are in compliance with um with
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do per the uh
 
05:19:12.750 --> 05:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
per the L and the DMV rule set um but
 
05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
when there is an issue and there is uh
 
05:19:16.750 --> 05:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
an inspection station that U might be
 
05:19:18.910 --> 05:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of a customer um that
 
05:19:20.910 --> 05:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
will come out in an audit that uh Ken
 
05:19:23.070 --> 05:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
and his team will provide um and then
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
there'll be uh there'll be a hearing and
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
sanctions for that um so those are going
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
on and whenever we get a you know a
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
complaint that comes in um then we relay
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
that Troop G and um then the AIS will go
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
out and take care of an audit
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for that complaint the
 
05:19:38.830 --> 05:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that we did even since the
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
last session is look at um highlighting
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for consumers to um file
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
complaints if they feel like they've
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
gone in for a state inspection then I'll
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
feel like um that the failure is
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
Justified we've actually made a change
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
to the vehicle inspection report uh
 
05:19:57.150 --> 05:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
working with Gordon Darby to to do that
 
05:19:58.948 --> 05:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
so that it's it's front and center there
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
with a with a call-in number um that
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
will be fielded by Troop G and um and
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
then at that point followed up on with
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
whatever that complaint is um and then
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing I just want to touch
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
upon was uh both of those I mean fall
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
into the the category of transparency um
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
but recently within the last you know
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
few months we had an opportunity to go
 
05:20:22.390 --> 05:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
up to groni Mazda here in conquer and uh
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
Amanda mmer was kind enough to set up a
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
tour um and an observation of how they
 
05:20:29.788 --> 05:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
run their inspections there which uh is
 
05:20:32.670 --> 05:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
the case with many um inspection
 
05:20:34.430 --> 05:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
stations today uh particularly the
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
larger ones but uh for groni they have
 
05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh they have glass there so you can
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
stand there and watch your vehicle get
 
05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
inspected um and then they provide you
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
with a video um after the inspection um
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
that goes through and shows you each
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
point and um you know where it is if
 
05:20:50.948 --> 05:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's a pass or it's right on the cusp uh
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know or or if it's a fail um and one
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the things we learned from that uh
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
that tour was that you have um a lot of
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
customers that um at that point have
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
trust and faith in the business that
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
they were they're dealing with and they
 
05:21:06.670 --> 05:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
actually uh they go right in for the
 
05:21:08.430 --> 05:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
repairs they have that business take
 
05:21:10.830 --> 05:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
care of the repairs so um I guess I
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm trying to say is I think
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of advancements being made
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh on the inspection industry side to
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
make it more transparent more efficient
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
more customer friendly and um you know
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
from a safety standpoint that's why we
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill we think the the yearly
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
inspection is
 
05:21:29.788 --> 05:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate happy to take questions yep
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thanks for your effort
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
at the department any questions
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
first good afternoon good afternoon sir
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you can you tell me you touched on
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
how uh the consumer has now been
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
notified that they can complain or they
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
have any concerns they can reach out
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
with a number and I know we talked about
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
that last year can you tell me how
 
05:21:58.270 --> 05:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's been done so that was um that's
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's new um that was something again
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
working with Gordon Derby we just
 
05:22:03.788 --> 05:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
recently had a meeting with Gordon
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
Darby's leadership team uh where we
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
finalized what that vehicle inspection
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
report the language on there would look
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
like um so I'm not sure Ken if we've
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
officially rolled that out um because
 
05:22:18.830 --> 05:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
that meeting was just recently it is in
 
05:22:21.868 --> 05:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
process it's in process so um we have it
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's there it's taking a while to get
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
there but um but it's it's going to be
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
coming out so the answer your question
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative I don't have the feedback
 
05:22:31.708 --> 05:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
on it yet um but once once the first
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
three months go by after it's live then
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
that um so are we still talking about
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
signage that's something that somebody
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a Ser in a dealership can just look
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
up at the wall when they come in and see
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
this written out in black and white so
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
they can read it right there we're open
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
to anything I think the vehicle
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
inspection report was something that we
 
05:22:59.788 --> 05:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
we had spoken about as a as a first step
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
um to put it front and center on the
 
05:23:03.150 --> 05:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
report that everybody gets in hand so
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
that you you see it there you see the
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
number and we have a plan internally
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
through Troop G to follow up when those
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
calls come in um but I think if if we
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
measure it um say over the first 90 days
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we see what we're getting for
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
feedback um what what Troop G actually
 
05:23:20.750 --> 05:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
gets for phone calls versus what elected
 
05:23:22.270 --> 05:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
officials get for complaints that we're
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
not getting then at that point um again
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're open to anything if it ends up
 
05:23:29.230 --> 05:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
being signage um we just figure out how
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
big the sign's going to be where it's
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to be h who's going to produce it
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
but um making sure that the customer
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
feels like they have an Avenue um if
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
they've been mistreated we need to do
 
05:23:39.878 --> 05:23:40.708 align:start position:0%
they've been mistreated we need to do
that

05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to speak with you further
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
about it well I can't make any
 
05:23:46.990 --> 05:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
statements so thank you very much and
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
again too uh I I applaud all the efforts
 
05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
and I thank you these are things that
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about for a couple of
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
years trying to make people hate the
 
05:23:56.670 --> 05:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
program less uh and that's the ultimate
 
05:23:58.270 --> 05:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
goal but in the meantime let's talk
 
05:23:59.548 --> 05:23:59.558 align:start position:0%
about what we've got in front of us
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
which is this bill not some of the other
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
efforts uh any other representative I
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
think I saw him next sorry
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative SES thank you Mr chairman
 
05:24:08.520 --> 05:24:09.470 align:start position:0%
representative SES thank you Mr chairman
director

05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
director
 
05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
morasco do you have data
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
showing the numbers of complaints versus
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
the number of inspections on a yearly
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
basis because I we all get all of US
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
representatives get calls from
 
05:24:29.070 --> 05:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
constituents who are concerned about the
 
05:24:34.830 --> 05:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
process but if I have in my district
 
05:24:38.590 --> 05:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
have 12,000 cars get inspected and I get
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
one complaint it puts a colorization on
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
the the problem different than it might
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
be if I have 12,000 in my district
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
and a thousand are complaining do you
 
05:24:52.990 --> 05:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
have that data it's a great question um
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
I did sign for Kathy Diamond uh
 
05:24:56.868 --> 05:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
registration supervisor to come up as
 
05:24:58.750 --> 05:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
well but I I wrote it very in very small
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
print sir so uh off to the side but Kath
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
if we um if it'll be okay for Kathy to
 
05:25:05.788 --> 05:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
see if we have that that
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
data it's it's off to the margin I
 
05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
promise um so right now unfortunately I
 
05:25:13.270 --> 05:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't have that data we do have somebody
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
who does take those complaints and we do
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on each and every one that we
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
do receive but I don't have that data
 
05:25:18.718 --> 05:25:21.670 align:start position:0%
do receive but I don't have that data
with

05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
me so I obviously I can't direct the
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
director to do anything but that I think
 
05:25:29.948 --> 05:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
that data is critical to the discussions
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we're having and I would hope to
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
see it before we actually exect this
 
05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill we get that for
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
you we we will we will representative
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
sites we'll we'll confer with Troop G
 
05:25:42.670 --> 05:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
and see what's coming that way we can
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
also uh we we have started um within the
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
last I'll give it a rough estimate of of
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
six months um we have a at the DMV get a
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
lot of calls from elected officials uh
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
doing a great job representing
 
05:25:58.270 --> 05:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
constituents and um I'm not so sure we
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
were really tracking that the right way
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
um and years past we are now so we have
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
a great spreadsheet out of the
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
director's office that we keep track of
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
who we're working with what the
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
complaints are and how we're solving the
 
05:26:12.030 --> 05:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
problem so I do have that so we can
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
certainly take a look and see how many
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
on there are inspection related and then
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
work with Ken and his team and uh Kathy
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
and registrations get as much
 
05:26:21.310 --> 05:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
information as we can in a short period
 
05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
of time thank you yeah and I do
 
05:26:24.868 --> 05:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate the short period of time this
 
05:26:26.910 --> 05:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
is an early bill for us so I'm trying to
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
get this out of my committee as soon as
 
05:26:30.350 --> 05:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
possible so it can go to another one and
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
you guys can show up for another hearing
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair um question I
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
have is for the dealer itself I mean
 
05:26:41.948 --> 05:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
that's doing
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
inspections uh how much does their
 
05:26:46.150 --> 05:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
equipment cost do they pay pay for that
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
or is that state owned
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
or yeah that's unless that's probably a
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
better question here for for Ken or
 
05:26:57.310 --> 05:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
industry sir I I don't want to answer
 
05:26:58.948 --> 05:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
that because I'm not quite sure and
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's I know it's a good trivia
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
question but it really doesn't pertain
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill at all can we get that on
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the side that kind of number yeah I
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
guess I can tell you that the Gordon
 
05:27:09.390 --> 05:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
Derby equipment is not paid for I don't
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
believe paid for by the mechanics but in
 
05:27:12.910 --> 05:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the other tools required I
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
believe they have to pay for those
 
05:27:17.708 --> 05:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
themselves so go ahead so so another
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
question I have was I'm just trying to
 
05:27:21.070 --> 05:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
find out how much money is actually
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
involved in in taking care of all these
 
05:27:24.990 --> 05:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
inspections because if we're not doing
 
05:27:27.150 --> 05:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
inspections we don't do them or we're
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of inspections we're
 
05:27:30.910 --> 05:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
going to be saving money and in the
 
05:27:33.990 --> 05:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
Departments and also the Dos as well
 
05:27:35.788 --> 05:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to find out how
 
05:27:38.030 --> 05:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
many people do you have involved you
 
05:27:40.110 --> 05:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
know just around the inspection whole
 
05:27:42.990 --> 05:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
process so I can answer it from a DMV
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint so Kathy and her team in
 
05:27:47.708 --> 05:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
registrations working with Robin on the
 
05:27:49.868 --> 05:27:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh on the dealer desk um working with
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Troop G that's um you know we have how
 
05:27:56.350 --> 05:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
many cats roughly three four people
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
there about five five or six Yeah couple
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
part-timers okay
 
05:28:02.948 --> 05:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
so from a DMV standpoint that's what we
 
05:28:04.708 --> 05:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
have and then I would like Ken speak to
 
05:28:06.430 --> 05:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
what he
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
has well I guess where he was headed
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
then I'll ask the question that doesn't
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
look like even if this were to pass and
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
make the first year exempt that you
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be weighing off anybody or
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
removing anybody from staff no safe to
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
Safe thingk
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
no um okay anybody else from the
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing then thank you very
 
05:28:27.990 --> 05:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
sir okay you you know I like to try to
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
keep things as light as possible and
 
05:28:34.670 --> 05:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
here even discussing some of the most
 
05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
important bills before us so in
 
05:28:42.190 --> 05:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh today we have the epic
 
05:28:44.070 --> 05:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
battle of the Titans for the last two
 
05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
cards that I have left and I can't win
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
if I decide to pick who goes first so I
 
05:28:56.430 --> 05:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
have a coin um Dan Bennet is a head and
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
Tom prol is a
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:02.230 align:start position:0%
Tom prol is a
tail

05:29:02.230 --> 05:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
tail
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
what the heck is that

2024 um for the record my name is Tom
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
prol I'm here today uh representing

Enterprise Mobility which uh operates
 
05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
Enterprise renter car National Car
 
05:29:42.910 --> 05:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
Rental and Alamo Rental Car throughout
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
30 different locations in the state of
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in the past 12 months
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
have operated about 3500 vehicles um I
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
know you've been here a while I know
 
05:29:54.990 --> 05:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot so I do want to touch
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
on just a a few points that I think are
 
05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
really important uh for the committee to
 
05:30:01.310 --> 05:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
hear um
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
first I think it's important to know
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the legislation that's before you
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
is not a New Concept um for example when
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
we look at states in the general area um
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
the state of Rhode Island does not
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
require an inspection for a new vehicle
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the first two years and then after
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
two years you're required uh for the uh
 
05:30:27.230 --> 05:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
safety and Emissions okay that's very
 
05:30:28.948 --> 05:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
similar to our bill however if you buy a
 
05:30:31.390 --> 05:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
used car you are required to get an
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
inspection every year um and then when
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the state of Connecticut
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's law indicates that an
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
inspection on a new car is not needed
 
05:30:42.510 --> 05:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
for the first four years and then after
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
four years only an emissions inspection
 
05:30:47.948 --> 05:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
is required so we're not going that far
 
05:30:50.590 --> 05:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is a common sense approach
 
05:30:53.868 --> 05:30:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh to slightly modify the program as
 
05:30:56.350 --> 05:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
cars have become safer and Emissions
 
05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
reduced now I know the committee was
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
really interested in data I do have some
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
data and I believe the department has
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
data that's more fresh than my data
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
however mine uh I wanted to share what I
 
05:31:12.788 --> 05:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
have from the year
 
05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
2020 and uh if you look at the first
 
05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
inspection okay in the year 2020 for a
 
05:31:20.670 --> 05:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
model year
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
2020 vehicle there were
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
79835 inspections conducted the total
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles that failed for
 
05:31:35.230 --> 05:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
safety were 142 that's
 
05:31:38.830 --> 05:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
0.1% of the vehicles that failed of
 
05:31:44.430 --> 05:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
those 142 46 were for glass and 43 were
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
for vehicle information now it should be
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
noted when we talk about glass failing
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
that glass can refer to anything from
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
chipped glass to tinting to
 
05:31:57.470 --> 05:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
malfunctioning window
 
05:31:59.708 --> 05:31:59.718 align:start position:0%
mechanisms and that was the majority of
 
05:32:03.548 --> 05:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
those sales now in two model year 2020
 
05:32:06.510 --> 05:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles when you look at the second
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
inspection there were
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
79,3 59
 
05:32:16.990 --> 05:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
inspections 9915 failed that's
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
.1% of the number of vehicles failed um
 
05:32:24.510 --> 05:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
of that again glass and tires were the
 
05:32:27.070 --> 05:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
number one reason for those fails now
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
again I know that some folks said well
 
05:32:31.708 --> 05:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
Tires Tires seem to be the popular
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
discussion Point here about wearing out
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
after two years so when you look at
 
05:32:40.110 --> 05:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
those number of tires that failed 300 of
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
the fails of the
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
7935 were for
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:55.548 --> 05:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that you know this is a
 
05:32:57.708 --> 05:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonable
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
measure um now I think it's also
 
05:33:02.270 --> 05:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
important to note as has been stated
 
05:33:04.708 --> 05:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
that these Motor Vehicles are only new
 
05:33:06.910 --> 05:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles they're typically under
 
05:33:09.990 --> 05:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
warranty and uh a couple items that I
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
just took notes on that I figured would
 
05:33:13.390 --> 05:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
come up in questions to me that I wanted
 
05:33:15.708 --> 05:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
to share with you um being that I
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
represent Enterprise Mobility I'm sure
 
05:33:19.948 --> 05:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
the question of how many miles are on
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
those vehicles um per year and I checked
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
with my counterpart and I was informed
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
that typical Enterprise uh car rental
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
will accumulate 20 25,000 m per year the
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
the tires are changed when the tread
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
depths are at 430 seconds of an inch and
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
those tread depths are inspected at the
 
05:33:46.270 --> 05:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
return cleaning inspection and start of
 
05:33:46.280 --> 05:33:47.270 align:start position:0%
return cleaning inspection and start of
every

05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
rental um and lastly I believe it was uh
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
a gentleman that testified um earlier
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
who asked about uh how will law
 
05:33:58.628 --> 05:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement know about cars without
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
stickers um I think this could be easily
 
05:34:03.390 --> 05:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
accomplished in Rule and you put the
 
05:34:07.150 --> 05:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
year number on the windshield um 24 for
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
the model year number of the vehicle
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
that certainly provides law enforcement
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to see um what that is with
 
05:34:16.510 --> 05:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
that I think uh you know I'm happy to
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
try and answer any questions that you
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
may have um I do think that this is a
 
05:34:23.548 --> 05:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
really minor change to the program it
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
does not decimate the program Enterprise
 
05:34:29.070 --> 05:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
certainly supports uh a form of an
 
05:34:31.590 --> 05:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
inspection program I think it's just
 
05:34:34.350 --> 05:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
this is a modest and reasonable
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
change thank you thank you uh questions
 
05:34:40.470 --> 05:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
question happy New Year
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um would you have any idea of the states
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned um that were skipping
 
05:34:53.868 --> 05:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
the emissions whether there was um
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
penalties involved or anything from the
 
05:35:00.750 --> 05:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
EPA for for doing that particular sure I
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
I can certainly check and see I'm not
 
05:35:06.150 --> 05:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
sure when those their inspection changes
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh went into effect in regards with
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
regards to you know the Clean Air Act
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
and how that may have happened but I'm
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to uh research that
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
and look into it for you and how long it
 
05:35:18.510 --> 05:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
took from the time the legislation went
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
through before they it did was it a
 
05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
two-year process that as he mentioned
 
05:35:25.350 --> 05:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
sure thank you oh one other thing I did
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
want to mention because I believe it
 
05:35:28.750 --> 05:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
also came up was in regards to the
 
05:35:31.948 --> 05:35:31.958 align:start position:0%
Gordon Derby uh uh contract I believe
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
that contract expires at the end of this
 
05:35:36.430 --> 05:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
year and there is an option to renew for
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
another two years I believe that's
 
05:35:41.230 --> 05:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank
 
05:35:43.788 --> 05:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative Crawford thank
 
05:35:51.030 --> 05:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
you I have a copy of all the numbers
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
that you just gave absolutely thank you
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
and again I believe that you know
 
05:35:56.708 --> 05:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
director morasco probably has more up to
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
date might only go from 2018 to 2020 but
 
05:36:01.628 --> 05:36:01.638 align:start position:0%
for the sake of
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
conversation representative St
 
05:36:07.310 --> 05:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you I I must have
 
05:36:09.548 --> 05:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
missunderstood I didn't hear you say did
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
I that you that states weren't doing
 
05:36:15.548 --> 05:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
emissions inspections I thought you said
 
05:36:15.558 --> 05:36:16.788 align:start position:0%
emissions inspections I thought you said
that

05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:18.990 --> 05:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut only does the emission
 
05:36:21.868 --> 05:36:21.878 align:start position:0%
connect after four years only does he so
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
did you say a state doesn't do emissions
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
that's I thought you
 
05:36:29.548 --> 05:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
said during the time period dep person
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh oh during the first four years okay
 
05:36:32.400 --> 05:36:33.230 align:start position:0%
oh oh during the first four years okay
all

05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:36:36.270 --> 05:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
right okay that's my understanding he
 
05:36:37.390 --> 05:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
was trying to make it he was trying to
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
get more information on the claims that
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
Dees made in terms of how long it would
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
take the the the federal government of
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
EPA to give us our new requirements if
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
we make changes to to our our current
 
05:36:51.788 --> 05:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
laws if there are if there are any I'm
 
05:36:53.990 --> 05:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
just not sure he's sure that's why I
 
05:36:57.070 --> 05:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
asked that question about four years so
 
05:36:58.750 --> 05:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you that anybody else
 
05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:37:06.510 --> 05:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
you and the next
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
Titan we got to have fun right yeah uh
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Dan Bennett from the
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't know which is worse
 
05:37:25.868 --> 05:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
last before lunch or last before the end
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:34.190 --> 05:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman and committee Dan Bennett
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
you heard from me earlier we're a trade
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Association for the motor vehicle
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
industry here in New Hampshire I will be
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
brief I'm going to bounce around I'm not
 
05:37:43.788 --> 05:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
going to uh stick to my written
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that I have uh but we'll
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.390 --> 05:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and then I have some stuff that I'll
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh kind kind of show around so um
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
leading off um you know the this it's
 
05:38:01.948 --> 05:38:01.958 align:start position:0%
our opinion that safety inspection isn't
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
broken it works it works well and when
 
05:38:07.030 --> 05:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
it needs tweaks it gets them um it gets
 
05:38:09.470 --> 05:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
them with a scalpel not a hatchet and
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's like what you did this summer with
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
HP 664 you identified problems you
 
05:38:15.390 --> 05:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
studied them you researched them and you
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
came up with some solutions director
 
05:38:18.830 --> 05:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
morasco talked about a couple of those
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
before uh this bill is not about brand
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
new cars brand new cars are ones that
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
roll off the vehicle or the trailer
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
straight from Detroit right 23 months
 
05:38:31.628 --> 05:38:31.638 align:start position:0%
into a vehicle life cycle is is is not a
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
brand new car uh you heard from the
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
experts the folks who see them day in
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
day out on what they kind of see um I
 
05:38:40.830 --> 05:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
I've used this with the committee before
 
05:38:42.468 --> 05:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
because you've heard the bill numerous
 
05:38:44.670 --> 05:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
times when we talk about other states we
 
05:38:46.430 --> 05:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
need to be very very careful and we need
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're doing Apples to
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
Apples so um I'll send this around to
 
05:38:52.390 --> 05:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
the committee usually I do it as a
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
handout I won't but it's a winter
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
severity map that shows the the
 
05:38:58.708 --> 05:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
microclimate that is New England and it
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
is unlike any other sectors of the
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
nation so you can't compare us to
 
05:39:04.468 --> 05:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
Florida you have to look at us where
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're in this nuclear red section our
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
our Winters are um are varied and
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're unique and we do things like
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
spray liquid salt water on our roads and
 
05:39:16.590 --> 05:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
drive through them to keep ice off them
 
05:39:18.670 --> 05:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
it has a very very different impact on
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles than it does in Southern
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
California so um I want to keep that in
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
mind that when we're talking about
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples about about other
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
states and that includes the emissions
 
05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
prog programs that we're talking about
 
05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
here when we say oh well Connecticut
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't do emissions testing Connecticut
 
05:39:36.430 --> 05:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
may not do emissions testing except for
 
05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
every four years but emissions
 
05:39:40.670 --> 05:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
reductions and Mr Fitzgerald spoke to
 
05:39:42.590 --> 05:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
this emissions reductions are a piece of
 
05:39:45.150 --> 05:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
a pie right so sometimes it's the heavy
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
trucks and then it's the power
 
05:39:48.670 --> 05:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
generators and the manufacturers and the
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
passenger cars so Connecticut may give a
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
pass to their passenger car Fleet but
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
what are they doing for the rest of them
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
so is there is heavy reductions on um
 
05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
body shops and smoke stacks and and
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
power generators so when we just say one
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
state does an emissions test we have to
 
05:40:10.548 --> 05:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're talking apples to
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
apples and and to that to that point I
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
do I do Wonder um you know um to Mr
 
05:40:18.270 --> 05:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
fitzerald Point as well if they do do
 
05:40:20.910 --> 05:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
that 18 to 24mon process and they go to
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
the EPA and the EPA says um okay well
 
05:40:26.350 --> 05:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
you can exempt the first two model years
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
of Passenger cars um do you think
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
they're going to give the EPA is going
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
to give us a free pass or are they going
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
to say well I want to see reductions in
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
another sector and what sector is going
 
05:40:38.590 --> 05:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
to pick up that piece of the pie or that
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
burden is it going to be the power
 
05:40:42.510 --> 05:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
plants because that raises rates right
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
so we have to be very very careful so
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know it it's kind of like a a shoot
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
first aim second right let's let's see
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
what happens so um I would almost think
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
we I maybe suggest that we wouldn't even
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to change the program until we knew
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we had that that question answered
 
05:41:04.868 --> 05:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
um we run a consumer complete program
 
05:41:07.390 --> 05:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General refers multiple
 
05:41:10.468 --> 05:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
multiple calls to us um not too many but
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
enough over the year about 200 uh it's
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
called autocap and a majority of those
 
05:41:16.910 --> 05:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
calls are all related around confusion
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
with the sale of the vehicle there's no
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
we receive no calls about consumer
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
backlash against the safety in
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
inspection program which is a free
 
05:41:26.708 --> 05:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
market program the state doesn't set the
 
05:41:28.590 --> 05:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
rates if you don't like the price at
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
this place go to that place you can find
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
a cheaper guy on another corner so the
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
program as mentioned we really think it
 
05:41:41.110 --> 05:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
works um the model year in this uh uh
 
05:41:43.628 --> 05:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
bit proposal is a little confusing in in
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
that I mean someone could actually go up
 
05:41:47.708 --> 05:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
to 30 months without an annual safety
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
inspection the model year rollouts the
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
the days of the September reveal where
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a Mustang in the showroom and
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
the carpets removed and then you see the
 
05:41:58.350 --> 05:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
new model those are gone model year
 
05:42:01.628 --> 05:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
rules happen on roll like in in March a
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
2025 could come out so I I'll just
 
05:42:06.070 --> 05:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
pencil this scenario for you my birthday
 
05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
is in January in in July of this summer
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know I buy a 2025 model I'm going
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
to go July to July July to July and July
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
to January till I get that first
 
05:42:21.430 --> 05:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
inspection so I stink at math but I
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
think that's around 30 months right it's
 
05:42:26.110 --> 05:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
a pretty long period before you get your
 
05:42:28.590 --> 05:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
first um inspection look which also
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
means you're likely going to be out of
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
warranty which means the manufacturer
 
05:42:34.590 --> 05:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
won't P pick up the bill the consumer
 
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
will pick up the
 
05:42:38.510 --> 05:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill so another important component of
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
this program too with this annual check
 
05:42:43.110 --> 05:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
is that every time the vehicle is
 
05:42:44.910 --> 05:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
plugged into that Gordon Darby en host
 
05:42:47.548 --> 05:42:47.558 align:start position:0%
unit a safety inspection excuse me a
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
safety inspection recall check is done
 
05:42:52.468 --> 05:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
through a federal database and it
 
05:42:55.468 --> 05:42:55.478 align:start position:0%
provides tremendous value and just some
 
05:42:58.750 --> 05:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
data on that one in model year and that
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
this started in model year 22 that was
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
the first time it happened so for model
 
05:43:05.310 --> 05:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
year 22 in
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
2022 40
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
4,654 recall notices were distributed
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 on model year 22 vehicles
 
05:43:16.400 --> 05:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 on model year 22 vehicles
14,430

05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
14,430
 
05:43:20.110 --> 05:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles received notices that they were
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
under safety recall that hadn't been
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
completed that were given and handed to
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
Consumers same thing in model for model
 
05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
year 23 in 201 22 there were 378 recall
 
05:43:35.230 --> 05:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
notices and in 2023 there was 4531
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
notices of safe open safety recalls were
 
05:43:41.230 --> 05:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
given to um to Consumers to make them
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
aware that their vehicle was under
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
recall they might have missed the little
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
postcard that came in the mail right
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
especially during election season when
 
05:43:51.230 --> 05:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
your mailbox is full of them so this
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
check does the safety inspection recall
 
05:43:56.230 --> 05:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
check for for the the customer the
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
citizen so um and while we're on the
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
topic of data too cuz um I said I was
 
05:44:03.070 --> 05:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to bounce around and I'm sticking
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
to it um the the numbers that you get
 
05:44:06.520 --> 05:44:07.230 align:start position:0%
to it um the the numbers that you get
for

05:44:07.230 --> 05:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
failers is in our opinion and and I
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
think we could probably talk to State
 
05:44:13.110 --> 05:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
Police and D DMV about it for
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
confirmation are are not reflective of
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
what the actual safety failures are
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
because that's a safety failure that got
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
a failure and then walked away and said
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not fixing it it doesn't indicate
 
05:44:28.468 --> 05:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
the safety failure that says it was
 
05:44:28.478 --> 05:44:30.150 align:start position:0%
the safety failure that says it was
corrected

05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
when my vehicle fails for
 
05:44:36.468 --> 05:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
safety my trusted mechanic calls me and
 
05:44:40.590 --> 05:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
says Danny you need new tires and I say
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
Dan please put the tires on I'll
 
05:44:44.110 --> 05:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
purchase some new tires he doesn't then
 
05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
Mark me for a fail and then marks me for
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
a pass he puts the new tires on and
 
05:44:50.468 --> 05:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
marks me for a pass so that failure
 
05:44:53.990 --> 05:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
number is in my opinion it's um it's
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's drastically low or under reported
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
because that's someone who said nah I'm
 
05:45:00.510 --> 05:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to fix the tires myself I'm going
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
to go buy them on the Internet and they
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
walk so it's a it's a in our opinion
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's an underreported number um the the
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill also deals with a licensed dealer
 
05:45:11.468 --> 05:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
question it says from a licensed dealer
 
05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
is that a licensed New Hampshire dealer
 
05:45:14.910 --> 05:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
licensed Mass dealer licensed main
 
05:45:17.990 --> 05:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
dealer that's not clear um what happens
 
05:45:19.948 --> 05:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
when a vehicle a new model your vehicle
 
05:45:22.468 --> 05:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
resells twice in one year from the
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
second buyer of that same model year
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle the way the bill is written that
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
second buyer even though it's in the
 
05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
same model year still does have to have
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
a safety inspection so do we have a
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to do that um to
 
05:45:39.390 --> 05:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
point that out yeah I mean they
 
05:45:41.468 --> 05:45:41.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned the law enforcement uh you
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
know no sticker in the corner of the
 
05:45:44.430 --> 05:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
window this bill doesn't give any
 
05:45:46.230 --> 05:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
direction to come up with a temporary
 
05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
sticker so is State Police going to stop
 
05:45:50.350 --> 05:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
them all or stop
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:45:59.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
I have a bunch of other information you
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
heard about the impact to the state to
 
05:46:06.150 --> 05:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact both the dees uh and
 
05:46:09.670 --> 05:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
the locals and the state government um
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
the funds uh the highway fund takes a
 
05:46:13.310 --> 05:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
hit the general fund and the air
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
pollution abatement fund um so those are
 
05:46:19.150 --> 05:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
things to consider um and then there's
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
just the general concept you know um
 
05:46:23.590 --> 05:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
safety inspections are a really good
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
idea just like an annual an annual
 
05:46:28.110 --> 05:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
physical at your doctor right
 
05:46:30.270 --> 05:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance is a heck of a
 
05:46:33.070 --> 05:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
lot cheaper than catastrophic rep repair
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
we know that and that's what this
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
program does so um with that I'll end my
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll submit a RI copy so that
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
you have all of it I will in fact Supply
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
you the winter severity map that I
 
05:46:48.030 --> 05:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
