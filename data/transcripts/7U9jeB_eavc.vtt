00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody thank you very
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
much for being here this morning I will
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
open our work session on house bills
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
so that I get them all correct house
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
bill is 608 House Bill 238 House Bill
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
317 and House Bill
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
642. all of these bills are related to
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability community
 
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of Developmental services
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
so it seemed prudent to bring all of
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
these here to the table today while we
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
discuss while we discuss this very
 
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 align:start position:0%
important very pressing issue
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
yes I just have a preliminary thing that
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
I just noticed were they all noticed for
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
different times the bills no they were
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
not noticed for different times they're
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
all noticed for nine o'clock as a full
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
committee work okay perfect perfect I
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
just saw something here with things at
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you thank you for
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
checking to make sure that we're doing
 
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
things correctly I appreciate it I'm
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
three steps behind and I'm sorry about
 
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.490 align:start position:0%
three steps behind and I'm sorry about
that

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh so one of our largest challenges as
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with these bills is the
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
looming requirements to become in
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
compliance with some federal
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
requirements surrounding direct billing
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
and around the conflict the
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management this has
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing process where there have
 
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
been waivers already requested
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
um there have been responses including
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
to the governor saying that um that some
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
some options are off the table however
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we can look
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
probe around all of the opportunities
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
and see what we can do to make sure that
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
we're able to proceed in a reasonable
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
way for the state and make sure that
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're also protecting these families in
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
the system that supports them for all of
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
us the last two years almost the last
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
three years have been incredibly
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
challenging and probably even more so
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
for this community so we want to make
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
we don't add more change before they're
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
ready to deal with it
 
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.910 align:start position:0%
ready to deal with it
um

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if anybody has any
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
particular questions that they wanted to
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
ask around these or if I should continue
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
to guide this to look at what the four
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
different bills are and how we would
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at as far as
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
potential amendments and our process
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
um yes the first one is the house bill
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
608 establishing a pilot program to
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
support the Bureau of Developmental
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
Services redesign this is the one that
 
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
Services redesign this is the one that
um

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
that basically stops the process on a
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the things around the a m audit
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
it they are there are some air things
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
that are being included in this process
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
that are not not necessarily required to
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
come into Federal compliance and it's a
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
question one of the questions that I
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
have and that other people have both in
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
the community and in the committee is
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
whether proceeding with all of these at
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
the same time is prudent given that the
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
direct Bill change is so large and so
 
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
direct Bill change is so large and so
significant

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
then there's also House Bill 238
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the role of the quality
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
control and the developmental disability
 
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
service system that one was brought to
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
us by our long-term long time but not
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
this year Committee Member
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
um this is one of those bills that's
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
trying to address the fact that the
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
community did not feel that they had
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
enough of a voice at the table and we
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
need to figure out the right way to make
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody can work together
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
towards the right Solutions as opposed
 
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.290 align:start position:0%
towards the right Solutions as opposed
to

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having a lot of open
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions that hopefully that we can
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
either resolve or recognize has been
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
discussed and that there may be some
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion then there's
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 317 establishing a commission
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
to transitioning to a two-tier waiver
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
system for individuals eligible for
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
disability services
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire everybody is
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
under one tier of waiver one of the ways
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
that this is used is that in some states
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
they have one higher level of waiver
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
that is institutionalized care for very
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
high need families and high need
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
individuals and then there's another one
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
that offers a lower tier of services to
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
people who need supports to stay within
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we do in New
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's really special really
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
beneficial and is also a fiscally
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
responsible is we keep people with their
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
families to a much greater extent than
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
some other states do this is a feature
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure we do not lose
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
with any changes to the redesign because
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
having a supportive system at home with
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
the supports that you need is better for
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the individual better for the community
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
and better for the state especially
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
because we know that institutionalized
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
care can become a problem especially
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
especially the way that it's progressed
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
in the past both here in I don't know
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
the whole history of the Laconia school
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
but I know that there's a reason it was
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
closed around the time I was born and I
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
do know that we have our own history our
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
more recent history with the sununo
 
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:02.899 align:start position:0%
center so
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
institutionalizing should be a last
 
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.410 align:start position:0%
institutionalizing should be a last
resort

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
resort
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
we do need to look at these tiers of
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
waivers and make sure that we're not
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
precluding families from getting care in
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
their family home and that we're not
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
prevent we're not doing anything that
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
will force people into an institution
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
when that is not the right choice for
 
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
when that is not the right choice for
them

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
and finally we have House Bill 642 which
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting the Department of Health
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
and Human Services from enforcing salary
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
caps for direct care workers this is
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
something that is seems to be somewhat
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
related to some settings and Excel
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
Fields but it also is a pressing concern
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
because I've spoken with plenty of
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
people at the area agencies and other
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
providers that the amount that they're
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
able to pay that the Direct Care in the
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
direct care providers is a problem and
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's challenging
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
retention and challenging getting these
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
services for these uh these very
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
important people in our community we
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that any choices we do
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
there aren't setting an obstacle in the
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
path while making sure that we are get
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are making making the correct choices
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
to provide care for it for these very
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
yes I want to get a feel of the room if
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
we want to just dig right into that 608
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
issue or if we want to talk about
 
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
well I'm speaking only for myself here
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
but I'm I I wonder if we wanted to deal
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
with what I see as somewhat low-hanging
 
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.420 align:start position:0%
fruit here the the easy one for me is
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon's Council
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't although it is
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to all of the other
 
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:57.860 align:start position:0%
bills it's not so inextricably wound up
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
um you know the gears are going to grind
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't do it right uh so I see that
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
as being somewhat freestanding I think
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
for me with respect to all the other
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
bills the conversations that I have had
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
with providers in my community not
 
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.650 align:start position:0%
with providers in my community not
families

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.870 align:start position:0%
families
um

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:29.540 align:start position:0%
indicate that the problems are ones that
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
really to me don't necessarily lend
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
themselves to legislative Solutions
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I have in my mind
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
just to throw out here is a possibility
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
would be to perhaps create a
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the Health and Human
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee to watch it
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
month to month to month to month because
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
what they can do is they can bring
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
people in to ask or or just have the
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Commission
 
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.850 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Commission
committee

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:00.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
look at it month to month but a
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could do it more often as
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
to how far have you gotten what are you
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
doing what's happening now because
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
the things that are clear to me is
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's a critical deadline July 1st and
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
most of the people don't know exactly
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
what the guidelines are yet and
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have the software to
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
deal with them even if they did
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
um so you know what what
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
folks are hoping for is another
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
extension but an extension saying look
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
we're not just spinning our Wheels here
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
we have made x amount of progress and we
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to do this right rather than just
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
having a train wreck on July 1st so
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's one side of it
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
the other side that's difficult for me
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that the things with the salary cap I
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
listened to people when they came and
 
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.910 align:start position:0%
listened to people when they came and
testified

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.590 align:start position:0%
testified
and

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
people were very much it was all the
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
same problem people were very much
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
divided about whether this will solve
 
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
the problem so uh that worries me
 
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860 align:start position:0%
because people who were very credible
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
came to very different and who have much
 
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
more experience with the system than I
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
do came to very different conclusions
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
which is a long way of saying I don't
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
know what to do here but but those are
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
the considerations I'm keeping in my
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
mind about concerns that I have going
 
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.689 align:start position:0%
mind about concerns that I have going
forward

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber I
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate your long-standing knowledge
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
of the legislative process and when and
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
we when we should and shouldn't get
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
involved and I do have a very similar
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
read on the salary caps and some of
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
these other issues as well I guess my
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
one question to you with somebody with
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
with long-standing legislative
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
experience is whether it would be
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
helpful for that Health and Human
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee to also
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's proceeding because we
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
do know that by the time that this would
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
be signed into law the deadline will
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
have come and passed for the federal
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
compliance but if having a guide map of
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
what we would like to see and what we
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
would like to have the department move
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
towards would be helpful in guiding that
 
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
towards would be helpful in guiding that
process

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
and I guess my answer to that would be
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
I'd have to I'd have to take a look at
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
it because putting a guiding principle
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
into a statute is not really what a
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
statute is for and why I think of things
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
like the Health and Human Services
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
oversight Community because I think the
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
other thing that we're all very much
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
agreed on is that none of us wants to
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
just kick this can down the road and do
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
nothing for six months because that is
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
also not an option but
 
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.230 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.110 align:start position:0%
um I
[Music]

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
you know I'm one of the things I
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
definitely think about is that one of
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
the bills needs to be retained as a
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle so that if we need to make a
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
quick correction in January we've got it
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.210 align:start position:0%
ready to go
um

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:55.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
or and you know there is of course the
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of quick action on the part
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the legislature but to do that you
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
need very specific buy-in by not only us
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
but also the Senate and the governor so
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I think that that might be one thing
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
that would be prudent to do
 
00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
that would be prudent to do
um

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I don't object to sending something
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
forward what I what I'm concerned about
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
is what it would say at this point and
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
what it would direct people to do
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
because statutes normally do either
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
direct people to do something or forbid
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
them to do something and I'm not sure
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
that we can set out a nuanced
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
set of parameters
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
that I would be comfortable in acting
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
even even if we knew that they were
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to be revised Again by the Senate
 
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
going to be revised Again by the Senate
because

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes the Senate just doesn't do
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.789 align:start position:0%
 
darn

00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
darn
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
so again there's a lot of uncertainty
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
there and I wish I sure wish I had
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
answers but I really don't
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I think that's why
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
we called this work session when
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could be working through
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
that list of bills to exec
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I I do agree that looking at this
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit of Representative
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
McMahon's bill first would be helpful
 
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.890 align:start position:0%
McMahon's bill first would be helpful
um I

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
I do also have one other parallel idea
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
that I do want to toss out there as well
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the the broad drafting
 
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.930 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the the broad drafting
sorry

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
with us you were talking about the
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
two-tier waiver or were you talking
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
about the quality control I may have
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
mixed up my Prime sponsors
 
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.090 align:start position:0%
mixed up my Prime sponsors
um

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
the one that I was talking about with
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
the McMahon bill was the one that would
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
that creates the developmental Services
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
quality Council 238 238 perfect just
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a council it's not
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the council is the one that interacts
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
with the whole system it's not making
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
the system change thank you my confusion
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
was um around creating representative
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I think the council is already
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
there yes it's really
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
um being more specific about how the
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
council will be
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
interact with the process of change
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
in DHHS thank you yes
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
um we had another bill about giving a
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a roll call vote to an
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
advisory Council in another bill and my
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
my question would be would giving an
 
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.409 align:start position:0%
my question would be would giving an
advice

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
advice
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
giving this quality Council the
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a roll call vote on
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
rules before they go to jailcar and to
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
have that vote be transmitted to gel car
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
be something that is helpful and would
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
that address the necessity to be
 
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:48.980 align:start position:0%
involved and be heard
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
that is an open question that's the
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
issue may be a lot deeper than simply a
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
yes or no vote on a proposed on a final
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
rule before it goes to gel car but I
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
thought that that was the most simple
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
solution that we might offer and I
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be up be a good
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I would like to yes we have another
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Shapiro well I
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know representative McMahon actually
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
brought the the um amendment that we
 
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.210 align:start position:0%
brought the the um amendment that we
have

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.110 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
so he can probably talk better about it
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
than I but I was involved also and I
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
think it's broader than just the vote on
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
rules it's really uh you know it's
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
really involvement in a variety of ways
 
00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
really involvement in a variety of ways
in

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.190 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
giving input for change including you
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
know the bidding process which some
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
people said was a problem for
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
contractors but I think
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's broader than just that so I think
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
we should not forego this Bill thank you
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
very much I think that that's a very
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
good point and I actually would like to
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
invite representative McMahon up if
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
you'd like to join with us in the
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill and the
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
amendment uh because you've been so
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
involved in this whole process I'd like
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
to include you in this work session as
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
we try to figure out how to address this
 
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
challenge so
 
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.090 align:start position:0%
challenge so
[Laughter]

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
we'll have you said over there we should
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll turn that on
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay you must still give a well just one
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
comment if I may uh in working for with
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
Cooperative collaboration to achieve
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
consensus is the goal here and not to uh
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
set a new a separate Target that would
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
be in conflict with our Department of
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services in providing
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
the office not the oversight but in
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
carrying out this this very important
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
work to our citizens in the state
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the the quality Council was
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
established years ago uh because and I'm
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
just reading from uh it's if still have
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment that was
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
presented when this bill was offered to
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
you on the 15th of February February I
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe it is as I recall
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
um it was for systemic review and
 
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.510 align:start position:0%
um it was for systemic review and
Improvement

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the various services and that's to
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
have a functional participation in the
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance and my word Improvement of
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
where we are on on that given day and
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
how we move forward
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
so that's what uh has was not taking
 
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.890 align:start position:0%
so that's what uh has was not taking
place

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
as uh as in here to have a functional in
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
writing uh description of what the the
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
quality the service Quality Service
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
Council uh would be doing when they
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
carry out their work
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why this was offered
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
to you it's the again Cooperative
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
collaboration is the bottom line but
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's to meet the services that those who
 
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
are part of the
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic process and qualifying for
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
your the waivers and how they're
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
submitted is that then there's a
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
fundamental um
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
commitment to then meet what you have
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
were part of supporting uh in in the
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
field and that's
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
was that's the motivation for this and
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
that's we're asking
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
for a positive recommendation from the
 
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
committee on on this effort
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you that's actually very helpful
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that the approval on
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
rulemaking would be enough or do you
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
think that all of these changes would be
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
necessary for the community to feel
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
appropriately involved and heard uh the
 
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.190 align:start position:0%
appropriately involved and heard uh the
latter

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
latter
 
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
it's not the these
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
these improvements wouldn't say they're
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
changes only because I think that the
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
intent is there it's now it's when their
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh the membership can change uh not
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
can't does change it's everyone knowing
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
what's the rules of how to win in this
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
effort and not having a learning curve
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
and that then extends the time for a
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
resolution of of the challenge at hand
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
now one um things that we worked on the
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the past uh the member with member
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
McKay and the Pats as well as is
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
providing the the appropriate services
 
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.250 align:start position:0%
providing the the appropriate services
with

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
families to maintain home and
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
community-based Care in New Hampshire
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm biased I have a believer
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire leads the nation in
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
that because we believe in
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
self-responsibility self-respect and
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
self-determination and we carry it out
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
by actually doing it
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's not to have it separated by a
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic wall to say okay now I'll
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
decide after I've
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
um not high but I mean an entity will
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
decide we need full open concept
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
um communication
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
because the commitment after the fact is
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
is where that challenge is and we can't
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
have uh in again my comment we can't
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
have families uh leaving this
 
00:25:53.409 --> 00:25:53.419 align:start position:0%
responsibility and having the
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
institutionalization of individuals not
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
just the disability but are aggressively
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
mature as I say Elder Elders uh when
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
they need when they can be have Services
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
provided in the in the home and that has
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
is has happened in New Hampshire and we
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
can continue to improve that and um and
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm and again my in the interest of
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
disclosure I lived a life I have a
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
civilian handicapped son we do it at
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
home ourselves and uh
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and it does and working with the state
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the tremendous
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
resources we have in our Personnel uh it
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
it is an added value this is to ensure
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
that the work they do that the citizens
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
of being a part of the process have that
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
commitment to meet what they said
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
they needed and that the solution is
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
what they all agree to
 
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:52.010 align:start position:0%
what they all agree to
foreign

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be helpful to pass
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
for those of us who do need it are we
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
speaking zero four nine one
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
hey yes ma'am okay a representative yes
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
yeah apologize for that I I miss some I
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
thought you'd still have the copies I
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
should know better
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
how many documents you must handle some
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
of us have them some of them have them
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
us have them electronically but it's a
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
lot easier to make notes on them when
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're discussing them right now yeah
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh Shapiro can I just say
 
00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
that when I went up to pick up those
 
00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
that when I went up to pick up those
amendments

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
um on the fourth floor they had another
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment for on House Bill 238 but the
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
the woman up there said she didn't have
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
any idea whose Amendment it was but it's
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
printed so if anybody else
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
that that was my attempt at a potential
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
rules change so that we would have that
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
as something to look at if it was of
 
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
interest thank you
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if we could talk a
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about the the issue I mean it
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
real nub here is uh page two lines 26 to
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
29 so the significant changes proposed
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
relating to or may impact the practice
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
of policy standards rates budgets
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
funding formula or rights
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's the concern in a NAB and
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
then the question of
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh how to participate in the contract
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
and bidding process sounded to me from
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
the testimony like it was a little bit
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
more problematical both from the point
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
of view of potential conflicts of
 
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.250 align:start position:0%
of view of potential conflicts of
interests

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
and from the point of view of how long
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
is this process going to take because
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
the last thing we want to do is add more
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
time to an already
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
lengthy and and involved process so I
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
guess I guess for me I'm I'm very happy
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
with the addition of number three on 27
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
to 30. but I wonder if we need to talk a
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more about section four which
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
is the bidding
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
the bidding process
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you that actually is one of
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
those areas that the department had had
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
brought up some significant concerns
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
around and knowing that
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that while we have while it's a
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
relatively large community it's a small
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
community as well yeah and if we have
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
people who are involved that are
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
precluded from offering Services because
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're part of a non-disclosure
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
agreement and a non-compete where they
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
can't participate in them
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
um I I personally question whether
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
that's going to end up serving the
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
interests more because if you're working
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
on the consulting or service contract
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
and then maybe up to up to bid on that
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
that that presents a lot of different
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
challenges and potentials for conflict
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
microphone please I know that the two
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
issues here are um
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
from my experience with the dental bill
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
last year when I called to inquire about
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
how the bidding was going I was told we
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
can't tell you anything because it's a
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
totally confidential process and if if
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
if it gets messed up we have to start
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
all over from scratch on the other hand
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
I know that the this bill was written
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
and parked because there was a contract
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
written with this Consulting
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
organization and the council felt that
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
they had no impact no
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
input into how that was done
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether it was done who it was done with
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
and so there's kind of competing
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
um elements here
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
part of what drove this bill is that
 
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
they very much want to have some input
 
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.289 align:start position:0%
they very much want to have some input
into

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
if another contract is created how it's
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
created with who it's created so I don't
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
know how we solved the problem but I
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
think that those are the two aspects of
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
my suggestion for drafting would be
 
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
to take to keep
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
the standard in in free which which
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
really talks about any changes coming up
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
they they get to comment on and keeping
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement on page three that when
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the council has concerns the department
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
must respond in writing to those
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
concerns so that gets us part way to
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
being able to express a concern and
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
having a response to a concern if we
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
would people then be
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable taking out
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
the paragraph four about the bidding
 
00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:56.539 align:start position:0%
contracts and
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable enough with what was
 
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.149 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable enough with what was
left

00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
and that that that may not be as much as
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
people want in terms of involvement with
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
the bidding process but the bidding
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
process being as it is
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that we create as Madam
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
chair said more problems than we
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you that that is a one point one
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the others I I wonder if there's a
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
way to carve out those where we're
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
Contracting with
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
out-of-state consulting services or if
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's really trying to address a horse
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's already out in the field and if
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit too late to bring
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
I guess representative McMahon do you
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
have a feel on whether it would be on
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are about leaving
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
that section 4 out
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh yeah well yes and I respect my my
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
colleague Madam Weber I was called but
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh on the issues is
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
uh I have the same uh concerns in terms
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
of uh if there's an inherent conflict of
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
interest uh and so on and that would not
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
be a person who would uh that's it's
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
requiring not requiring requesting that
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
a council member be included is in part
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
of the process and that's that's um line
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
36 on page two
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the the intent the intent
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
here is to be part of the process and
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
not that again not having a conflict of
 
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:35.509 align:start position:0%
not that again not having a conflict of
interest

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh but being participatory so that the
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
the issues of the reason that the
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
quality console was put together was and
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
with a substantial membership as you see
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
out there is that the interests are
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
spoken for when the contract then is is
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
promulgated and so that's why that's
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's there it's not circumventing not
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
to circumvent what the department is uh
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
needs to deal with when when they uh are
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
choosing but it's to be part of the
 
00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:08.060 align:start position:0%
criteria of the choice
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
because ultimately I mean one it's one
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
person on this
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
this this effort from the from the
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
council as you know that's not a
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
majority it's not uh it's it's still the
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
department that would uh be made
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately makes the decision but it's
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
but uh it's ensuring what did not take
 
00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:26.750 align:start position:0%
but uh it's ensuring what did not take
place

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
with the choice of Alvarez and Marcel
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
there was no participation at all and uh
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
and whatever criteria that was done was
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
was not contributed to by the quality
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
Council which by the intent was to
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
ensure these the quality and service was
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
is being as being met
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
um uh as far as the goal so that's
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I offer some reason keep
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
that in I could modify the drafting
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
suggestion that I think might fix that
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
if we kept four
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
and we kept a which would be confer and
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
receive input from the Council on
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions to be included in a request
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
for proposal which is item a and we kept
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
and we took out B which is including the
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
council member to be part of the
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
selection process because that's where
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:22.690 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:22.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
kept see
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
because C talks about what the
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
contractor is going to do after they are
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
selected and it's getting input
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
from the council once the contractor is
 
00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:39.230 align:start position:0%
from the council once the contractor is
selected

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
selected
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
and that way we keep the council out of
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
the stickier processes of the beginning
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
process but get them more specifically
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
involved at the beginning and after the
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
selection has been made
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
with that work for people as a
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
possibility representative Cushman
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to say that I
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
had the exact same thoughts so thank you
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
for mentioning that I think that that is
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
a good compromise for that section
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I would second
 
00:36:13.569 --> 00:36:13.579 align:start position:0%
that is a good solution and also
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
considering that the Senate will hear
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
this bill also and there'll be people
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
from DHHS here there at that when
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're considering it and if it has to
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
be tweaked a little bit more to make
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
sure there's no conflict it can be done
 
00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:31.370 align:start position:0%
sure there's no conflict it can be done
then

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very good point I know
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the department will be very
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
does it look like with removing section
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
B which is lines 36 and 37 on page two
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
we have something that we feel
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable sending to the senate for
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
um off to the Senate yeah I'd be happy
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
with that if we just got that one
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
is there any anybody else who wants has
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
an opinion here fantastic I think oh
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Cushman
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
I can't find word oh um just the the
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
exception to 91a still I don't support
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
changing what constitutes a quorum I
 
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
changing what constitutes a quorum I
understand

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
understand
um

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.750 align:start position:0%
you know
the

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
um our current law has been found by the
 
00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:27.500 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to you know comply with
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws and
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I think that we should keep
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
Quorum as it is in 91a so that's section
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
seven that's my only objection to the
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
bill now
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much representative
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
Cushman that does bring up a very
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
important Point especially because as we
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
know being in a room together it's a
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
little easier to work through some of
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
the issues but we also it also would be
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that that people
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
can be involved especially if they're
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
going through a particularly challenging
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
situation they don't have the care
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to get to the meeting
 
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.970 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to get to the meeting
representative

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I had another bill in another
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
committee 306 or 308 I'm sorry about
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
Quorum and remote meeting that it passed
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
through the committee and it passed
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
through the house
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
so uh if that passes through the Senate
 
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
and gets signed it allowed a third of
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
the group had to be in a location and
 
00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:25.579 align:start position:0%
other people could
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
zoom in and create a quorum that way but
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
it did have that it had to be in a
 
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
specific location with a third of the
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
membership present so
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
that may take care of itself thank you
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and and that has
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
certainly happened with any number of
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
bodies including
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
performance oversight where somebody
 
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
tucked into a budget Bill
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
a reduction of the quorum to one-third
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
of the members being present there was
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
with that no provision for a remote
 
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:03.500 align:start position:0%
access but I think that but we have
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
in the context of legislative work and I
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't normally like them but I think
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
that for this population this is a good
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
compromise between having people in the
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
room but also making sure that the
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
population served who may not be able to
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
get to the room are also included in the
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
process so we have other legislative
 
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:33.140 align:start position:0%
precedent for reducing quorums down to
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
levels that I'm not comfortable with but
 
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
levels that I'm not comfortable with but
um

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
does it requires the actual half plus
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
one Quorum which I'd rather keep and I
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
think that we're all agreed we want to
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
keep but it allows for making up that
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
Quorum uh with people who may not be
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
able to physically get into the room and
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
I think that that's a a very important
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
point with this population if we're
 
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:04.940 align:start position:0%
going to be inclusive of the service
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
recipients rather than uh their
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
caregiver I mean their caregivers are
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
great proxies and an important voice but
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
we also want service recipients included
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you that is a great point my
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
question would be if we were to amend
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
this section
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
um now section seven to keep the
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
language that says convened by the chair
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
or vice chair of the council because we
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave it to only be
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
convened by the commissioner of the
 
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.710 align:start position:0%
convened by the commissioner of the
department

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
or their designee and perhaps leave the
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
existing language I don't know if the
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
correct wording would be notwithstanding
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
other statutes
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
um no the what's here is fine because
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's for the purpose of convening with
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
91a we're making an exception here
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I think the exception should be here
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
rather than in 91a because nobody's
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
going to look to 91a for that so I I'd
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
leave the I my preference would be to
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
leave this section exactly as it has
 
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:07.700 align:start position:0%
been drafted
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
my one remaining question would be that
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
if we already have that in the 91a if
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're if we're echoing it through other
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
areas whether that creates more
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
confusion or less if we have a new
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
standard it
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
the ability of 91a to convert create
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
confusion is Legion and various
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
legislative committees have dealt with
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
91a in very different ways in very
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
different places in the statute so if we
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
contribute our little might to Greater
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
confusion but also greater access for a
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
population who needs it I'm real
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that because I think we
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
have met the spirit of 91a which is
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
requiring a quorum and requiring a forum
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
for votes and requiring a place for
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
people to come and then we have a way
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
for people to provide their in input
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and and and it is limited to members
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
who are not able to be physically
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
present either due to their disabilities
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
or the disability of a family member
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that you can join from
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
your vacation on your cruise ship that
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
has Wi-Fi
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so I think that we're making a very
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
specific and very narrow accommodation
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
which I think we're probably required to
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
make under the Ada anyway
 
00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:31.190 align:start position:0%
make under the Ada anyway
um so

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that that is useful in this
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
case and I think we want to have it
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
right there in the place where
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
the rules of the council are lodged
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
rather than somewhere else in the
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
statute thank you that's very helpful if
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
we end up having some remaining dissent
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
within that that's the sort of thing
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
that can be handled as one of those side
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
notes as we move this through the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee process but thank you I think
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
other than uh potentially just looking
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
at that language I think we're good with
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
this one if we get that redrafted to
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
remove section B
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
I would just offer to have it redrafted
 
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.710 align:start position:0%
I would just offer to have it redrafted
if

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:12.380 align:start position:0%
um you wish
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful thank you
 
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.589 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful thank you
lovely

00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
no representative pulse off uh I just
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
want to ask if representative Cushman
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
has any
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
those objections to the changes in in
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have any further objections
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
spell should we try to get this for this
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon if they could get it for this
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon then I think this should be a
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
very quick vote so that would be very
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
helpful okay thank you
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
they have been very resistant to Quick
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
turnarounds even when it's just excising
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
something very small so oh yeah good
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
luck their whole system around it is
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
very complex so one chain still is
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
embedded in a very large process so we
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
can be hopeful but we won't we won't
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
um oh here yes please that would be
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.309 align:start position:0%
yeah
fantastic

00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:35.630 align:start position:0%
fantastic
um I

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
so that one looks like we have had some
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
good success there
 
00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:40.849 align:start position:0%
good success there
um

00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
I guess we'll look at the uh I'll sit on
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we are all set on that one if
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with that would you
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
like your name on that Amendment too oh
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
please if you could add representative
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
McMahon to it as well please and what
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
I'll do do I mean the collaboration with
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
the authority having jurisdiction over
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
here uh is I I will bring that myself
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
right over to them now and and to see
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
how quickly I can
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
maybe aggressively motivate a quick
 
00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.510 align:start position:0%
maybe aggressively motivate a quick
response

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
so you can so you could have it
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
immediately you can be persuasive so
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful thank you
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's my it's my uh confused the
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
Snowman days the working copy has to
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
come back to me because it's my only
 
00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:21.109 align:start position:0%
come back to me because it's my only
copy

00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
I have other copies for you right here
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.390 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'll get on in the media and advice
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you committee thank you
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you very much
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you I guess now we'll talk
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 642 which is the salary
 
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.250 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 642 which is the salary
caps

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
caps
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if this one maybe our
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
correct Bill to retain because we're not
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure really about the correct process on
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
this and if we do want to have a vehicle
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
in our pocket for January this might be
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
the right path I'm just curious if
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's any anybody who disagrees with
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
that path or wants to discuss it further
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
this is uh the house bill 642 is the
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting the department
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
from enforcing salary caps for direct
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for whatever it's
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
worth I will just say that I got stopped
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the hallway and said I don't
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
understand what your committee is doing
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
because everyone agreed on these bills
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
when uh seemed to agree on these bills
 
00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
when uh seemed to agree on these bills
um

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
when the hearings happened so I I don't
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
know if you want to invite other
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
comments or not that's completely up to
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
you oh yes if there's other comment I I
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely welcome that
 
00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:40.339 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Weber
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say that what I
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
heard was that everybody with that bill
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
specifically the salary cap bill
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and I'm having trouble finding the
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
copy that I took notes on but my
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
recollection was that everybody was
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
concerned about it but about half the
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
people affected said that they really
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanted this because things were bad and
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
half the people said they didn't want it
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
because things were bad and they were
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
afraid it would make it worse
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
so you know I'd be glad to hear
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
other comments oh thank you I think
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion back and forth
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
on that and a lot of this was around
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
putting those Protections in place but
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
currently there is no cap on these
 
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
currently there is no cap on these
um

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
and Our intention would be
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
to through the Health and Human Services
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to make sure that
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
they're not that the department isn't
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
engaging in any practices that will put
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
a cap on it going forward in these
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking processes representative
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I have no opinion about this but
 
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.370 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I have no opinion about this but
um

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
I think the person was talking about the
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
all three of the additional bills rather
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
than just one of them but oh thank you
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
so it's your your decision about whether
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
to let other people speak or not thank
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
you I do think that having a vehicle to
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
retain this um like
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that having salary caps
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
in rules would be consistent with the
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislation that's already in place and
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
that is an objection that I would raise
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
and gel car when the rules come through
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
so holding on to this while knowing that
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
we currently don't have them and there's
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
nothing that enables those salary caps
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I think would give us protection at
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
least through January in order to make
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
sure that salary caps are not enacted
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
before then and if necessary we can come
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
back with this
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel so by holding you
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
mean retaining yes retaining this
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
potentially we don't need to make a
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
definite decision on this right now but
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
but that that seems like that might be a
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
good process that would allow us to move
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
other other portions further further
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative McLean no okay I just
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
think no I agree this is a great Bill uh
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
to retain I think everybody say hey this
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
has to be a way to modify these budgets
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
but what's the best way to do it so and
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think I think the only ones we have to
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
for sure get done because of the
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
compliance issues are 608 and 317 right
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
so those are the only two of this group
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
we have to absolutely get done
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
um 317 actually is not part of the
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
federal compliance so that was something
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
where there is more time this the
 
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.970 align:start position:0%
where there is more time this the
intention

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
intention
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
the intention with that is to make sure
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
that they're involved in that process
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
and creating a new committee so if we
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to talk about 317 next yeah I would
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
favor retaining 642. okay fantastic
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I think that um I think
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're probably in favor of retaining 642
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that's helpful
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
can't take action on that for another
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
um looking at the waiver system
 
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.030 align:start position:0%
um looking at the waiver system
um

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
three House Bill 317 this is about
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
creating a commission to study this
 
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.130 align:start position:0%
creating a commission to study this
process

00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
um my question would be
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult very complex
 
00:50:02.819 --> 00:50:05.089 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult very complex
situation

00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
situation
um

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
whether this makes sense to then move
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
this forward so that this is continuing
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's one of those areas where there's
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
clearly a focus about having involvement
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
my reading of the equality Council would
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
show that they have the opportunity to
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
be involved in this discussion and this
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
planning I'm not sure if having a
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
separate commission makes more sense
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
than having this be part of the work of
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
the quality Council but I personally
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
find it to be an important topic to
 
00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.710 align:start position:0%
find it to be an important topic to
discuss

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
I know we're not supposed to send on
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
notional bills but I know this is
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed I'm
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
not sure if a commission is correct but
 
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.650 align:start position:0%
not sure if a commission is correct but
but

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
if the Senate believes if if the Senate
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
believes that it should be part of the
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
quality Council perhaps then it would be
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
addressed that way or that this is taken
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
up through oversight or already within
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
the the bounds of the quality Council
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
and their current power to do so so I'm
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
curious about any comments on that
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
yeah as I was looking at this my thought
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
and and I remember thinking this the day
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
we were hearing these bills is that
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's so much going on that maybe this
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
should just be left left in the
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
background for now and and the quality
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
Council can take it up but not not start
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
a separate thing where people are trying
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
to figure this out before they even know
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
how the rest of everything's going to go
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so just sort of saying you know
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
bring this back after the dust is
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
settled from the major changes that are
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
going to start well sometime after July
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
1st I thought that was just my thought
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so your thought would be to
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
retain this so that we can see what's
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
necessary moving forward
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
other thing that I have in my notes
 
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.430 align:start position:0%
other thing that I have in my notes
is

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
um somebody's comment
 
00:51:58.079 --> 00:52:00.290 align:start position:0%
um somebody's comment
about

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.030 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
not looking at the wrong button bucket
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
and the the service plan
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
I think that I think there's a huge
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
concern about the two-tier
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
stuff because we have currently a plan
 
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:24.380 align:start position:0%
that for all its faults
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
has an enormous amount of elasticity in
 
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.849 align:start position:0%
has an enormous amount of elasticity in
it

00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
and yes it's it's elasticity of too
 
00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:34.339 align:start position:0%
little resources
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
and too few workers to help and it's got
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
lots of problems
 
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.630 align:start position:0%
lots of problems
but

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
I think that the sense I was getting is
 
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:48.260 align:start position:0%
that people are very
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.210 align:start position:0%
concerned about
um

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
well this all goes back to the a m
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
report that people are very upset about
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
but uh the tears are something that I
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
think in that report was was
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
particularly troubling to people so I I
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
think that that was less I mean
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong the sense
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
that I got that was less the uh wanting
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
to transition to two-tier system and
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
um how to how to do that than wanting to
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
be sure that either we didn't do it or
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we did it with the least harm
 
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.609 align:start position:0%
that we did it with the least harm
possible

00:53:27.609 --> 00:53:27.619 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
so and I'm not sure that
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's somebody out there who
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
can help me with this that you know
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
whether whether or not this transition
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
is something that might be happening in
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the next six months would be very much
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
determinative to me about what we did
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm representative Nagle and
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
then yeah my my recollection of this was
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
quite profound that the consumers
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
did not like this system at all
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
and I understand that a counselor a
 
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:00.980 align:start position:0%
committee or whatever
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
it may come to a decision that's a
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
rotten idea but it's clear that the
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Palmer yeah and
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
I was just saying my experience with
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
buckets both in the school system and I
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
was a on the school board and also
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's a system in Vermont that with
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that you can have some home
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
services or not and almost always people
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
don't fit in the right bucket and you're
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
stuck and they don't their only
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
alternative is to go to a nursing home
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
because they don't quite tick off all
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
the boxes so I kind of hate that that
 
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.770 align:start position:0%
the boxes so I kind of hate that that
approach

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
I do see this also stemming from the
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
consultant report and everything that is
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
moving forward from that
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that's actually part of why I thought
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
it made sense to include these three
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
bills in this work session because it's
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
608 sort of seems to be the Super bill
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
that deals with this and that would put
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
a pause on the two-tier waiver system
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
along with anything else that is not
 
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
part of that so my question would be if
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
we would retain this and then look to
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
put a pause on the two-tier system until
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
after the other Federal compliance is
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
done through House Bill 608 so that we
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
don't start adding huge system changes
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
in while we're still trying to deal with
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
a direct bill and the conflict-free case
 
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
management of course the other side of
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
this is when you're already redesigning
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
it to make it work with account for the
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
free case management are you going to
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
build a system that's then going to get
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
torn down in order to revise it again so
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
we're a bit you know trying to figure
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
out which one's the chicken which one is
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
the egg but without a waiver we're left
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with the reality on the ground
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any other
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
comments on this one
 
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
comments on this one
foreign

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
would be specifically what are you
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
proposing because I
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
um I I too am stuck in the Chicken and
 
00:55:59.930 --> 00:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
the Egg problem and it's not a problem
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure I see us
 
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:05.540 align:start position:0%
being able to deal with effectively
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
legislatively uh both because of the
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
timelines involved because uh something
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
has to happen by July and and
 
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.790 align:start position:0%
has to happen by July and and
um

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's anybody here who
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
could talk to waiver issues or or
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I I'd love to
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
hear it because that's that's what I was
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
hearing from the people who have talked
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
to me outside of the committee
 
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.430 align:start position:0%
to me outside of the committee
um

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impossibility of their
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
being able to be up and running with
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
something that's going to work on July
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
1st so and and
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
I would love
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
to hear about that more fantastic thank
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you for being here
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
and being able to help us out with some
 
00:56:59.809 --> 00:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
insight yes thank you so much for having
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
me I'm Melissa Hardy I'm the director
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
for the division of long-term supports
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
and services which the Bureau of
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services is a part of
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
so specifically to this bill here
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
um it is not part of any compliance date
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
for the 7-1 compliance for CMS so this
 
00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:19.490 align:start position:0%
for the 7-1 compliance for CMS so this
was

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
um like you said a recommendation from
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
the a m report
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
um that the state look at a two-tiered
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
waiver system
 
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
we heard from our stakeholders early
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
last year that you know there were
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about that process
 
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:38.300 align:start position:0%
and so we as the department
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
decided to put a pause on any
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
development as it relates to the
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
two-tier system so we can focus on the
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
federal requirements of direct Bill and
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest we have not picked
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
any work up as as it relates to the
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
two-tier system we haven't looked at it
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
since we put it on pause I believe in
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
may we don't have any plans of picking
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
it up anytime soon because of all of our
 
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.329 align:start position:0%
it up anytime soon because of all of our
um

00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
work with being in compliance with CMS
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
and certainly if it was part of a
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
discussion that we were going to move
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
forward we would engage our stakeholder
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
groups like we're doing with our other
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
pieces of the redesign so having the
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
area agencies providers individuals and
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
families be able to speak with us and
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
tell us does this make sense for New
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's families or not
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Weber so my
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
question would be because we've now
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
moved on to 608 which is the pilot
 
00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:37.010 align:start position:0%
moved on to 608 which is the pilot
program

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.710 align:start position:0%
program
um

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
how does the pilot program help or not
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
help the compliance issue
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
I would say the pilot program is post's
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
compliance issue so things that we would
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
pilot would be after our compliance
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
statement with direct Bill and
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management so things
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
were currently developing new rates for
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
Service delivery we're developing new
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
waiver services in our waiver and all of
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
that work would be part of what we would
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
recommend at least as part of that pilot
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
but I guess maybe maybe this just isn't
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation so I'll hold
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
it till Friday at Health and Human
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
Services oversight but
 
00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
Services oversight but
um

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
I got the sense that what we were trying
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:43.549 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
help well was was to ensure that as we
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
were complying we were also not creating
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
more more problems or Worse system
 
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.450 align:start position:0%
more more problems or Worse system
um

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.190 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
If This Were Bill were to pass as it is
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
or slightly amended uh would it get in
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
of the work that needs to be done before
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
July 1st let's let's start out that way
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
I believe so because of the bandwidth
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
that we have at the department in our
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
tight time frames to meet those two
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance issues that this is
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
not part of that compliance piece of our
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
work so it wouldn't be
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
um necessary to do
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and I I also believe that part of
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
this bill or this two-tier
 
01:00:34.619 --> 01:00:35.569 align:start position:0%
this bill or this two-tier
um

01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a m could be part of
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
either the piloting process in 608 or
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
do you believe will the compliance be in
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
place on July 1st and would be getting
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
this after that date of July 1st makes
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
sense so that once that compliance is in
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
place then there could be a turn and
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
focus to this issue yeah even after
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the compliance on 7-1 there's a lot
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
of steps that we would need to do in
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that compliance is
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
rolled out correctly so I think even if
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
this was on the agenda it would be far
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
down the line after 7-1 it's not
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
something that we're actively focusing
 
01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:18.770 align:start position:0%
something that we're actively focusing
on

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of what time frame
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't even think we would pick
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
it up until earliest 2024.
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
they feel that's helpful representative
 
01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.609 align:start position:0%
they feel that's helpful representative
McLean

01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on the two-tier
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
system I mean we heard a lot about the
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
elasticity of the current system and a
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
lot of opposition from people to it so
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
what was the main driver in the a m
 
01:01:43.319 --> 01:01:44.390 align:start position:0%
what was the main driver in the a m
report

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
um that said you know you should go to
 
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.510 align:start position:0%
um that said you know you should go to
this

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
um for in the a m report it talked about
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
people with different levels of service
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
need so creating a two-tiered system for
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
folks that have lesser needs that cost
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
less would be on one waiver
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um and then our one tier and then people
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
who have more complex medical behavioral
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
health or need a higher level of care
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be on the second waiver
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
yes or tier so so I understand that part
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know but
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
um could that not be done within the
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
existing frame because there's a certain
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
amount of elasticity that you give up by
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
going to this yeah that's what we're
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
doing so right now that's what we do we
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
have the one waiver where folks um uh
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
are all on who who receive developmental
 
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
Services I think the other piece in the
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
a m report that you'll see is that they
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
suggested people on the lesser of the
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
tier and I'm not saying lesser needing
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
lesser Services would could possibly
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
have a cap on those services so I think
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
that was from families and individuals
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
if you're on a lower tier your budget or
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
you would be capped at a at a at a rate
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
or an overall budget and I think that
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
was the a major concern from families
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
with that suggestion from a m
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and appendix B of the research
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
provided by Christina jayer actually has
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of information on that background
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
I had help knowing that it starts at
 
01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
page 17.
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
um are there yes representative Nagel
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
um am I supposed to say thanks for
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's more of a
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
discussion because it's a work session
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to thank me okay anyways
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
I made it quite clear at the hearing I'm
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
not a big fan of a two-tier system I I
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
deal with Shades of Gray and I'm really
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
concerned about that but at the same
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
point um you know Consultants come up
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
with ideas not out of thin air there's
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
other places that have experience with
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
using this kind of system and I'm just
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if a commission
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
what would be the best way to look at
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
how other states other counties other
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
whatevers have used that kind of system
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
would it be in a commission or would it
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
be through already existing ways of
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
looking at decide whether that kind of
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
system has any value for us at all
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a great question I think
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
part of the a m report looked at other
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
states and how they have different tiers
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
and waivers now I'm not saying that's
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
the way New Hampshire should go or not
 
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.190 align:start position:0%
the way New Hampshire should go or not
so

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
um just I think hearing the the
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
concerns and questions from families
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that we should address
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
before we consider
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
implementing any sort of two-tiered
 
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.089 align:start position:0%
implementing any sort of two-tiered
system

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.589 align:start position:0%
system
thanks

01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative co-fault sorry this
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
long table makes it hard
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be clear that I
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
understand so the so the bill is written
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
essentially would put a put a hold on
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
the current project and said say do do
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
this pilot project instead starting July
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
1st 2023
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
um am I am I understanding that
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
correctly or am I missing I'm not sure
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about 608 or three
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
seven I'm sorry we're still well I guess
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
um we're still sort of blending that
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
area yeah 2017. it seems to me might
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
prohibit um proceeding until there's
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
until this Council has a recommendation
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
um okay and I think 608 does as well so
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
I actually was asking about the language
 
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
in 608
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
um but the but the idea of a so so did I
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
misunderstand when you said sort of
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
doing a pilot program would be deferred
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's something that you really would
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
not be able to get to doing until 2024.
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah as we're focusing on our
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with CMS those are the direct
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
Bill and conflict-free case management
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
are a rail to
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
um work streams right now
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
um so anything that really isn't related
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
to those things are in the future and
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
would be part of the 608 pilot okay yeah
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
I guess my my concern is just to Echo
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
what representative Nagel said is that
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
there's there's a general sense that the
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
system isn't working for people and
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:05:58.559 --> 01:05:59.450 align:start position:0%
there's a
um

01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's a sense among people in the DD
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
community that
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
their voices are not necessarily being
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
heard and I think that's what I'm
 
01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
grappling with I think it's a lot of
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
what a lot of people here are grappling
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
with is what is the appropriate way
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
forward to make sure that that happens
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess I'm I'm open to to
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
hearing suggestions as to how how that
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
could proceed I mean the the previous
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill that we just sent off an amendment
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
for I think would
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
increase stakeholder involvement and
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that there are some voices being
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
heard but that's the general concern I
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
think that that Echoes through all of
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
these bills and how do we make sure that
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
those people have a voice and
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I mean with with many of these
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
systems it's it's sort of necessarily A
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
top-down design process and that that
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
isn't anybody's fault it's just you know
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's we're dealing with large
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
complex systems that are applied across
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
a large population and nevertheless that
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
that's the that's what we're struggling
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
with so
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm I'm open to hearing
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
suggestions as to how that could how
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
that stakeholder engagement could be
 
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.809 align:start position:0%
that stakeholder engagement could be
improved

01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
so I think as the department we've been
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
really taking an active role in going
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
out into the community to talk to
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
individuals and families about their
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
concerns and we heard we hear them
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
um uh so I think you know I think we've
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
had over 200 different stakeholders
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
whether that stakeholder engagements
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's with individuals and
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
families with providers with area
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
agencies so we can be transparent with
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this work and have them be a part of the
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
redesign process since it is their daily
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
lives and so you know I think again
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
where the concern is is that we have two
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements that we have to
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
meet by seven one or are funding could
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
our federal funding could be at risk and
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
then the other recommendations that were
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
in the a m
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
report could be piloted could be
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
discussed after you know that 7-1
 
01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
discussed after you know that 7-1
deadline

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
I'm now back to really basic question
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
which is I'm I'm reading in 608 uh the
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
first paragraph
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
and it says the commissioner shall not
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
Implement a BDS redesign prior to July
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
1st 2024. so that
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
prohibits something happening
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
are the two things that we need to do by
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
July 1st not part of the BDS redesign
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
are they not part of the total redesign
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
and if we say we're not going to do any
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
redesign until 2024 are we not
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
shutting down the work that has to be
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
done by July 1st and I think that's the
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
Department's concern with the language
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
in 608 because the a m report and we had
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
suggested and provided some
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
some suggested language for kind of
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
changing how 608 was written
 
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.370 align:start position:0%
changing how 608 was written
um

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
so we at the department feel that
 
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.349 align:start position:0%
so we at the department feel that
um

01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's unclear in the in the legislation
 
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.769 align:start position:0%
it's unclear in the in the legislation
if

01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:26.779 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.669 align:start position:0%
if
whoever

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
um came up with it wanted the the two
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
CMS requirements part of this or not
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
um and the Department's standpoint is
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%
that the CMS regulations were not part
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the a m work
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
um the a m work really was looking at
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
the two-tier waiver system looking at
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement system and how that's
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
how that can be improved so I guess it's
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
not clear to even us in this legislation
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
if the purpose is to stall the seven one
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
work or just not just but the work that
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't um that would be after the seven
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
one work
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
well I I guess my concern and and
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping maybe that you would send
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
us again because I have lost somewhere
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
in the mall of either my emails or my
 
01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.470 align:start position:0%
in the mall of either my emails or my
paper

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the specific wording language is because
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
they're not stable to this so I can't
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
find them
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
um if or if somebody else has them
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's Grand uh but
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
the the real concern that I have is that
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're not using language that might
 
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.410 align:start position:0%
we're not using language that might
forestall

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
forestall
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
the work that we know has to be done
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
right by July 1st or
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
or something has to happen and I I I
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
implore the bureau to hear
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
the pain of the providers who are trying
 
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to implement it's it's
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
March and they're trying to figure out
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
how they are going to implement
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
something in July for which guidelines
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
have not yet been written and software
 
01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:11.540 align:start position:0%
has not yet been bought
 
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
has not yet been bought
and

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
they're feeling true Panic
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
which is probably not news to you but
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say it again anyway
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
um about how they're going to deal with
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
that and how services are actually going
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
to get billed and paid for starting on
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
seven two so
 
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.810 align:start position:0%
seven two so
um

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
but that's not this bill I just I'm
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
concerned that this bill may be placing
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel do you have a
 
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.290 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel do you have a
comment

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
s um
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just there were two separate
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
conversations about I mean now I'm at
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
608. about this bill within this room
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
and then out there and the emotions were
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
dramatically different
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I was told by one group of people
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a choice because of
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
seven one that this needs to pass and
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
then I was told by another group of
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
people mostly consumers
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
that um number one there was a lot of
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
anger over the A and M how they were
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
picked what their what their criteria
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
were everything
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
and they said that 608 is not necessary
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do it and I'm kind of
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
lost like what kind of deadline are we
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
facing what
 
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.530 align:start position:0%
facing what
um

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
that that's what's the problem is for me
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
because when I talk to the one group oh
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
yeah we better pass this now and the
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
other group said no so what do we do
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say we did draft some
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
language for an amendment for 608
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if the the group or the
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
committee here has that but what we as
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
the department would really recommend is
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we pilot to test the
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the a m report that
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
would include again we talked a lot
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
about the tiered waiver any tiered
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then looking at our I.T system so
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
that would exclude the work that is
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
necessary to be completed for our 7-1
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
deadline can I ask a follow-up yes so um
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of faith um put in the
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
possibility that the federal the CSM or
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
whoever would um give us a deadline uh
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline is that realistic
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
in our opinion no we've had multiple
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
deadlines since 20 uh multiple
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
extensions since 2017 to be in
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
compliance we have however I will say we
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
haven't specifically asked that question
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
to CMS but with all of the information
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and feedback that we're getting we do
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
not anticipate them giving us an
 
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.410 align:start position:0%
not anticipate them giving us an
extension

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
for seven one
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh yes representative Weber
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
so what's going to happen on 7-1 because
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
people say they just can't
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
they they're
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
really unclear and and you know the
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
people I've been talking to who are
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
doing the providing and the billing
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the service recipients but
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact the service
 
01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.169 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact the service
recipients

01:14:17.169 --> 01:14:17.179 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
01:14:20.169 --> 01:14:20.179 align:start position:0%
if there aren't
 
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
billing systems in place
 
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
so so and I'm sorry madam chair you can
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
rule me out of order because I
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
understand this is beyond the scope of
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill but I really want to know
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen between now and 7
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
1 to fix the problem so we are having an
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's actually the core
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
of this bill because there's the fear
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
over how this is going to happen and
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
what's going to come from it so I can to
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question I can say that the
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
billing software
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
um through the state people the
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
providers can access that directly or
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
they can purchase their own software we
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
are focusing
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
um our efforts on the provider side of
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
the requirements for 7-1 at this time
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
whether that's enrolling them as direct
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers which is part of the
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
direct Bill process
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
um talk I think today we're actually
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
having a provider meeting with the
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
department and the the providers of the
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System to go over
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
any sort of training needs concerns that
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
they have and walk them through any of
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
their processes that might need to be
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
altered due to the direct Bill process
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McLean
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so so the part that you're
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
gonna let's say that the pilot doesn't
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
even exist at this point so the part
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
that you're going to roll out for July
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
1st is what it's going to be the direct
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
billing uh how the area agencies are
 
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.729 align:start position:0%
billing uh how the area agencies are
compensated

01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and uh rates is that going to be a
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
part of that too or just yeah so you're
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
exactly right so the direct billing
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be part of the 7-1 deadline the
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
other piece of seven one is
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management where a
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
provider cannot be
 
01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
provider cannot be
um

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be in conflict with providing
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
services and be the direct biller of
 
01:16:25.689 --> 01:16:25.699 align:start position:0%
those Services
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
um so that means you know as far as the
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest you're talking
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
about yes
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the the air as of right now the area
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
agencies are the service coordinators uh
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
so they meet with the families
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
determined with the families
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
um the services that
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
um our family member an individual would
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
need and currently they also have all of
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
the billing processes that go along with
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
those services so CMS says you cannot be
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
a case man uh Service Coordination and
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
deliver Direct Services because there
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
thankful that's um definitely helpful I
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
do know that there is also a waiver that
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that CMS offers and that is the
 
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
only qualified and willing bidder yes um
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
I had received some feedback back from
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
the Department that that was only a
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
one-term one year process but I was
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing some guidance documents from
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
CMS that suggested that because this is
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
due to rural areas like we have lack of
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
providers like we have that that
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
actually could be an ongoing waiver to
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
allow those conflicts in those cases and
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
so my question would be if we could
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
pursue a longer term waiver about the
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
only willing and qualified in order to
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
deal with this conflict especially in
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
those regions where there is an issue
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
can I ask my bureau chief to come up and
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer the question she's she knows more
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
about the only willing and provider oh
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Sandy Pharos I'm the bureau chief
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
at the Bureau of Developmental services
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
speak with the committee um with regard
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
to the only willing and qualified
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
provider waiver or allowance
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
it is up to a year and in New Hampshire
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
we have very select areas that qualify
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
as rural we have a map that we reference
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
that includes which areas are considered
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
Rural and the challenge
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
I think only willing and qualified
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
provider definition would have
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
been more challenging because now we
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
have the option to provide remote
 
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
support so the argument could be made
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
that there are willing and qualified
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
providers that can provide services in a
 
01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.790 align:start position:0%
providers that can provide services in a
remote

01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
remote
 
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.050 align:start position:0%
remote
way

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I would have to demonstrate to CMS
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
that there are no willing and qualified
 
01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.870 align:start position:0%
that there are no willing and qualified
providers

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
that could be remote or in person so
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
with that allowance it it widens our
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
provider Network so to speak and so
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
every year we will go back we'll review
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
Who falls under that criteria under that
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
policy and then renew it if needed so we
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
could certainly extend an existing
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
waiver or renew it for another year but
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
we do have to demonstrate that there are
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
no willing and qualified providers to
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
provide the service
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber and is part of
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
also ensuring that the recipient is able
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
to receive the Services remotely because
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's a real bar
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
in a lot of our rural areas and frankly
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
I don't need to live in that rural of an
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
area and it's a bar in my area big time
 
01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:03.260 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's better now that we have uh
 
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:06.980 align:start position:0%
fiber optic installation in our town but
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
for many towns that have not taken that
 
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.149 align:start position:0%
for many towns that have not taken that
route

01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
route
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are an awful lot of houses and
 
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:15.910 align:start position:0%
there are an awful lot of houses and
pretty

01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
unrural places that have no meaningful
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
access to remote treatment options or
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
remote supervision options yes okay good
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you thank you
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
you may have already answered my
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
question but um I actually have two
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is who actually
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
if there's a cut well we would take a
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
look at the individual receiving
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
services and determine if the same
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
agency provides a direct service and
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination to that individual
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
currently we're asking area agencies to
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
self-report how many people they have in
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
conflict and we have a pretty
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
significant bell curve some agencies are
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
not unconflicted at all and some have
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
significant conflict and so that
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
self-assessment and self-report is
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
coming from the area agencies to the
 
01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:13.490 align:start position:0%
coming from the area agencies to the
bureau

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
and um you had mentioned that there was
 
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
an amendment that you'd prepared for 608
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
where is that now I've actually sent a
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
copy of that I found it in our email and
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
I sent that to Christina I'm not sure if
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
you could print that out I probably
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
should have let you know that I emailed
 
01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:29.659 align:start position:0%
it to you thank you
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
see so this is uh definitely important
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
information trying to figure this out I
 
01:21:36.729 --> 01:21:36.739 align:start position:0%
have another question for you as well
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
how much of the a m report has already
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
been implemented in the state
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
or is anything been implemented from
 
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:55.010 align:start position:0%
or is anything been implemented from
that

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
I would say that the
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
waiver the assessment of waiver Services
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
is underway we have a couple of
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
different work groups that are looking
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
at a m recommendations specifically the
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
rates work group and then we have the
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
waiver work group and then we have those
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
two work groups reporting up to an
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that looks at the
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
work of the two work groups and makes
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us at the bureau so I
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
would say the rates work is underway the
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
waiver work is underway
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
their recommendation around I.T
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
development is underway we're working
 
01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:39.860 align:start position:0%
with Deloitte which is our contracted
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
agency to manage New Heights which is an
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
existing system to make updates to that
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
system to allow for
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
direct Bill and for other updates
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
to happen and so that is underway and we
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
have Myers and stoffer who is another
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
contractor that's working on rates with
 
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
our rates work group
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
there are other recommendation around
 
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
its capacity is a little behind the
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
other work but we are
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
working towards that as well to try to
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
build capacity in our state
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
that is definitely helpful my other
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
question is actually reminding us back
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
to 317
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at this it looks like
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually not just the two-tier
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
waiver system if you look at on page one
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
line 25 it says the commission shall
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
study the feasibility of transitioning
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
from the current single waiver to a tier
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
two-tiered waiver system and other
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the review of the
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire developmental disabilities
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
service system by Alvarez and Marshall
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
public sector Services my question would
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
be if that passed and this commission
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
was in place would you adopt any more of
 
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
the recommendations without consultation
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
with that commission for any of the a m
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
changes and not just the two-tier waiver
 
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.110 align:start position:0%
changes and not just the two-tier waiver
system

01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
I know I'm putting you on the spot I
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
apologize this is such a complex topic
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
that we're all trying to learn the best
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
we can to to do the best we can and not
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
mess things up
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
so the question is if the commission is
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
established would we move forward with
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
the other work outside of the two-tier
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
waiver piece if the commission is
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
established which is charged with the
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
waiver and other recommendations would
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
you implement any additional
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations and make any significant
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
changes with the rates waiver in it
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
um well I I we would move forward with
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
the work if there's no opposition to it
 
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
the work if there's no opposition to it
there's

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's stakeholder work groups that are
 
01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
engaged in the work at this time and we
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
have taken their recommendations
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
on board specifically regarding the
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
two-tier waiver where we were finding
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
that lots of our stakeholders didn't
 
01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
really understand home and
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
community-based Care waiver requirements
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
or many of the practices that we've done
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
for years at the state so we were we
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
realized we were doing education through
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement which really
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
required putting a pause on the
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
two-tiered waiver so
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
relative to our other work if we needed
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
to take a step back and review it we
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
would take that on board from our
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I think you know like you pointed
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
out in in 317 the concern that we would
 
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:39.530 align:start position:0%
out in in 317 the concern that we would
have

01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
as far as any other recommendations that
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
would be limiting us to like like Sandy
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
said building capacity in New Hampshire
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
for bringing people back who have
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment needs so there were
 
01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.990 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment needs so there were
other

01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:25:57.010 --> 01:25:57.020 align:start position:0%
um recommendations in the a m report
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
that we would want to move forward with
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
such as building that capacity in New
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so people who need intensive
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
treatment services can receive them in
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rather than us paying and
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
sending people to Florida or Nebraska to
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
receive those services so that line that
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
you pointed out representative Leon is
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
concerning if it's not just about the
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
two-tier system
 
01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
two-tier system
um

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm trying to understand why if
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
something's not contentious of it coming
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
to the commission and them saying great
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
this is wonderful please proceed versus
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
having a concern to address how that
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
would would limit any of these consensus
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations as opposed to finding
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
those where there's opposition
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
so I think we have we are we already
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
have an established advisory committee
 
01:26:46.139 --> 01:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
have an established advisory committee
that

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
um could you actually tell me the makeup
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
of that advisor what it's called in the
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
makeup of that because that's
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
it is called the BDS systems work
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and you might know
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
the the makeup better than I do but it's
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
comprised of Area Agency representation
 
01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.970 align:start position:0%
comprised of Area Agency representation
providers

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
um individuals with disabilities
 
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.149 align:start position:0%
um individuals with disabilities
families

01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
um that have
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and loved ones with disabilities and
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
some of the other advocacy groups on our
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
website at lists who is a part of each
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that's a department commission it's
 
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:28.580 align:start position:0%
not a right it's not a legislative no no
 
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
you won't find it on our website it's on
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
our website yeah yes and is there an is
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
there any specific oversight of that
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
with the oversight committee
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
to actually representative Weber might
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
know that better do you have do you have
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
a working relationship with that group
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
through oversight not to my knowledge
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
but I don't have knowledge of all of the
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
um do you come is that one of the things
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
that reports to Health and Human
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
Services oversight
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis I didn't think so no
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
however we do as um part of the quality
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
Council that we were talking about
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
before has representation
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
um on the advisory committee
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
but we do not report out any right thing
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
to Health and Human Services as far as
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee less were asked
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that is absolutely helpful
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
um but I I noticed that representative
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
Pearson is in the back and probably
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
listening carefully yes
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
and it's the chair of the Health and
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight committee and
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
also somebody who's worked a lot on this
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
process so if representative Pearson if
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
there's anything where you have Insight
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
that you want to share with us let us
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
know so that we can bring you up
 
01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:41.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
fantastic okay so this one would so
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
looking at 317 that would be
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
something that almost would be working
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what you've already
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
established as a department commission a
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
department advisory Council and this
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be one that's involving the
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislature within that
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's helpful for us
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
as we understand this process now thank
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
you for indulging me to bounce to 317
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
getting back to 608 and looking at this
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
pilot pro project so basically right now
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
the only checks on the implementation of
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
the a m process is that internal
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
department advisory Council and the
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
decisions within the department
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
or are there other checks that I'm
 
01:29:21.659 --> 01:29:23.450 align:start position:0%
or are there other checks that I'm
missing

01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
missing
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
no I would say you're correct in you
 
01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:29.060 align:start position:0%
know as we either make decisions
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
at the bureau level or have decisions to
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
be made they are brought to the advisory
 
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:36.169 align:start position:0%
be made they are brought to the advisory
committee

01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and are those brought to
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight as
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have other questions but
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's other people as well
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
so I mean so I think what you're
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
advocating then is if we're going to
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
Pilot something we're going to Pilot the
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
a m recommendations after the
 
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.850 align:start position:0%
a m recommendations after the
implementation

01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:00.860 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
right after yeah it would be after the
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
seven one yeah July
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so so so the Cs the CMS part which we
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
talked about that has to be July one you
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
know and in in the absence of a pilot
 
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.649 align:start position:0%
know and in in the absence of a pilot
um

01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
what work are you doing
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know are you planning to yes I'm
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to have this stuff done by May
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
30th and so we're going to have a month
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
of debug and we're working with the area
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
area agencies and providers on this so I
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
guess what is the rollout plan prior to
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
July 1st if you're not
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
having the pilot
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
so in our advisory committee most
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
recently we did kind of lay out some of
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have or or
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
potential roadblocks for 7-1 and what
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
our contingency plan might be for some
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
of those roadblocks so for example if
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a provider that didn't get their
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
application in on time to be able to
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
direct Bill what would we do as a
 
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.290 align:start position:0%
direct Bill what would we do as a
department

01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:05.300 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
so we had that robust conversation with
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
our advisory committee to talk about
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
what would be a contingency plan so
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
services are not stalled or changed for
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
the individual in the community so
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
something like that we would either stay
 
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
status quo with the area agency's
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
billing knowing that that's not in
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
compliance with CMS or we could do
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
something as quick as getting somebody
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
as in our provider enrollment Department
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
to focus on that one provider to get
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
them enrolled within a certain time
 
01:31:38.699 --> 01:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
them enrolled within a certain time
frame

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
frame
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so that won't be one of the issues
 
01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes thanks so so what you're saying if I
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
understand it is that if there is a
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the rollout on July 1st
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
then the default remains in place
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
and CMS is okay with that
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I wouldn't say CMS would
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
be okay with that I think from our from
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
our standpoint as the department it's
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do for the individual
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
and family uh we would certainly take it
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis we're not we're
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
not expecting a big implosion but if
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
there are concerns that come up we want
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the services are not
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
interrupted for our families
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes in regard to 608 is there any reason
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
why the department can't do
 
01:32:37.199 --> 01:32:37.910 align:start position:0%
why the department can't do
um

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
pilot programs on some of these new
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
ideas without this legislation
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
no so what does this legislation do does
 
01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
it prevent you from making permanent
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
changes without doing the pilots
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
I would I would think so I think that
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
was the this I didn't we weren't part of
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
the drafting so I you know I think
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
that's probably part of the spirit of
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
um you know but we are very open and
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
have communicated that you know anything
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's not related to 71 compliance
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
we're willing to Pilot and have
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholder feedback and you could do
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
that without this legislation correct
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Weber
 
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.149 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Weber
so

01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
um going back a question before
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
um reminded me that one of the things I
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
was told when I was talking to people
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
outside of this room was that one of the
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
things that the area agencies have been
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
able to do in the past
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
which may actually be some of the things
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about with respect
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
to conflict of interest but what they
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
were able to do that was very practical
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
is because they have a cushion of
 
01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.850 align:start position:0%
is because they have a cushion of
funding

01:33:57.850 --> 01:33:57.860 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
they were able to pay providers and wait
 
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.890 align:start position:0%
they were able to pay providers and wait
for

01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
them to be reimbursed and one of the
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
concerns that I'm hearing out there is
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
if you're a small provider in your
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
direct billing and as we have heard from
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
say the ophthalmologists nobody pays you
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
for six months and you have to pay the
 
01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:24.860 align:start position:0%
people who are actually doing the work
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
what is this system going to do about
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
that at that point
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
um so we we have talked about having
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what we would call it a
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
contingency fund where we would either
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
pay if they the provider wasn't able to
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
um bill on time or there was a billing
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
issue due to the system's change that we
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
would pay them
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
um what happens now is there's a whole
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
prior authorization process that goes
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
through the area agencies then the area
 
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
agencies then pay the providers and we
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that because of some of the
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
I.T and Personnel issues on the
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
department side that process is very
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
manual with these system changes it
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
makes it more automated in our new
 
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
heights system to push payments out
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
quicker so part of Again part of the
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
redesign is is addressing that concern
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
with the area agencies could be sitting
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
on hundreds of thousands of dollars from
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
waiting for us to push through that
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
paper process to pay them and then what
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
they have done is and gratefully so that
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
the area agencies have passed on the the
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
payment to the providers pending
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
anything pending from us
 
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
anything pending from us
okay

01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
um in my reading of discussing with this
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
with people outside of this and in my
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
reading of the CMS guidelines
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
um it seems that another one of the
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
possibilities and I'm from the financial
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
world so sorry for throwing finance and
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
another possibility is to create a
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
Statewide Fiscal Agent that works in
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the organized
 
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
Healthcare delivery system and that then
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
having that entity that wouldn't be
 
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
dealing with are severely overburdened
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
Department in a process that could be
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
outsourced would be a way for them to
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
basically indemnify the timing of
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
payments and allow that to function as a
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal intermediary and billing system
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
which really seems to be what that job
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
and role would be and trying to work
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
with that in order to get to have an RFP
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal limited Fiscal Agent to
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
implement the system because then a lot
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
of those other processes become
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
contingent upon them and the contract
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that's created and so we're not
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with people in the department
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
who then can't Implement something else
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's necessary or deal with another
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
process that we have and so I'm curious
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
about the willingness of the department
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
the willingness to look at it to do an
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
RFP and pursue a path of a limited
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
Fiscal Agent instead of trying to do it
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
all in-house
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
so I can speak from the bureau's
 
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
perspective I I have been a part of the
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
procurement process and it is very
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
time consuming I don't know if we could
 
01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
turn that around by July 1 which is our
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
our compliance date I don't think that
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
would be completely off the table
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I do just want to kind of reframe if
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
if we look outside of the Bureau of
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services the state of New
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a system where providers
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid enrolled and they bill mmis
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
directly so we're not building something
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
from scratch right now per se we're
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
expanding our existing platform to allow
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
new providers in and so that's been
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
helpful because we have a great resource
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
in Deloitte to train providers to bring
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
them online to really align them with
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
practice amongst other providers across
 
01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:51.179 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire there's
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
always challenges relative to provider
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
payment that we understand and we want
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
to try to solve those issues whether
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
that be on the side of the department or
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
on the side of the provider not
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
submitting a clean claim so so that
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
education piece is very important
 
01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
and that's really where we're putting
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
our Focus right now
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
but if we want to explore that it
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be off the table oh thank you
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
it does seem like we do have limited
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
resources and especially personal
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources I'm not sure how many hundreds
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
hundreds of positions remain unfilled
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
overall representative Weber
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just exploring the
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
countervailing argument to that because
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily opposed to that
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
depending on how it's structured but the
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
the things that I have seen over the
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
course of my time here is we have a lot
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
of things that we contracted out to
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
people who have their own Workforce
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
problem I'm thinking of service link for
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
example where they simply do not have
 
01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:55.739 align:start position:0%
the capacity to meet the tasks they've
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
been given and so the services that they
 
01:39:00.850 --> 01:39:00.860 align:start position:0%
are providing to our
 
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
constituents although useful are nowhere
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
near as useful as they might be if they
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
actually had enough people to implement
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
them the other concern I have with
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
shopping it out is for example I have
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
accounts program where 10 percent of the
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
money is going into the price process
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
into the pocket of the people who are
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
administering the program and and that
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so
 
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.250 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so
um

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's it
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
from my perspective if you're looking at
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
it it needs to be very carefully
 
01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:46.139 align:start position:0%
implemented and and implemented in a way
 
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
that they can actually deliver the
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
services that we're Contracting for
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
or that we're hoping
 
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.470 align:start position:0%
or that we're hoping
um

01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
but luckily that's one we don't have to
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
actually solve today
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah well and one of the fortunate
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
things is this is more of a financial
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
instrument and a financial product as
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
opposed to trying to it is Contracting
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
with our different service providers
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
within the state but that's a much
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
smaller discrete base than trying to
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
look at this is true looking at
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
educational processes so the margins
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
would be far smaller for that which
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I still I still remain concerned with
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
these waivers and seeking another waiver
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is a lot for us to do and when I
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
was looking at the history of the
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
waivers I know the Department's been
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
overburdened but it doesn't the amount
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
of progress in the statements to CMS
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
just leaves me a little bit concerned
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
that we'd be better served seeking
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
another two-year extension with a
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
specific plan in place where we've
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
enabled that we're we're going to be
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
pursuing this path this is how we're
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to achieve compliance and we need
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
to take these specific steps with these
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
specific action not dates not with
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
creating the process but the actual
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
implementation steps and I think that
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
that might be a lot safer for our entire
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
community and also you know we don't
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
know what the specific Workforce issues
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
are going to be within the department in
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
the next couple months let's say let's
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
say we have a little Reawakening of
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
covet and we have people out again that
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
might end up being the thing that ends
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
up derailing this compliance and being a
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
little more forward-looking with the
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
process I think would be reasonable is
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
that something where the department
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
would be willing to pursue another
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
waiver with a specific plan to achieve
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
true compliance at that two-year date
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think we'd have to take that back to
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
our senior leadership because of all of
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
the investment we've made all leading up
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
to this so I don't think we can speak to
 
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
that at this time but we can follow up
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful representative
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
Palmer yeah and and my question would be
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
are you particularly all the
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are you far enough into
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
this where if you back off now and then
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
say we're going to wait another they're
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
all going to be even more
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
thrown off
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
then if then if you're already thinking
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
that you can meet these two goals by
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
July 1st mostly and get that out of the
 
01:42:16.139 --> 01:42:17.390 align:start position:0%
July 1st mostly and get that out of the
way

01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
I mean that has certainly been our
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
message to the stakeholders and the
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
providers that we feel that we can meet
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
71 not to say that it's going to be a
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
perfect implementation but to meet our
 
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know minimum federal requirements on
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
7-1 and then look at some of these other
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
a m recommendations other
 
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:36.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the advisor
 
01:42:39.649 --> 01:42:39.659 align:start position:0%
advisory committee after we work out any
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
concerns from that compliance date
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
and my understanding would be with the
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
waiver that we don't have to wait until
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
that last possible date that if we had
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
the waiver and we were able to implement
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
it a week later or six months later that
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
there'd be nothing to prohibit us from
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
from coming into clients sooner is that
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
correct or
 
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
I would have to look into that I think
 
01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
it probably gives a kind of Drop Dead
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
date but you could probably get it done
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
sooner than probably
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
um they would allow that thank you
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to add my two cents
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
because I I find myself very much in
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with representative Leon on
 
01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
this um you know what we're hearing is
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we're going to be compliant by
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
July 1st except that we aren't and we've
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
got systems set up to
 
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
just you know we're going to have people
 
01:43:35.649 --> 01:43:35.659 align:start position:0%
who are not going to be in compliance so
 
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
we're just going to muddle along a
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
little longer and from this side of the
 
01:43:42.239 --> 01:43:44.209 align:start position:0%
little longer and from this side of the
bench

01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
bench
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
it it feels a lot safer getting a waiver
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance rather than saying
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we're going to meet the waiver
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
except that some people aren't uh which
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
feels to me to be really risky
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
um as a as a way of approaching the
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
um and I realized that that's really
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
outside of our wheelhouse but it's it's
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
a matter of huge concern I know
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
certainly in our communities and the
 
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
people we're hearing from are
 
01:44:21.970 --> 01:44:21.980 align:start position:0%
very much on on that same page of
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
compliance is really hard when you don't
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
know exactly
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
what the guidelines are yet and maybe
 
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's happened since I talked to
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
somebody but you know the it sounded
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
very much like there was an awful lot
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
that was going to have to get into place
 
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
that was going to have to get into place
before

01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
they could figure out how to set up the
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
systems to meet the guidelines that they
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
have to meet by July 1st so
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a lot a lot of moving
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
parts to being compliant on seven one
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
and part of our conversations with the
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders was based on you know their
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
concerns about just what you said if
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
they're if something goes wrong what is
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
the contingency to make sure that
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
individuals and families still receive
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
service so that's you know we're hoping
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen we know with a big
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
you know redesign are there are there
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
instances where
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the system might not work because of
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
either an I.T issue an enrollment issue
 
01:45:19.129 --> 01:45:19.139 align:start position:0%
a paperwork issue so we're planning for
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
those uh contingencies but and that's
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
part of our reality and rolling out
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
something as large as this right and you
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
know I'll just add I mean it goes
 
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
without saying but the bottom line for
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
all of us everybody in this room is to
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
ensure that people who need Services get
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
the services that they need and that
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that isn't interrupted correct in any
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
way more than it's already interrupted
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
because of other factors great
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you thank you
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
um this has been a long and very good
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
discussion and um I'm coming to almost
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that everything in Bill
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
317 and 608 is already happening
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
whether or not we pass it and I'm almost
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
getting to the point that neither of
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
these bills is necessary
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
that that's probably more of a
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
discussion with executive session I I
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
don't think that they're precluded from
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
doing anything in these bills but I I
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
think the reason why these bills are
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
here is because there are people that
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this is this is
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
happening and is the focus of the
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
department yeah and I think you know in
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
the previous hearing on these bills I
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
think you heard from stakeholders and
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
families you know the concern about how
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
how the a m report was completed and
 
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
rolled out and I think you're we're
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
seeing that in some of this legislation
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
where you know they felt like their
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
voices weren't heard and that there was
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
a plan developed without them and I
 
01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
think that's what we see in these bills
 
01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um and I I actually do think
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
that our federal compliance part is
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
relevant and completely germane to the
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
608 because that was one of the big
 
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
issues that was presented to us when
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill was introduced that there were
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
the issues around compliance and then
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
everything else that was coming along
 
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
um so to me trying to address this and
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
see what's necessary is actually
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
Germaine important and part of the same
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.870 align:start position:0%
Germaine important and part of the same
intention

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
intention
 
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.370 align:start position:0%
intention
um

01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
so we we can look at this and figure out
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
how to craft it my other question was
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the Holman community-based waivers
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
and the technical guide from CMS that
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
one says that all the providers need to
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
be able to direct bill but in the
 
01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:31.139 align:start position:0%
specific guidance from CMS it doesn't
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
say that they have to direct bill
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
and retaining that option for those who
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
do not want to do that and do not want
 
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
to take the risk and I didn't see
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
anything in the guidance that requires
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
them to even have a direct billing
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
number with CMS so getting Clarity and
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we can do that
 
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think would help retain that and maybe
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
pull some other people into this into
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
the provider Network that may not
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise be a part of this because I
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
would rather have somebody who just
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
wants to doesn't want to direct Bill and
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide some services so that's
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
something that I think would be very
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
important for us to address because it
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
seems like the very path is the path
 
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
especially because you're dealing with
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
that uncertainty of bringing this into
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
these State programs is to try and put
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
everybody into a more similar funnel
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
just for administrative for the
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
administrative benefits because of your
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
resources so that's one of the things
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that I think we probably should look at
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
as well to make sure that that
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the maximum flexibility
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
within CMS guidelines is retained I
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't of that if there's anybody any
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
problem with that here on the committee
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
so I think maybe we'll try and figure
 
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
out some way to redirect 608 to make
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we're moving towards towards
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
requesting waivers and understanding how
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this process done I
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
know we're limited on time again I know
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see how we do that legislatively
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
I mean with a piece of legislation as
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to the kinds of discussions
 
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
we're having here which I see as being
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
really useful and helpful and it it's
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
certainly at a minimum helps us
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
understand and enables us to have far
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
better informed conversations with all
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
of our constituents no matter where
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're situated which is you know our
 
01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:21.350 align:start position:0%
they're situated which is you know our
function

01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure how
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation that likely isn't
 
01:49:31.209 --> 01:49:31.219 align:start position:0%
going to be signed until after July 1st
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
helps us with the July 1st process so
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
which I think is a good reason to not
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee but if on an ad hoc
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
basis some people come up with some some
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
language for an amendment where they
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
believe that it'll meet the need we can
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
look at that next week I'm I'm more than
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
willing to look at anything anybody
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
comes up with but I am skeptical that
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
there is legislation that can address
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
what happens between now and July 1st
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
that will be enacted prior to July 1st
 
01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:04.250 align:start position:0%
that will be enacted prior to July 1st
so

01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think this has been incredibly helpful
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
we've just scratched the surface do we
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:14.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:14.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
so what will be real quick if we can
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
have you come up so that we can hear you
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
for the YouTube thank you thank you
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair we represent
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
the 10 area agencies my name is Alex
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
katrubis with me is our executive
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
director Ellen McCann and one of our
 
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:42.260 align:start position:0%
members Matt Cordero from Portsmouth
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
if I could I just I just want to talk
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
about 6 42. I know you're you're talking
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
about potentially retaining that that's
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
a really important bill to the area
 
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
agencies uh the department just
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
presented to division three in house
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
finance yesterday that only 65 of the
 
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
people who are getting services in DD
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
right now are actually fully in
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
programming getting those services so we
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
rarely see 642 as an opportunity to
 
01:51:10.209 --> 01:51:10.219 align:start position:0%
create more tools to give the department
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
the ability to redirect funds that may
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
be available the bill doesn't
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate any funds it only
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
and representative Robert you brought
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
this up at the health and human services
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh about a week and
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
a half ago can we use dollars that
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
otherwise aren't being spent that the
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislature has appropriated for
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
developmental Services can we give the
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
department tools to better
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
deploy those resources to budgets that
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
are chronically out of date that's
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
putting pressure on the providers not
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
because they're not able to properly
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
reimburse their staff so we're not
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about asking for more
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from the legislature
 
01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about giving them
 
01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
more tools to manage their budget so I
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
would if you want to retain one of these
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
bills I would look at potentially
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
represent retaining representative
 
01:51:58.609 --> 01:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
stringham's study legislation that may
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
be a better option so I would
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you consider that
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of comments at the
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
hearing you know the DD Council had a
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns with 642 uh but we
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
really it's not so much about the salary
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
cap it's really that second component of
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
the bill that that gives the the
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
department the ability to deploy
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
resources that that might not be used or
 
01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
with lapse or would build up in our
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
can we take a portion of those and
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
redirect it so that we can we can get
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
folks in program there's going to be a
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in reps Hall next week
 
01:52:34.129 --> 01:52:34.139 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people are going to are
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
going to come and ask to be a part of
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
the DD system if we're only getting 65
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
of the job done I mean that that's not a
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
good a good situation so we see this as
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
a tool it doesn't require the department
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
to necessarily do anything but it gives
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
them the ability to manage their budget
 
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
better and and we think it can be a
 
01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
helpful uh process going forward
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
my recollection and again I don't have
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
my notes in front of me but my
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
recollection where there are a lot of
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
people who were
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the way things are and
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
thought this would make it better and
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
then there were some who were unhappy
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
with the way things are and thought it
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
first of all is is there
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
a limit
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
now is there a limiter cap in place now
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
there there is not a limit in it there's
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
not a limit or a cap in place however
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
the department does have the ability to
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
deny funding requests that they think
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
are unreasonable but there is not a
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
specific cap
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
in in the spreadsheet as someone I think
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
had brought up earlier that has been
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
taken out okay so if I may have a couple
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
of follow-ups Madam chair
 
01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.550 align:start position:0%
of follow-ups Madam chair
um

01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
this so the first sentence just says
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's not going to establish or or
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
enforce a limiter cap
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
on the direct wages so that
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
so that may limit your ability to say
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't reasonable
 
01:54:19.609 --> 01:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
would it well it the intention of that
 
01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:21.659 align:start position:0%
sentence was they can't just have an
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
arbitrary cap which was like 16 and uh
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
so it pro
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
so so this just says that you can't have
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
a threshold a one-size-fits-all
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
threshold if you read the bill it talks
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
about a reasonable negotiation based on
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
the individual's family circumstances
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
their disability their family situation
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
so the intention of that first bill the
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
first sentence in that bill is is to not
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
have a one-size-fits-all cap which is
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
what had been done previously
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
right but there isn't one now that is
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
correct but but it could come back I
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
mean it could I mean we could do all
 
01:55:00.169 --> 01:55:00.179 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and they could come from
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
us or it could come from you so I get
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
that what I'm driving at is
 
01:55:09.490 --> 01:55:09.500 align:start position:0%
um if we just uh
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
amended this down to allow
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
to the department she'll use existing
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
budget Appropriations to negotiate
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable wages and appropriate service
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
budgets with area agencies and service
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
providers and lost the first two
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
sentences does that get us to where we
 
01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
need to be in terms of
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
the use of the funds available from our
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
perspective the SEC the the first
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
sentence is not as important as the
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
section that you just read
 
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
to us the flexibility to give the
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
department the ability to better manage
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
their budget and again I don't want to
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
sound like a broken record but we're
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
only doing 65 percent of the job right
 
01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
to me that's a failure so again this
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
puts the the tools in their hands if
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
they don't feel that it's reasonable if
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
they don't feel that they can uh they
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
feel this is going to make them
 
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
overspend or the dollars need to be
 
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere else we can have that we can
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
have that discussion but right now as
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
you heard at the hearing unless there's
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
a significant life change there's no
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
mechanism to move these dollars so this
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
just gives us the mechanism on the table
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
so yes the second part of the bill is in
 
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
my opinion much more important than the
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
pro the prohibition on the cap which is
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the title of the bill which I think
 
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
is why folks are focusing on that aspect
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
of it but it's really the second half
 
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
but we could change the title we could
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely we do it all the time
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murphy and then
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative Freitas great thank you
 
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
so much um I was looking at my notes and
 
01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:43.139 align:start position:0%
it really was HHS did not really have an
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
opinion on it it was stated that there's
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
really no wage cap as you mentioned
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:56:50.209 --> 01:56:50.219 align:start position:0%
um that the budgets are pretty much
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
Legacy budgets that are somewhat archaic
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
and they're functionally used from your
 
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:55.910 align:start position:0%
and they're functionally used from your
perspective

01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:56:57.890 --> 01:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
um in that when somebody brought up
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
there was a pretty this may be a
 
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
premature bill it was basically saying
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be a redesign
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget going forward so my
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.050 align:start position:0%
question is
um

01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
will this if you had this to me is what
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
you're asking for is a specific tool
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
within your budget that you may or may
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
not use but with this in any way impact
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
negatively or positively or change the
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
process going forward for the new budget
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
if you're speaking about the rate
 
01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:26.149 align:start position:0%
if you're speaking about the rate
redesign

01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
redesign
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it would necessarily
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
negatively impact that process because
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
we we all know that we have these
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
ambitious deadlines and time frames we
 
01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly when that's going
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen I think this could be
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
integrated into that process and
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
certainly in the meantime it will be a
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
useful tool to help us Implement and
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
fulfill the budget so I certainly don't
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
see it as precluding anything with the
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
the new rate system
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
when that happens is it going to be 2024
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
is it going to be 2025
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
but you know we I don't think we have
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
the answer to that as you've all heard
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
this morning I said many times to this
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee we need to be focused
 
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:08.219 align:start position:0%
laser-like on Direct Bill and conflict
 
01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
free for July 1st that is the primary
 
01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:13.139 align:start position:0%
Mission all of those other issues the
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
two-tier waiver all the other issues
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
that you've talked about the rate review
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
the CIS
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh supports intensity to scale all of
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
those other issues are really things
 
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
that the department is is undertaking
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
not under the corrective action plan
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
they could be things in a m they could
 
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
be other initiatives that we've looked
 
01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:31.490 align:start position:0%
be other initiatives that we've looked
at

01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
so so the rate rate redesign that's
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
something that that is not required by
 
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh CMS it may or may not happen we don't
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
exactly know what form it may take so I
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't see this as in conflict with that
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
it it could be I suppose uh but but I
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
really don't see how I mean it it's
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
really just giving them another tool to
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
manage their budget and deploy resources
 
01:58:58.129 --> 01:58:58.139 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up yeah thank you um so
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
this would not really impact your budget
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
except giving you a different tool in
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
which to to to work with right now it
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
would allow us to take funds that are
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
not being expended and redirect those to
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
Old budgets that may have been set 10 20
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
15 years ago right 30 years ago would be
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
specifically you know how would this
 
01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.570 align:start position:0%
specifically you know how would this
impact

01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
positively or negatively if this bill
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
were not to go forward given the
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility that it may put into your
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
budget if this bill doesn't move forward
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
it will put increased pressure on the
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
providers because they are going to have
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
to live in an environment for another
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
two years where the budget is set
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
the budget was set 10 or 15 years ago
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it just doesn't meet the financial
 
01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
realities and I believe that there's
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to be dollars that are going to be
 
01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.810 align:start position:0%
going to be dollars that are going to be
unused

01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
unused
 
01:59:50.089 --> 01:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
so so why not direct it to the need
 
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:52.460 align:start position:0%
that's really all this is is the same
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
and well
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I representative Freitas had a
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
comment as well catch something to say
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
um my concern was about the rates
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
there seem to be any activity in
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
increasing or changing the rates it
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
seemed to be an issue that day from the
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
people that were receiving services
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes so that this would allow those
 
02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:17.089 align:start position:0%
yes so that this would allow those
budgets

02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
those rates to go up you're speaking of
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
using on expended funding we would take
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
the unexpended funds and we would raise
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
those older budgets thank you that's the
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
intention and that just for
 
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
clarification what I said in Health and
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight is okay we only
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
have 65 of the positions that we already
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
have authorized and funded filled
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
so if we used some of the money that was
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
authorized to up the reimbursement rates
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
maybe we could get to a point where
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
within our existing budget we could get
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
80 percent filled which would certainly
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
be better than where we are now and then
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
if we need to look at more budget
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
requests down the road but we already
 
02:01:15.169 --> 02:01:15.179 align:start position:0%
have that money authorized and the one
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
thing it's not doing anybody any good is
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
sitting in a bucket waiting for a person
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
to come along with the right skills to
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
match the right person and willing to
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
take the job so
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that gets me back to the question of if
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
we were to just keep the last sentence
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
does that get us at least part away the
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
way across the game perspective it's
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
much better than holding it for a year
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
because that's not going to do anyone
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
any good right we would support
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
retaining the study on the two-tier
 
02:01:47.209 --> 02:01:47.219 align:start position:0%
waiver if you want to hold a vehicle
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
well we can't we can't divide we want a
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
different Bill though okay yeah
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative stringham's building
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
study in the two-tier waiver that could
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
be held versus this this bill we're
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
talking about right now
 
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you manager
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I'm just
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious so I understand what
 
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
you're saying so we have excess dollars
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
they're not being used we want to direct
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
them to you know Legacy budgets where
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's people are being under
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
compensated but what's the mechanism for
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
that how much do you know how much to
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
put to here is there
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
you know a legacy budget is 20 so how do
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know how much to give to each of
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
these Legacy budgets because they're not
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
all going to be the same that's true I
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's really implementing their
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
budget I mean that is the conversation
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
that the area agency and the department
 
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
will have to have I mean I think that's
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
really kind of getting into into the
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
weeds a little bit about what the
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
providers and and the department are
 
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
going to discuss but again this just
 
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
gives them the tool to they need to
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
model that out they we need to get a
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
list of how many of these budgets need
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
to be addressed which ones are the the
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
most chronically in need and and we're
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to work through it it's
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
going to take time we may not be able to
 
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
do it all in one biennium but at least
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
this gives us an opportunity to begin
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
solving the problem it's going to take I
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
think a few years to do it because we
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to use up all of those
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
dollars because there could be people
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
who need enhanced Services there could
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
be people who move into the state so we
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
have to we have to be careful
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
and how far we take this but again this
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
gives the department the discretion to
 
02:03:25.729 --> 02:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
take it whatever level that they feel
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
confident that they can do so they need
 
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
to manage their budget and Implement
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
their budget it's no different than the
 
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
folks who are going to graduate from
 
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
special education in in the spring the
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
people who are going to join the adult
 
02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:37.669 align:start position:0%
people who are going to join the adult
system

02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
how do you set all of those rates that's
 
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
something that the department and the
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
area agencies have done for for decades
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's all based on the individual's needs
 
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
their family circumstances what level of
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
disability they have how many hours of
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
services do they need it's a negotiation
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
between the state and the area agency so
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
that would all have to be worked out on
 
02:03:59.169 --> 02:03:59.179 align:start position:0%
individual basis
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
so if we could maybe just move on to 608
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
real quick because I know you have to
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
get going uh we we support the we are
 
02:04:10.729 --> 02:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
very close to supporting the amendment
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
that was I believe drafted by the
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner who represented
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
the department at the 608 public hearing
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
so just so you're aware the area
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
agencies and the department I think are
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
very very close to getting to a place
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
where we can come together on Amendment
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
for 608 that will representative
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
wherever you've brought this up several
 
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
times I think make it clear that we are
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
going to require piloting pending CMS
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
approval on everything except direct
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
Bill and conflict free
 
02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
I mean that's really the issue in a
 
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.030 align:start position:0%
I mean that's really the issue in a
nutshell

02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
and please yeah please yeah I thought
 
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing us um Ellen McKay
 
02:04:52.729 --> 02:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director of csni
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
which is the association of area
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and I would say that this
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee has very astutely picked up
 
02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
the differential between seven one and
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
then the ongoing work and representative
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
Weber you're you're stating that
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
addressing the concerns on 71 with a
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislative solution could be difficult
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
I I did like your idea of having a
 
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative from the advisory
 
02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:17.060 align:start position:0%
committee report out to the oversight
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
DHHS oversight committee as a balance to
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Department's Viewpoint that could be
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
but I think that um as Alex said the the
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
department has very much stepped up and
 
02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:32.530 align:start position:0%
department has very much stepped up and
indicated

02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:32.540 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
their willingness and ability to Pilot
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the work subsequent to 7-1 which we are
 
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
very much in support of and feel is
 
02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:42.010 align:start position:0%
very much in support of and feel is
necessary

02:05:42.010 --> 02:05:42.020 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
for families individuals providers area
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
agencies to all feel comfortable with
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
those changes I will also for a moment
 
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
just speak to on the
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
the 7-1 go live there is a deep concern
 
02:05:58.729 --> 02:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
about being able to pull that off and to
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
do it well and you know ideally
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
seamlessly I think that there's a desire
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
to hear the statement made you know if
 
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're not ready to go live we won't go
 
02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.470 align:start position:0%
we're not ready to go live we won't go
live

02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
um if there's going to be if they're
 
02:06:13.609 --> 02:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
going to be problems and to have an
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
agreement around sort of a dashboard of
 
02:06:19.970 --> 02:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
some kind that can agreed upon
 
02:06:23.410 --> 02:06:23.420 align:start position:0%
indicators of where you know
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
green yellow or red in terms of the
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
sense of are we prepared to go live
 
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
because it is such an enormous change so
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
there there is a great concern about
 
02:06:36.609 --> 02:06:36.619 align:start position:0%
that but I think that as Alex said
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
working with the amended language
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department I think is a
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
solution that gets us to a place where
 
02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:44.540 align:start position:0%
the piloting
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
of the work subsequent to 7-1 would
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Matthew padaro I'm the
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
CEO for one sky Community Services
 
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.770 align:start position:0%
CEO for one sky Community Services
um

02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know something that struck me from
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
when I hear I was hearing and I
 
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
testified it was rep McKay actually said
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
why is this so hard
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
and why this is so hard is because we
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
don't have enough people at the table
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces of information I can
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
give you is that Colorado who entered
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
into the same uh compliance issues we
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
did at the same time has followed for an
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
extension and received an extension so
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
we already have case precedent right now
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we could do this
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
um we had a compliance plan that was put
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
together that had all the stakeholders
 
02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
involved in the state it was scrapped in
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
favor at amm
 
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:42.649 align:start position:0%
favor at amm
um

02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
and why I think we don't want to go for
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
another uh extension or ask CMS for
 
02:07:49.129 --> 02:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
another extension because it keeps
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
pressure on all of us to keep the bus
 
02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
moving forward we are making changes to
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
our system that we're not going to
 
02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
recover from come July 1st when it all
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
goes to pot we are going to be in a
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
situation where people are not going to
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
receive services and companies may go
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
out of business
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I understand what I'm saying is
 
02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:07.669 align:start position:0%
and I understand what I'm saying is
alarmist

02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
alarmist
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
but I also want you to understand I'm
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
trying to tell you we're at the last off
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
ramp the reason we have uh DHHS coming
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the table to Pilot things now to talk
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
to us when they weren't before is
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
because this legislation came forward
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
we need the leverage in order to keep
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
them at the table it's very simple
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
if we can't have that that leverage I
 
02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
need you folks to set up an oversight
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
panel and committee and I need you to
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
get knee deep and hands dirty
 
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
because without you
 
02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be listened to
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to prevent disaster
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm coming from I want
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
people to get their services
 
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:50.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be this hard
 
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Leon came up with a
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
fantastic idea of a Fiscal Agent we
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to change the rest of the
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
system that's already being done in
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
Florida through their CBC program uh
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
satisfying the needs for the DCF
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
um uh children they support it's the
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
same system so they use something called
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
sunbiz they provide payments they
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
validate the payments it doesn't cost
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
the providers anything it's really easy
 
02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
simple to do their version of an area
 
02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
agency which they call a CBC does the
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
same things that we do we check for
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
eligibility we provide oversight to the
 
02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
vendor agencies we keep all the trains
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
running and people cared for in a proper
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
way they get what they need all sunbiz
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
does as the Fiscal Agent is cut the
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
checks and validates the services it
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
gets us into compliance it would take
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
less than a year I think we asked for
 
02:09:45.169 --> 02:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
two years so that we can get all the
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
policies and processes put together it's
 
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
a very smart approach to it
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much for reading
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
the technical manual
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the second thing is we can't come out
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
of conflicts uh free uh stuff because we
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
DHHS has muddled a m so much into the
 
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
conflict free and
 
02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:08.530 align:start position:0%
conflict free and
um

02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:08.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's been so entwined that you
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
can't separate one from the other at
 
02:10:15.169 --> 02:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
this point it's an anchor it's going to
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
drag us to the depths
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
very clearly I want you to have that
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
analogy because it's not going to be any
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
of us it's going to be the people and
 
02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
the families that we support and just to
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
put a fine point on it when people start
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
dropping their kids off saying I can't
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
care for them anymore those services
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
that are provided by families save the
 
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
state about 300 million dollars a year
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
so take our budget double it and add
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
some to it and that's where we're going
 
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
to be not to mention it's going to take
 
02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
up all of our Hospital spaces so now we
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
can't have care for our uh our acute
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
care situations in our tertiary care
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
centers so
 
02:10:52.609 --> 02:10:52.619 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about and
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
representing whatever you picked up on
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
it well we'll just kind of limp along if
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
not everyone is in compliance it's not
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
good enough it may not be perfect it's
 
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
not good enough one of my board members
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
Michelle came here with her DSP and she
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
sat here and I took a couple seconds for
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
her to be able to communicate out she
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
has a bachelor's degree and runs her own
 
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
business she's incredibly articulate
 
02:11:16.609 --> 02:11:16.619 align:start position:0%
without her support she has no ability
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
to exit her home there there is no
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
cognitive delay
 
02:11:23.689 --> 02:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
um that adds to that additional need
 
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
that would be there
 
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
so imagine yourselves similarly situated
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
not capable of going to the bathroom on
 
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
your own showering on your own being
 
02:11:36.649 --> 02:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
able to operate on your own because we
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
decided that it was best to do what all
 
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
of our contemporary selves do we have no
 
02:11:43.609 --> 02:11:43.619 align:start position:0%
children and who are not in the system
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
do because it will make our lives
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
administratively easier
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
we need something to apply pressure and
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's a bill or whether it's you
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
folks standing up for us we need
 
02:11:57.649 --> 02:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
something because the conversations I
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
will tell you I never laughed so hard in
 
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
my life that when I got an email saying
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
we're willing to talk about things
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's not a response that you should have
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
I sit on the rate committee I promise
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
you I'm not listened to I think part of
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
it is because I'm a crank and I hope we
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
all know this but if you watch the
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
videos the very first resetting
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee I went to I said why are not
 
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
why are we not doing what the families
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
asked why are we not engaging them and
 
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
my response was we're accepting the
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
response I received was we accepted the
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations from a m
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I pushed and pushed and pushed and
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
that was the the response I got don't
 
02:12:38.689 --> 02:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
take my word for it reveal it and when
 
02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the two waiver systems
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
New York does a 11 15 demonstration
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
waiver and they actually have a two
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
separate waivers one for families and
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
one for for non-families
 
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
so individuals who are in the system on
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
their own in turn in traditional Care
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
Centers they capitate that at eighty
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they have a waiver
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
system to get around that so we could
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
look at something like that and say okay
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's a system for us to be able to
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
look at none of that stuff to my
 
02:13:06.890 --> 02:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge was brought up or reviewed
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
because when I asked a m about it my
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
response was just that's great please
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
send it to me
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
not having people who have the
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
experiences like I have like Ellen has
 
02:13:21.169 --> 02:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
like the other Area Agency directors in
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
in the beginning is what led us to this
 
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
point you have families that have the
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
ability to have lived in other states
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
that can tell you about Services I've
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
personally worked in other states I can
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
tell you about Services there's a way to
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
do this and and again because we have so
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
much up in the air because of the a m
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
debacle that has been added into an
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
unnecessary change
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible for the area
 
02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
agencies who are in Conflict to come out
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
of conflict because the regs are
 
02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
changing the rates are changing we don't
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
know what they are and how do we create
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
a business and hire people or fire
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
people or whatever we need to do in
 
02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
order to do it so my suggestion to all
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
of you is to I guess either look at 608
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
and amend it to such that it requires
 
02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
that CMS are DHHS go to CMS and
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
earnestly request an extension and I use
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
the word earnestly intentionally
 
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:20.089 align:start position:0%
the word earnestly intentionally
um

02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
and I think if we could get a Fiscal
 
02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
Agent we wouldn't have to make all the
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
changes we're making we are making a lot
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
of hodgepodge pack work uh Patchwork
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
changes right now to our system so when
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking about implementation of a
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
m all the little things we're doing
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
right now is going to implement a m but
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's also so co-mingled into how it's
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
being done to change the uh our direct
 
02:14:50.569 --> 02:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
bill that you know one serves the other
 
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
you can't untangle them at this point it
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
just needs to be either scrapped or we
 
02:14:58.250 --> 02:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
need to go all in and hope we don't hit
 
02:15:01.609 --> 02:15:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you that's
 
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
incredibly insightful I sort of have a
 
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
general question about where we're going
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
here and this is my first year so I'm
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm really asking this just so I can
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
hear back so I had several things
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
there's sort of what we can do and what
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
we can't do as legislators so it sounds
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
like people are saying that it would be
 
02:15:27.169 --> 02:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
really important to pursue
 
02:15:27.179 --> 02:15:27.890 align:start position:0%
really important to pursue
um

02:15:27.890 --> 02:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
an extension past July 1 no matter what
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
which is really up to HHS
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
the second thing is um then we delay the
 
02:15:41.209 --> 02:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
implementation of 608 to sort of
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
correspond to when that happens so in
 
02:15:47.089 --> 02:15:47.099 align:start position:0%
here it's this amendment moves the dates
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
forward to January from July for this
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
pilot project and so maybe that needs to
 
02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
even be different and correspond to
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
whenever you know say six months after
 
02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.189 align:start position:0%
whenever you know say six months after
the

02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:01.129 --> 02:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
H the CMS
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
final date
 
02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:04.699 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
the other two bills is that we we've
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
talked about passing the bill for the
 
02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
council with the amendment
 
02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
and and maybe then retaining 317. so I'm
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
just sort of putting all of that out
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
there just to see where we are because
 
02:16:23.410 --> 02:16:23.420 align:start position:0%
my head is has begun to spin
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to be sure I'm clarifying
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm getting different messages
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
from the three of you sitting at that
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
table there because one of the messages
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
was I think we're really really close to
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
an agreement with DHHS on 608 that would
 
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
satisfy both of us and if that were true
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
I think there would be a huge sigh of
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
relief except that we would also need to
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
hear from the service recipients to see
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with them
 
02:16:56.650 --> 02:16:56.660 align:start position:0%
but if I read what
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
DHHS submitted it's a very a m Centric
 
02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:03.169 align:start position:0%
DHHS submitted it's a very a m Centric
program

02:17:03.169 --> 02:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't sound like it's going to
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
be something that you're going to be on
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
I I'm just learning you to the fact that
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm getting very mixed messages about
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
what our next step must might be because
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
if you guys thought you were genuinely
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
close to coming up with something that
 
02:17:28.570 --> 02:17:28.580 align:start position:0%
will satisfy both sides
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
my reaction is phew I'll review that
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes uh but I'm not hearing
 
02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
that as being a realistic expectation
 
02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
given what I'm also hearing from the
 
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
folks at the table at the moment so I
 
02:17:46.370 --> 02:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
think that Ellen and I represent
 
02:17:49.730 --> 02:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
probably two various sides I'm not an
 
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:51.589 align:start position:0%
probably two various sides I'm not an
optimistic

02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
optimistic
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think Ellen's had more
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
conversations than I've had with the
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
bureau but I go based off of behavior
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
and not off of what is being said
 
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and what I've seen to date and I
 
02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
think what you've all picked up is that
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
02:18:13.969 --> 02:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to say that I think in
 
02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
the true interest of disclosure Alex and
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
I represent csni the association of area
 
02:18:26.089 --> 02:18:26.099 align:start position:0%
agencies is it fair to say Matt that
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
you're representing one sky a separate
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Area Agency so there's a difference in
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint I do personally believe in you
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
know the ability to escalate the need to
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
invoke an extension with CMS through
 
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
conversations with you know we have a
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
tight relationship with uh well
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
an ongoing relationship with dltss the
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner we have a meeting
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
in place with the commissioner if things
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
are going
 
02:18:58.380 --> 02:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
are going
um

02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that we don't believe it's
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
possible to pull off 7-1 we will
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
specifically ask for that if we feel
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
that we do not get a response that
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
um uh favors an escalation we will
 
02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
proceed to escalate separate and apart
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
from that request to the commissioner
 
02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
you know the reality is
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um on 7-1 we need the area agencies the
 
02:19:25.330 --> 02:19:25.340 align:start position:0%
provider agencies need time to model out
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
restructure reorganize re-engineer
 
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
processes it's a lot of work and we want
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
to do it right and I think that I I the
 
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
well and that's the question Matt just
 
02:19:42.009 --> 02:19:42.019 align:start position:0%
to ask can we do that in three months
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I feel like we're at a point where
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I would say by the end of this month
 
02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
it'll be very clear whether we can or
 
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
not and we will request an escalation
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
process around that I'm not sure that a
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislative solution of
 
02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:01.690 align:start position:0%
legislative solution of
um

02:20:01.690 --> 02:20:01.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
saying that the department has to ask
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
for an extension is the way to do that
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's just that's a difference
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
in approach and I don't have the wisdom
 
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
to know the best way to proceed but I
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
know that we do have a path set in
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
motion to continue
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
um uh to have very honest solid
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
conversations with the department and if
 
02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:26.420 align:start position:0%
we feel that we need to
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
significantly escalate we will so
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so yes there there you are hearing a
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
difference and I would say that yeah so
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
we do all agree on 642 I hope so so we
 
02:20:43.090 --> 02:20:43.100 align:start position:0%
got we got that going for us
 
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much microphone please
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
you think I'd learn by now
 
02:20:53.809 --> 02:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
I've been quiet and uh as you've heard
 
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
Charlie McMahon and I have been working
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
on this forever and and it sounds the
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
same to me
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
what what I recognize
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the mental health field is stigma
 
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
and that it's a unspoken word
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a lot of us are suffering
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
from stigma and therefore inside of
 
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
themselves saying this is not a
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
population worth helping
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
which is a terrible thing
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some some
 
02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:42.969 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some some
place

02:21:42.969 --> 02:21:42.979 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
that can keep this uh
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
dialogue going and my guess is that the
 
02:21:53.809 --> 02:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
best place is the oversight committee
 
02:21:53.819 --> 02:21:55.130 align:start position:0%
best place is the oversight committee
and

02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
the uh one of our great members is
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
already a member of that organization
 
02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
and the chairman is sitting in the back
 
02:22:09.490 --> 02:22:09.500 align:start position:0%
row usually sits in the front row but
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
organization that can help
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
to to keep this moving
 
02:22:22.979 --> 02:22:24.650 align:start position:0%
to to keep this moving
while

02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're still young enough to benefit from
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
the hard work of many people in the
 
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:34.570 align:start position:0%
the hard work of many people in the
legislature

02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not pessimistic after all of these
 
02:22:41.330 --> 02:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
years that we can't do something
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
but we can't if we don't
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that the chairman might
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
give us some indication of where he's
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
heading in terms of this responsibility
 
02:22:57.490 --> 02:22:57.500 align:start position:0%
I watched my friend in the middle
 
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
agonize in the middle of this and I was
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
going to say something
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
and finally he did himself
 
02:23:08.770 --> 02:23:08.780 align:start position:0%
but that antagonism is a is a reflection
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
of the seriousness of what what isn't
 
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
being done for this extremely needful
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
population so thank you for the chance
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
to say something after probably 20 years
 
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
of saying something thank you very much
 
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that we'll have
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then I then
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
I'll try and talk about what I think our
 
02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
next steps are
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
it may not be necessary I just think
 
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
that we as much as we would like to get
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
agreement from all the parties clearly
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen and I think
 
02:23:46.490 --> 02:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it would not be better
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
for us to move into an executive session
 
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
because we have to make decisions based
 
02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
on the information that we have and the
 
02:23:55.490 --> 02:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
disagreement that we have before us well
 
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not sure that we're ready
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
to move into executive session on all of
 
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
these bills that we had today but I
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
think that what I'm hearing from this um
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
let me I'll make my statement then I'll
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
see if you have additional questions
 
02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
would be that on 642 hopefully
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber could submit an
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
amendment at some point to change that
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
title and strike that first line it
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
probably will take enough time for us to
 
02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
two lines those lines
 
02:24:21.969 --> 02:24:21.979 align:start position:0%
um to pick that up next week most likely
 
02:24:21.979 --> 02:24:23.650 align:start position:0%
um to pick that up next week most likely
that

02:24:23.650 --> 02:24:23.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
we can discuss if we might want to
 
02:24:29.210 --> 02:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
retain 317 instead but on 608 we'll see
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
any ad hoc work that wants to have
 
02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
happen before we come in next week and
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
look at how to address that one next
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
week I think this has been incredibly
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
productive to get deeper into this
 
02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
complex issue and then after that we'll
 
02:24:43.610 --> 02:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
hear from representative polisov and
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
then we'll prob we may take up
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.610 align:start position:0%
then we'll prob we may take up
um

02:24:46.610 --> 02:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
it may make sense to take up
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
238 when we get into executive session
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
since we had some great agreement on
 
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.070 align:start position:0%
since we had some great agreement on
that

02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:55.730 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then it will need some a short bio
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
break before we get started on the
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
remainder we will be breaking for lunch
 
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
um but we'll see what what business we
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
can get done so I recognize
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative polisov and then we'll
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
have representative Pearson as the
 
02:25:09.889 --> 02:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
chairman of oversight
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you madam chair I
 
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
have a question to the committee I'm not
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
a lawyer but if we look in into 6 42 and
 
02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:21.110 align:start position:0%
a lawyer but if we look in into 6 42 and
lines

02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:25:24.650 --> 02:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
seven and eight I I'm open to the idea
 
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:26.660 align:start position:0%
of living just that sentence online
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
seven and eight but my question to the
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
committee is it specific enough and is
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
it flexible enough to what we are trying
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do and specifically like two
 
02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
scenarios we know in some other in this
 
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:42.500 align:start position:0%
lesson as a
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
organizations have tendency of burn
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
through funds at the end of fiscal year
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
and definitely it's not the situation we
 
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
have today today we have a clear need
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and spent funds but in the future
 
02:25:59.450 --> 02:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
like it's a safeguard and second
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
scenario actually what we just heard
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
from agencies
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
they want us to spend the sun spent
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
funds but they also said don't spend it
 
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
all in the first year leave something
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the future does this sentence
 
02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
allow us that flexibility to leave some
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you those are fantastic
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
points we actually have a superpower
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
here representative Weber is a lawyer
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
and uh so with that we do have some of
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
that I think those are great points
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we sense that maybe we limit how
 
02:26:35.210 --> 02:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's done but I'll leave that to most
 
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
likely all I can say is that if we just
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
leave the last sentence it allows all
 
02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
the flexibility that anybody would need
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
it does not have a restriction but the
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
Restriction is the amount of money
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill 238.
 
02:53:07.010 --> 02:53:07.020 align:start position:0%

then we will take a lunch until one
 
02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:16.190 align:start position:0%

o'clock
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so oh
 
02:53:21.410 --> 02:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 238 we had already had a
 
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt Amendment zero eight
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
four one H by representative Shapiro
 
02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Palmer
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and is there any further discussion
 
02:53:32.330 --> 02:53:32.340 align:start position:0%

02:53:35.690 --> 02:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
um yes and we are missing one member
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
he's helping somebody right now I don't
 
02:53:40.250 --> 02:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
think that either of these will be
 
02:53:42.530 --> 02:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
contentious enough to delay the votes
 
02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:45.300 align:start position:0%

you like to speak to your motion or has
 
02:55:33.650 --> 02:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
that already been discussed I think
 
02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
we've discussed it adequately fantastic
 
02:55:37.550 --> 02:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I may be breaking with the rest of my
 
02:55:50.929 --> 02:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
caucus on this boat I'm going to be
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
voting against the bill and not because
 
02:55:54.889 --> 02:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that the contents of
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
the bill have Merit I just have a
 
02:55:58.910 --> 02:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
problem with Section seven I think this
 
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
is a dangerous slippery slope that we
 
02:56:03.969 --> 02:56:03.979 align:start position:0%
should not be doing government remotely
 
02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everyone has seen the AI deep
 
02:56:09.769 --> 02:56:09.779 align:start position:0%
fakes now and this just puts us closer
 
02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
to a place where someone could
 
02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know mess with our process and it
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
takes away
 
02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.230 align:start position:0%
takes away
from

02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%

18-2
 
02:57:55.849 --> 02:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
the motion passes 18 to 2 where
 
02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro writes the
 
02:57:59.090 --> 02:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
majority report
 
02:58:06.590 --> 02:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:09.530 --> 02:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
if they agree it and if if they agree
 
02:58:11.450 --> 02:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
but it can I I think the point is to
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
write a Minority Report so that the the
 
02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
issue can be made part of the record
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
um were you planning to write a Minority
 
02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
Report or no
 
02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I will write a minority okay and
 
02:58:24.290 --> 02:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
and with that Minority Report
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
um did you want to do an amendment where
 
02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
it simply removed that change to the 91a
 
02:58:31.490 --> 02:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
I can submit something and I would yeah
 
02:58:33.410 --> 02:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay so that'll be with an amendment
 
02:58:35.630 --> 02:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
simply to remove the 91a section so that
 
02:58:37.370 --> 02:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's clear that our intent is to make
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
these changes but that's the one point
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
of contention
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
no consent calendar but it likely will
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
be a Voice vote on the floor
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:58:50.769 --> 02:58:50.779 align:start position:0%

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:53.700 align:start position:0%

02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%

02:59:29.929 --> 02:59:29.939 align:start position:0%
protocol I apologize it it was emailed
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
out previously but paper is good
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%

02:59:40.130 --> 02:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
so as this is being passed out I will
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion this is an amendment
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
that we had helped drafting with um we
 
02:59:49.849 --> 02:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
had significant Health drafting
 
02:59:51.710 --> 02:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is in agreement
 
02:59:53.929 --> 02:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
with this this addresses the challenges
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
that came up in the in the hearing where
 
03:00:00.290 --> 03:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
we had some issues around allowing
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
people to cultivate before they had
 
03:00:03.889 --> 03:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
their license and so it clarifies that
 
03:00:05.929 --> 03:00:05.939 align:start position:0%
language and tightens it up there's also
 
03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
some about the specific plants that are
 
03:00:11.090 --> 03:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
allowed so that we can make sure that
 
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that the number of plants is
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
not excessive but also does not have
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
artificial types time frames that would
 
03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
prohibit the number of young immature
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
but not yet able to be sexed plants so
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
that you may not be culling your only
 
03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
effective plants for the strain that you
 
03:00:30.170 --> 03:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
need in order to treat your medical need
 
03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:34.190 align:start position:0%
need in order to treat your medical need
this

03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%

03:02:05.090 --> 03:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yes
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yes
 
03:02:10.910 --> 03:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck yes
 
03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Leon yes 19-1 with
 
03:02:17.750 --> 03:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the amendment passes 19 to 1 and I
 
03:02:20.330 --> 03:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass as amended by by
 
03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass as amended by by
Amendment

03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is contained within
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment as its replace all is
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:37.969 --> 03:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
it's representative Nagel I think as you
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm strongly opposed to this which
 
03:02:41.570 --> 03:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
is really weird
 
03:02:44.450 --> 03:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
um we we started out with three bills on
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis can you hear me people look
 
03:02:49.250 --> 03:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
closer it might be better yeah we
 
03:02:51.230 --> 03:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
started out with three bills on cannabis
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it was really weird this was the one
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
that I was going to vote for and I and
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
and after I listen to the testimony
 
03:03:00.650 --> 03:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
um it they basically made the case
 
03:03:02.269 --> 03:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
as a little background
 
03:03:06.110 --> 03:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm a pain physician
 
03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I've actually wrote a chapter on
 
03:03:11.450 --> 03:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis in my book
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I um probably have certified more
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
people for medical cannabis than any
 
03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
doctor in the state so it's not that I
 
03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe in it I've also been
 
03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
fortunate on my NFL committee to work
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
with one of the world's leading
 
03:03:27.769 --> 03:03:27.779 align:start position:0%
Authorities on medical cannabis so I've
 
03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
learned an awful lot from him
 
03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:31.250 align:start position:0%
learned an awful lot from him
um

03:03:31.250 --> 03:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we I think we
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
need to really think about is
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
differentiating between recreational and
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
medicinal use there is a very good
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
reason and and I'm going to build a
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
little bit on what Dr knurk said there's
 
03:03:44.690 --> 03:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
a very good reason
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
um you know why marijuana will never be
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
FDA approved and it will probably always
 
03:03:53.630 --> 03:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
be DEA level one and the reason why is
 
03:03:55.250 --> 03:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
that each plant
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
has roughly 80 different cannabinoids in
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
it and what very creates the differences
 
03:04:02.929 --> 03:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
in quality ability is not the two that
 
03:04:05.450 --> 03:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
we look at which is CBD and THC but all
 
03:04:06.730 --> 03:04:06.740 align:start position:0%
the other ones
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
and for simplistic reasons we just focus
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
on THC and CBD which I think can be a
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
little bit dangerous
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but that is what we do
 
03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:18.230 align:start position:0%
um but that is what we do
um

03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
what I've come to understand and being
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the board of one of the dispensaries
 
03:04:23.870 --> 03:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
is that I wanted to understand the
 
03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
operation of a medicinal product
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
as well as I could so I said I wanted a
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
tour of how they make this stuff you
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
know so we went down to a factory down
 
03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts and you and this was
 
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
from a science point of view this thing
 
03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
is unbelievable you walk in there and
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
the guy that runs this has a PHD in
 
03:04:44.399 --> 03:04:46.370 align:start position:0%
the guy that runs this has a PHD in
Horticulture

03:04:46.370 --> 03:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
Horticulture
 
03:04:48.889 --> 03:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
um every element of growing area has
 
03:04:51.950 --> 03:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
sensors in it to control humidity and
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
temperature within like fractions of a
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
degree and a percentage and the reason
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
why they want to do that is they want a
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
product that's reliable and that um you
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
know that they know what's in it and
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
basically they're just controlling for
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
THC and CBD they're not controlling for
 
03:05:10.250 --> 03:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
anything else and so in the end when
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
they distribute a product to somebody
 
03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they know what they're
 
03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:15.469 align:start position:0%
that's what they know what they're
getting

03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
getting
 
03:05:15.479 --> 03:05:16.190 align:start position:0%
getting
um

03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:18.769 --> 03:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
my big concern came out was that when
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
one of the people testifying for this
 
03:05:24.769 --> 03:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
Bill said that um you know she she cited
 
03:05:26.929 --> 03:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
you know how specific these levels are
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
and and the other thing that really
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
interested me that she said and I agree
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
with totally our system doesn't work
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
because cost and access are a problem
 
03:05:36.469 --> 03:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill was designed
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
to do but then it occurred to me after
 
03:05:40.849 --> 03:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
seeing how it's really grown and how a
 
03:05:42.769 --> 03:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
product's developed on a pharmacologic
 
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
basis that the product that you create
 
03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
in your own backyard not in a greenhouse
 
03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
with such control
 
03:05:52.849 --> 03:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
is not really a medicinal product it may
 
03:05:54.769 --> 03:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
be a recreational one but it's not a
 
03:05:57.290 --> 03:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
medicinal product and in the end after
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
listening to what she said I I just
 
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
changed my mind and I said I don't think
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
this is the right way to go
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
um there's better ways to improve cost
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
and access in this state than allowing
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
everybody to grow it and I if you wanted
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
me to go into detail how to do that we
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
can do that but but I don't think this
 
03:06:15.710 --> 03:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
is the right way to do it if we were
 
03:06:18.889 --> 03:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
talking recreationally go for it I'm all
 
03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
for that but that's why I'm opposed to
 
03:06:20.580 --> 03:06:21.469 align:start position:0%
for that but that's why I'm opposed to
it

03:06:21.469 --> 03:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:06:23.929 --> 03:06:23.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King
 
03:06:31.130 --> 03:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chair Leon
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
is that right yeah okay
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:37.309 align:start position:0%
that's all right
um

03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
my question for Dr Nagel is
 
03:06:41.700 --> 03:06:43.370 align:start position:0%
my question for Dr Nagel is
um

03:06:43.370 --> 03:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
this plant has been around since the
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
dawn of man
 
03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
it was never medicinally used for
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
several thousand years and the only way
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
that this plant could have been used
 
03:07:05.809 --> 03:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
medically medicinally is once it was lab
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
grown I mean
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.250 --> 03:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh yes if you want feel free to read my
 
03:07:18.110 --> 03:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
chapter because it answers everything
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
that you just said
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
um the problem that that the way I look
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
at it is that you know when we want to
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
give somebody something medicinal it has
 
03:07:30.650 --> 03:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
to have a predictable predictability to
 
03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:31.370 align:start position:0%
to have a predictable predictability to
it

03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that we get into
 
03:07:33.479 --> 03:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that we get into
trouble

03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
03:07:36.889 --> 03:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
um you know with a lot of drugs isn't
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
necessarily their effects but their side
 
03:07:41.690 --> 03:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
effects and when you give somebody an
 
03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
unpredictable thing with the varying
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
amounts of cannabinoids that's when you
 
03:07:46.969 --> 03:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
get into problem like we know that
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
childhood schizophrenia is increased in
 
03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
incidents with these kinds of things
 
03:07:53.570 --> 03:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm opposed to using it in
 
03:07:55.010 --> 03:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
kids at all and that's another long
 
03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:55.969 align:start position:0%
kids at all and that's another long
story

03:07:55.969 --> 03:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
but I think what you want to do when you
 
03:07:59.809 --> 03:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
give somebody a medicinal product it
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be predictable and at least
 
03:08:04.730 --> 03:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
relatively reliable and and homegrown is
 
03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:06.050 align:start position:0%
relatively reliable and and homegrown is
not

03:08:06.050 --> 03:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:08:08.450 --> 03:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and and that's why I'm opposed
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell representative silig and
 
03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
followed by representative thank you so
 
03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
much I I just in terms of thinking about
 
03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
much I I just in terms of thinking about
the

03:08:17.630 --> 03:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:20.750 --> 03:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
concept of making sure you have a pure
 
03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
medicinal product and that you're
 
03:08:24.170 --> 03:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
getting the same thing
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
um having a child who takes ADHD meds
 
03:08:30.550 --> 03:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
and is given you know whatever
 
03:08:33.290 --> 03:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
generic is available in the pharmacy
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
we've had recently had a circumstance
 
03:08:36.889 --> 03:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
where the generic was switched because
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer is having issues
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's technically the same
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
medication technically the same dosage
 
03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
however this one has completely
 
03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
different side effects than the one that
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
the generic previous generic and so it
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
is a completely lab design product it's
 
03:08:58.610 --> 03:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
a lab made product it's served in little
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
teeny pills you know and and has totally
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
different effect right
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
um in one case the generic that worked
 
03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
perfectly and created the result desired
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
result the other caused an increase in
 
03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:12.110 align:start position:0%
result the other caused an increase in
symptoms

03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
03:09:15.050 --> 03:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
um so obviously not ideal and so I think
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on it Is Well it has to be
 
03:09:20.090 --> 03:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
perfectly lab grown to me doesn't serve
 
03:09:22.849 --> 03:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
the purpose the goal is to help people
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
who have a medical necessity achieve
 
03:09:27.170 --> 03:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
something that's going to help them
 
03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and I mean I'm in favor of
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
legalization in general but I just think
 
03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
legalization in general but I just think
that

03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
saying do we need to recognize the the
 
03:09:37.370 --> 03:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
value of making things possible people
 
03:09:38.809 --> 03:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
who suffer from the conditions where
 
03:09:40.610 --> 03:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
they need medical marijuana whether it's
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
because of Cancer Treatments or to
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
manage extreme anxiety
 
03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's really beneficial if they have
 
03:09:49.070 --> 03:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
access to it without having to get it
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
from illegal sources
 
03:09:52.849 --> 03:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative natarappam
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my comment because
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not really a question
 
03:09:59.210 --> 03:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I've been so incredibly moved by all
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
the families that have come to testify
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
03:10:04.250 --> 03:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
um this is my fifth year on the
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
committee and we've heard
 
03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
um these sorts of bills for many years
 
03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:09.950 align:start position:0%
um these sorts of bills for many years
and

03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:10.849 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:13.969 --> 03:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
so perhaps this is not perfect but it's
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
the best we are offering at this time
 
03:10:20.030 --> 03:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
and if in the future there's ways to
 
03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:21.130 align:start position:0%
and if in the future there's ways to
have

03:10:21.130 --> 03:10:21.140 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:10:23.690 --> 03:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
scientifically grown more perfect
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
medicine that's at a very affordable
 
03:10:26.399 --> 03:10:27.710 align:start position:0%
medicine that's at a very affordable
price

03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh closer to people's homes where they
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
can make access have access to it that
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
would be better but this is what we have
 
03:10:37.730 --> 03:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
today and so I'm voting in favor of it
 
03:10:40.690 --> 03:10:40.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kofot
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes I guess I'll just Echo the
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
statement that I think we heard from a
 
03:10:46.849 --> 03:10:46.859 align:start position:0%
lot of people and specifically some of
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we heard were
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
um the affordability
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the people who are
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing pain are also out of work
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
or have limited capacity to work
 
03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
um they're on very very tight budgets
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
but the bigger issue that I think we
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
heard a number of times had to do with
 
03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
access and particularly because of the
 
03:11:07.610 --> 03:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
limited number of dispensaries in the
 
03:11:10.250 --> 03:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire people who are in
 
03:11:12.650 --> 03:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
the Northern Tier of the state have to
 
03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
travel they can only buy a certain
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
amount and they have to travel some
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
distance to acquire that so
 
03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that it's reasonable
 
03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:22.490 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that it's reasonable
to

03:11:22.490 --> 03:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:23.090 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:11:23.090 --> 03:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:25.010 --> 03:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
let people decide whether they're
 
03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:26.410 align:start position:0%
let people decide whether they're
homegrown

03:11:26.410 --> 03:11:26.420 align:start position:0%
homegrown
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
strand or strain of of cannabis is is
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
adequate to address their their their
 
03:11:37.370 --> 03:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
pain or other other maladies that
 
03:11:38.809 --> 03:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
03:11:42.849 --> 03:11:42.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
03:11:45.410 --> 03:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel's Point all of a
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
sudden made me stop in my tracks and
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
then I thought of what the difference
 
03:11:51.050 --> 03:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
here is between say something that we
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
have like our Hospital you can't bring
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
in your vitamins into the hospital
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
because we don't know exactly what's in
 
03:11:59.570 --> 03:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
them so we're not going to administer
 
03:12:02.269 --> 03:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
them in the hospital but here the
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
difference is it's not if these people
 
03:12:06.170 --> 03:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
were going to grow marijuana and sell it
 
03:12:09.530 --> 03:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
then I would absolutely agree that it's
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
not you don't the person the buyer
 
03:12:13.250 --> 03:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what they're getting but in
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
this case it's the individual person and
 
03:12:18.650 --> 03:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
one of the things in testimony and I
 
03:12:20.570 --> 03:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about this was that if
 
03:12:22.610 --> 03:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're worried about that they can go
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and get their seeds that presumably
 
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
would provide a more predictable product
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
and grow that but I think the big
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
difference for me is that it's this is
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
an individual person's decision to grow
 
03:12:37.849 --> 03:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
this and that makes it different than if
 
03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
if it was a product that was being
 
03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:40.910 align:start position:0%
if it was a product that was being
offered

03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
offered
 
03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you and I'll I will actually
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
add my comments as well uh the comment
 
03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
about generics is definitely a key one
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
and biosimilars are actually even are a
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
lot less standardized than the generics
 
03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
for uh for for Pharma standard
 
03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I do know several Growers uh in this
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
for dispensaries in other states they
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
developed a high level of capability to
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
highly tune their product far before
 
03:13:07.790 --> 03:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
that it was a legal situation for them
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
to grow it so I think that those who
 
03:13:13.130 --> 03:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
need a narrow therapeutic window will
 
03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
probably take on the responsibility of
 
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to get that specific
 
03:13:19.790 --> 03:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
strain but if aspirin ibuprofen and
 
03:13:22.130 --> 03:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
tylenol I'll hit your pain need then
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit less specific so I
 
03:13:25.250 --> 03:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
think that this is a great increase in
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
Access and we can always make it better
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments before we
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
move to a vote
 
03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
no and with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
03:13:37.010 --> 03:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
call the role on House Bill 431 as
 
03:13:43.610 --> 03:13:43.620 align:start position:0%

representative Palmer yes
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%

good first
sorry

sorry
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
first but if we're okay we're not over
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
20 then we're good and uh representative
 
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
nickel do you have any objection to

03:15:11.929 --> 03:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic then we'll put that on
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
consent no objections um so we'll put
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
that on the consent calendar
 
03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:17.710 align:start position:0%
that on the consent calendar
um

03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:20.090 --> 03:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
so no Minority Report if it's on the
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
03:15:24.830 --> 03:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and with that we will recess until
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
um is one o'clock one o'clock let's aim
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
for that let's try and be in our seats
 
03:15:30.050 --> 03:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
at one so we can try and get another 10
 
03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
another 11 bills done so that we can
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
stick to one day next week
 
03:15:37.250 --> 03:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
so if that works thank you
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you everybody sorry for being a
 
04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
little bit late getting back um with
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
that I will open the executive session
 
04:12:05.689 --> 04:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 299 that is prescription
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination in medical
 
04:12:11.040 --> 04:12:16.790 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination in medical
care

04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:22.510 --> 04:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.729 --> 04:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
um so this bill
 
04:12:38.450 --> 04:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
is intended to get ahead of some of the
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
training that we're hearing about in in
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
medical schools some of the idea that
 
04:12:48.410 --> 04:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve Health Equity
 
04:12:50.330 --> 04:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
there's a matter of leveling the playing
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
field and that it's appropriate to deny
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
care to some in order to provide care to
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
others this is something that I had seen
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
as something in the abstract until this
 
04:13:06.050 --> 04:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
past week my mother-in-law was told in a
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
facility that she had lived long enough
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
that she should have a DNR because if
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
she did not have a DNR
 
04:13:16.729 --> 04:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
that that provider would be there that
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
provider would break her ribs the broken
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
ribs would Pierce her heart and she
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
would die then with the DNR
 
04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of this is that is in
 
04:13:30.170 --> 04:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
California so I hope that that takes a
 
04:13:32.570 --> 04:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
decade to get to here in New Hampshire
 
04:13:35.570 --> 04:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh I I did move here from California and
 
04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes I want to say I'm here from
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
the future and I'm here to warn you
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
because there's bad policy that happens
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
there that may have been well
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
intentioned but the consequences come
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
true later on
 
04:13:50.210 --> 04:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
um this is an area where it's important
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to right wrongs we don't
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
create new wrongs
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that we are able to uh to address
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
these these situations
 
04:14:02.040 --> 04:14:03.769 align:start position:0%
these these situations

catching you oh no it's all right um
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
this actually this bill was brought to
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
my attention
 
04:38:36.289 --> 04:38:36.299 align:start position:0%
um by one of the heads of one of the
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes
 
04:38:39.529 --> 04:38:39.539 align:start position:0%
um primarily this has a lot to do with
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
04:38:43.849 --> 04:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
um as you know the label there's a labor
 
04:38:43.859 --> 04:38:44.990 align:start position:0%
um as you know the label there's a labor
shortage

04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
um in nursing homes
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
um it was their belief that um they can
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
train other entities I'm sorry I don't
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front of me so I don't
 
04:38:55.369 --> 04:38:55.379 align:start position:0%
remember the exact name of the entity
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why I can't find it but
 
04:39:01.849 --> 04:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.859 --> 04:39:06.890 align:start position:0%
 
down

04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.900 --> 04:39:08.289 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:39:08.289 --> 04:39:08.299 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
yeah listen you had it
 
04:39:15.250 --> 04:39:15.260 align:start position:0%
oh keep going down down
 
04:39:17.330 --> 04:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistance that with
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
training that they would be allowed to
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
distribute meds and it's basically an
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
access issue because they're struggling
 
04:39:23.810 --> 04:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
to have enough staff to be able to do
 
04:39:23.820 --> 04:39:25.310 align:start position:0%
to have enough staff to be able to do
that

04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:26.929 --> 04:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
um she felt very strongly that with
 
04:39:28.189 --> 04:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
training that these individuals could do
 
04:39:29.929 --> 04:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
that and that was the whole Genesis of
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:39:31.680 --> 04:39:33.410 align:start position:0%
this bill
foreign

04:39:33.410 --> 04:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so despite the uh changing price tag
 
04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm definitely going to
 
04:39:45.890 --> 04:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
support it I think that
 
04:39:47.930 --> 04:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
um it will end up not only improving
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
care for patients because nurses will
 
04:39:51.890 --> 04:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
have more time at the bedside it will
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
improve nursing satisfaction and that
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
will help retain nurses in the workforce
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
and also help lnas Advance their careers
 
04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
and increase their satisfaction and it's
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
also going to save us on
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
payments from the state because of the
 
04:40:13.490 --> 04:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
um differential between the nursing pay
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the m a pay and I will say from
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
personal experience when I work on a
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
floor and there's an m a on one of the
 
04:40:20.160 --> 04:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
floor and there's an m a on one of the
carts

04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
carts
 
04:40:25.010 --> 04:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
um it's very helpful and we get a lot
 
04:40:26.690 --> 04:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
more time with patients and everybody
 
04:40:26.700 --> 04:40:28.190 align:start position:0%
more time with patients and everybody
benefits

04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yeah and I would
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
say that I hope that this also enables
 
04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes particularly the
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
county nurse homes to it to open up some
 
04:40:38.448 --> 04:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
of their beds so we can get people out
 
04:40:40.490 --> 04:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the hospital
 
04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
you can representative Murphy thank you
 
04:40:45.410 --> 04:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
and you know um relative to the price
 
04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
tag I just want to remind everybody this
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
is only a policy bill it's not really
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
tagged any Financial note because this
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
basically just says it's my remembrance
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
um that we are passing the policy that
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
if it proved
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
um it allows them to be reimbursed if
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
Finance appropriates the money to do so
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
so and thank you and if I recall
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
correctly they've already made an
 
04:41:09.050 --> 04:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation for this so it's already
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
part of the budget package from the
 
04:41:10.500 --> 04:41:14.170 align:start position:0%
part of the budget package from the
Department

04:41:14.170 --> 04:41:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything it's been said
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good idea I think we
 
04:41:20.208 --> 04:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
should vote for it thank you thank you
 
04:41:22.490 --> 04:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
and if there's no further comments um I
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
would ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 215.

I would like to open the executive
 
04:42:44.570 --> 04:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 217 establishing a
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%

04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%

and so anyone would like to make a
motion

04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like uh to make a motion it ought to
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
pass thank you do we have a second
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
a second by representative Cushman thank
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you would you like to speak to
 
04:43:07.730 --> 04:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
your motion I would um so initially you
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
know when I heard this bill represented
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
I said well we're not scientists you
 
04:43:12.288 --> 04:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
know what are we going to know about
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride whatever
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but I had a longer much longer
 
04:43:18.170 --> 04:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
conversation with the sponsor and I
 
04:43:20.090 --> 04:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
realized that what they would expect us
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
to do is to gather some newer
 
04:43:26.090 --> 04:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
information about perhaps the dangers of
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
fluorinating our water which 22 towns in
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do
 
04:43:34.368 --> 04:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
only 22 and that there could be findings
 
04:43:37.128 --> 04:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
that it is dangerous for uh pregnant
 
04:43:40.750 --> 04:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
women and if you made your infants
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
formula you know as as I didn't worried
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
about lead pipes anyway
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
um so sir and several uh dentists
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
testified that there's better ways to
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
get fluoride into the population uh
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
sealants and whatever so I think a short
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
study committee would be a good idea for
 
04:44:00.000 --> 04:44:00.830 align:start position:0%
study committee would be a good idea for
this

04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm in favor of it thank you
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to
 
04:44:06.110 --> 04:44:06.120 align:start position:0%

I think that are there any further
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would ask the clerk to
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
call the roll on ought to pass on House
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%

House Bill 217. next I would like to
 
04:45:34.610 --> 04:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on House Bill
 
04:45:38.208 --> 04:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
425 FN repealing the statute relative to
 
04:45:40.970 --> 04:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
Medical freedom and immunizations
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
um a recognize representative Cushman to
 
04:45:44.930 --> 04:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
make a motion thank you I move that this
 
04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
bill be inexpedient to legislate and is
 
04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
04:45:52.250 --> 04:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
04:45:54.170 --> 04:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:45:54.180 --> 04:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
sure

04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:45:57.770 --> 04:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussions in this
 
04:45:59.330 --> 04:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
um medical freedom and immunizations
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've done some work on this section of
 
04:46:08.810 --> 04:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
Law and I think that as it stands it
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
provides some reasonable protection
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
against discrimination by the state
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
um and I think that nothing needs to be
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
done to this law this year and
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
especially a repeal I don't think we
 
04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
should be repealing it as it safeguards
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
um bodily autonomy
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro thank
 
04:46:31.490 --> 04:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
um I voted for against this bill two
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
years ago and I'll vote against it again
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
today I think it's um
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
as we know better than anybody being on
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
this committee there's been many many
 
04:46:46.250 --> 04:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
debates about the common good versus
 
04:46:49.010 --> 04:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
individual liberty about Choice versus
 
04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
public health and
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I think this was a bill
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
um that was damaging to our Public
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
Health efforts at the beginning of covid
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
and I think to be honest it's fairly
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
irrelevant at this point because I
 
04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
believe that it was there was a ruling
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general that it only
 
04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
referred to covid and
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not wearing a mask for the you know
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
one of the first times so I I think we
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
are in a different place and I don't
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
think it's that relevant but I will vote
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
to repeal
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
you will you will vote against the Ito
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes against the itl I will vote to
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
repeal the the original act thank you
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I represent while agreeing with
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
everything that representative Shapiro
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
said I will just say that I came to the
 
04:47:41.448 --> 04:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
other conclusion
 
04:47:43.550 --> 04:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I was one of the ones who did vote
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
for this when we passed it two years ago
 
04:47:49.250 --> 04:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I did so with reservation but I did
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
think that we had limited it
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
04:47:57.650 --> 04:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
that made me feel okay voting for it so
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh to be consistent I'm going to
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
continue to vote for it but
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I really see the other side of it as
 
04:48:06.600 --> 04:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
um I really see the other side of it as
well

04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that I'll speak
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
to it is specifically Limited in the
 
04:48:16.850 --> 04:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
language to the covid-19 vaccination and
 
04:48:18.770 --> 04:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
the department has spoken to having no
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
intention of having the covid-19
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
vaccination for the school children
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
however that's carved out so if they
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
chose to include that in the in the
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
schedule in the future this bill would
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
do nothing to limit that and I think
 
04:48:32.810 --> 04:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
that at this stage in the game leaving
 
04:48:34.610 --> 04:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
that one framework in there is not going
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
to cause harm and that by continuing on
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
with this it does show that
 
04:48:40.730 --> 04:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
that there's there needs to be an
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
exchange when there's something that is
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would ask the clerk to
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
call the role on an expedient to
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%

no objection thank you we'll put that on

consent avoid the discussion on the
 
04:50:17.400 --> 04:50:18.288 align:start position:0%
consent avoid the discussion on the
floor

04:50:18.288 --> 04:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
floor
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'll close the
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 425 at
 
04:50:25.610 --> 04:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
Ben and open the executive session on
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 528 FN requiring the division
 
04:50:30.890 --> 04:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
of Vital Records to collect induced
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's the same one you said 528 it's five
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
oh five eighty two okay perfect yes
 
04:50:44.810 --> 04:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you occasionally I mixed those up
 
04:50:46.490 --> 04:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
it was great with June and July on the
 
04:50:49.250 --> 04:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
trading floor we had an amendment that
 
04:50:51.770 --> 04:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
was circulated uh previously and I do
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we do need the hard copies handed
 
04:51:03.170 --> 04:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
out before we start discussion if at all
 
04:51:05.810 --> 04:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
possible because the amendments were
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
circulated late yesterday
 
04:51:10.730 --> 04:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
the Amendments did come out earlier as
 
04:51:12.530 --> 04:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
well but I thought it was better for
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
completeness to include all of those
 
04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
this looks to be I'll take one of those
 
04:51:26.810 --> 04:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
as well this looks to be a split I hope
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.958 --> 04:51:42.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:51:42.490 --> 04:51:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
there's not an emotion but since we're
 
04:51:47.090 --> 04:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
looking at this amendment um I will move
 
04:51:50.280 --> 04:51:50.290 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment two zero two
 
04:51:50.290 --> 04:51:52.090 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment two zero two
[Music]

04:51:52.090 --> 04:51:52.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
three-0392h to House Bill 582 FM
 
04:51:59.208 --> 04:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:52:00.650 --> 04:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
I will second
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative co-falt
 
04:52:04.368 --> 04:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
seconds this so I will speak to this
 
04:52:04.378 --> 04:52:05.448 align:start position:0%
seconds this so I will speak to this
amendment

04:52:05.448 --> 04:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
um this amendment backs out a lot of the
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
personal details that had been included
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
in the initial bill the initial bill was
 
04:52:15.288 --> 04:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to define these
 
04:52:17.570 --> 04:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
lines within our our own statutes as
 
04:52:20.448 --> 04:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
opposed to deferring outside so this one
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
with the amendment if you look to what
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
begins on line 21 instead of having the
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
extensive language about what would be
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
included it would specifically delegate
 
04:52:33.530 --> 04:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
it to the CDC data specifications unless
 
04:52:35.628 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
they're inconsistent or contrary to New
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law so this would allow us to
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
then carve out anything that we needed
 
04:52:41.930 --> 04:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
to in the future without
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
without future committees and future
 
04:52:46.368 --> 04:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
legislate legislative bodies thinking
 
04:52:48.410 --> 04:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
that we had intended to cleaver to bind
 
04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
ourselves um to the CDC forever
 
04:52:54.050 --> 04:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
this one would I'll ask the patients to
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
provide personal background information
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
voluntarily understanding that if they
 
04:53:00.650 --> 04:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide their information in
 
04:53:02.208 --> 04:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
order to help people understand what was
 
04:53:04.490 --> 04:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
going on with abortions in New Hampshire
 
04:53:06.288 --> 04:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
that could be collected but there was no
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirement to do so basically a chance
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
to let people's voice be heard if they
 
04:53:13.250 --> 04:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
do want that information included but no
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to do so and this would have
 
04:53:19.490 --> 04:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
this would have data protections within
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
there as well and it would also make
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
sure to say that only anonymized vital
 
04:53:25.850 --> 04:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
record information would go from the
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
vital records department
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
so this is a way to come back to a much
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
better appreciation of personal privacy
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
that intention had been in the original
 
04:53:38.570 --> 04:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
bill but it didn't seem to read true for
 
04:53:40.010 --> 04:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
everybody as they were looking to the
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
actual language so I think that this
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment now gives us a much cleaner
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
look at the information should we choose
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
to collect this data and become the 48th
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
state that does so
 
04:53:55.550 --> 04:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:53:57.890 --> 04:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not clear about one thing
 
04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk in this
 
04:54:01.550 --> 04:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee about opting in versus opting
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
out and
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.680 --> 04:54:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
24

04:54:09.470 --> 04:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
24
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
patients asked to provide personal
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
background information at the provider
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
level may or may not do so on a
 
04:54:17.690 --> 04:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
are we talking about opting in or opting
 
04:54:19.798 --> 04:54:20.810 align:start position:0%
are we talking about opting in or opting
out

04:54:20.810 --> 04:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
that should be an opt-in this is uh
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a very very good point
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's is it clear clear
 
04:54:30.368 --> 04:54:30.378 align:start position:0%
right it is not clear
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it actually would make sense
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank goodness we have next week a
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
I I was going to just add to that that
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
if you know I I like the fact that it's
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
either opt-in or opt out either way but
 
04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
I think that that when you get there
 
04:54:55.010 --> 04:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
um you
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
are then making it making the data
 
04:55:01.010 --> 04:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
useless for for statistical research
 
04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
purposes because it's it's this who
 
04:55:05.690 --> 04:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
knows who self-selects in which
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
direction and we've heard that argument
 
04:55:10.250 --> 04:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
again and again about unless you're
 
04:55:12.050 --> 04:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
collecting all the data the data isn't
 
04:55:15.650 --> 04:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
really very good uh so there's that I
 
04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
will I will say that I I think that this
 
04:55:18.298 --> 04:55:20.510 align:start position:0%
will I will say that I I think that this
amendment

04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
overall is better than the original bill
 
04:55:26.330 --> 04:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
so I I would be inclined to vote for the
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
amendment I would still be inclined to
 
04:55:31.850 --> 04:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
vote against the bill as amended for all
 
04:55:33.170 --> 04:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that we've talked about
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
before in terms of
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the data isn't very useful
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
at this point uh it's
 
04:55:43.610 --> 04:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
randomized in ways that and it's it's
 
04:55:48.288 --> 04:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
hackable so I'm still concerned about it
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
04:55:50.760 --> 04:55:51.410 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
um

04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I will speak to the data quality as
 
04:55:56.810 --> 04:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
well on that this uh this would still
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
collect that basic data required by the
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
CDC but the additional personal
 
04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
information would be voluntary so in
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
that when you're doing a data analysis
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
on it it would be either information or
 
04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
none provided so while none provided is
 
04:56:13.788 --> 04:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
a less useful data point you could also
 
04:56:16.010 --> 04:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
look and see that if if those Who
 
04:56:17.448 --> 04:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
provided the data were just
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
statistically different than those who
 
04:56:21.170 --> 04:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
did not provide the data that would be
 
04:56:23.690 --> 04:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
interesting as well and a lot of times
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
data either can answer a question or
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
help us know what to ask that's one of
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
the benefits about how both proponents
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
and opponents of abortion itself both
 
04:56:37.250 --> 04:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
both do see the value in data so
 
04:56:37.260 --> 04:56:38.570 align:start position:0%
both do see the value in data so
um

04:56:38.570 --> 04:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yeah just uh
 
04:56:44.510 --> 04:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
just to clarify I really don't
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
understand so what what is the
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
difference between personal background
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
information what what what
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
like if someone said they didn't want to
 
04:56:56.930 --> 04:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
give personal background information
 
04:57:00.650 --> 04:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
would would be available so that would
 
04:57:05.810 --> 04:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
be marital marital status and other
 
04:57:09.050 --> 04:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
demographic information outside of those
 
04:57:10.850 --> 04:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
that would be required within the CDC
 
04:57:13.490 --> 04:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
framework there are data that are the
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
solid data points that are are necessary
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
to be required if you're a part of this
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
so the data collection we've heard about
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
Sweden that collects everything about
 
04:57:24.288 --> 04:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
everybody but at least if we catch some
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
small part that gives us information
 
04:57:28.368 --> 04:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
this is the intention to capture what
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
the CDC views as necessary data in order
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
to evaluate it while leaving the option
 
04:57:35.208 --> 04:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
to include those optional ones that some
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to mention that
 
04:57:45.060 --> 04:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to mention that
um

04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
we need some idea of how many of these
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
procedures are being performed every
 
04:57:53.930 --> 04:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
year I think it's an indication of how
 
04:57:56.510 --> 04:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
healthy a society is you know whether
 
04:57:58.250 --> 04:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're raising their children or
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
choosing to terminate their pregnancies
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that even if there is some
 
04:58:05.570 --> 04:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
limit to what it provides for us it will
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
still give us some insight and I think
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's important and I hope that others
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
would support it for that reason
 
04:58:15.530 --> 04:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that sort of gets to my question
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
which was I forget which state has a law
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
that basically just collects the number
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
and that's it and that certainly seems
 
04:58:29.570 --> 04:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable data point because I I
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
agree that it would be nice to know I
 
04:58:31.620 --> 04:58:32.390 align:start position:0%
agree that it would be nice to know I
mean

04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:58:34.368 --> 04:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
you know what other things do we do that
 
04:58:35.570 --> 04:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
actually might reduce the number of
 
04:58:37.490 --> 04:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
abortions besides Banning it are we
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
providing better day care so in better
 
04:58:42.650 --> 04:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
our our young families in a better
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
economic position so they decide to keep
 
04:58:46.730 --> 04:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
the child rather than that would all be
 
04:58:49.368 --> 04:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
great but I I think I'd rather just see
 
04:58:51.050 --> 04:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
this amend down to the point where we
 
04:58:53.930 --> 04:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
collect the CDC data that's it we know
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
how many we know the numbers but we're
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
not worrying about whether we're
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
collecting other data that's
 
04:58:58.920 --> 04:59:00.110 align:start position:0%
collecting other data that's
either

04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
not going to be very valid or it's data
 
04:59:04.970 --> 04:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
um could could lead to privacy issues
 
04:59:08.218 --> 04:59:09.890 align:start position:0%
um could could lead to privacy issues
but

04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:12.288 --> 04:59:12.298 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you and I
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
was just going to mention that um my
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that massachusetts's
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
aggregate did only
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure that there may be
 
04:59:22.128 --> 04:59:22.138 align:start position:0%
other states that also similarly only
 
04:59:25.550 --> 04:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
get the gross number only which I think
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful you know but I also
 
04:59:31.010 --> 04:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
question it's you know necessity only
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
because we I'm not sure we keep any of
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
these Vital Records
 
04:59:39.170 --> 04:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
um regarding other procedures that we we
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
tend to do in a hospital so I'm not sure
 
04:59:43.690 --> 04:59:43.700 align:start position:0%
I still understand the benefit of this
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
but in reference to
 
04:59:48.410 --> 04:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
um representative's question in
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is at least one of the 48
 
04:59:54.170 --> 04:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
47 that does aggregate data only
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Seth King
 
04:59:58.368 --> 04:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:58.378 --> 04:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be supporting the amendment
 
05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
because it Waters down a bill that I
 
05:00:05.208 --> 05:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
don't like
 
05:00:05.218 --> 05:00:05.810 align:start position:0%
don't like
um

05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:07.730 --> 05:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
I would like to defend my position a
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
little bit and that is I am pro-life I'm
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
pro-life all the way to the point of
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
conception I believe life begins at
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
conception and one of the roles of
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
government is to defend innocent life
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we should be doing that at
 
05:00:21.288 --> 05:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
conception that being said
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
I don't like the government collecting
 
05:00:23.160 --> 05:00:24.010 align:start position:0%
I don't like the government collecting
information

05:00:24.010 --> 05:00:24.020 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
about people even if there is some
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
anonymity involved
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I just don't like the government
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
collecting information like that what
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is and I I talked to one of
 
05:00:36.650 --> 05:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill when he
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
testified and I asked him well well he
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
said that the reason why Vital Records
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
should take this information is because
 
05:00:47.330 --> 05:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's a death and therefore they take
 
05:00:49.070 --> 05:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
they collect information on deaths and
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
they should do that and I said okay but
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
what about
 
05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
non-induced you know terminations of the
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
pregnancies what about just miscarriages
 
05:00:58.610 --> 05:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
and he said no we don't need to collect
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that information and and I just thought
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
to myself well that's very interesting
 
05:01:04.128 --> 05:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
because that's a death too and so we
 
05:01:06.770 --> 05:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
should be collecting all of it and so to
 
05:01:08.830 --> 05:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
me this bill is specifically
 
05:01:12.590 --> 05:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
targeting abortion and If This Were a
 
05:01:14.270 --> 05:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill to completely ban abortion I would
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
support it but that's not what this is
 
05:01:19.448 --> 05:01:19.458 align:start position:0%
what this is is what is known as lawfare
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's a roundabout way to burden an
 
05:01:25.850 --> 05:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
industry that you don't like and I don't
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
like it when it happens sorry I think
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're getting a little bit too much
 
05:01:30.410 --> 05:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
into motives we're not supposed to look
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
at the motives on that so you can talk
 
05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
to more the data issue but okay well the
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
motives was was given during the
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
testimony so
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
um but anyways aside from that um
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
no um I don't like law fair whether
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's intent or not that's what this
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
will do is it will just cost taxpayers
 
05:01:51.650 --> 05:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
money it'll increase the size of the
 
05:01:53.810 --> 05:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and it's not actually going
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
to stop abortion so for that reason I'm
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you on
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
um terminations or is it procedures that
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
could be also construed for example
 
05:02:17.868 --> 05:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
some people with uteruses need to have a
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
DNC not for the purpose of terminating a
 
05:02:22.730 --> 05:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but for other medical
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
medically necessary reasons and I'm just
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
trying to but it's a procedure that's
 
05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
used for both right so I'm just trying
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
whether it's specifically termination of
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or if it addresses the
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you of Representative
 
05:02:37.500 --> 05:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you of Representative
Weber

05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.970 --> 05:02:42.980 align:start position:0%
it says specifically shall collect
 
05:02:44.930 --> 05:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
non-identifying data on induced
 
05:02:49.090 --> 05:02:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Missouri
 
05:02:54.890 --> 05:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I mentioned it when the testimony
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
was being presented but you know when as
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
we know in this past election this was a
 
05:03:01.850 --> 05:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hot Topic
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and I was trying to have a
 
05:03:07.128 --> 05:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
conversations with constituents about it
 
05:03:10.250 --> 05:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
with nothing to go on so people would
 
05:03:12.050 --> 05:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
say well you know throw you could you
 
05:03:14.390 --> 05:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
could throw at any number and no one
 
05:03:17.090 --> 05:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
would know who's right because there's
 
05:03:20.330 --> 05:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
no information collected for it either
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
you decide to make
 
05:03:25.550 --> 05:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
um a decision either way on you know or
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
know how many are happening and all of
 
05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
that so if my personal thing is I I
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
would find this very helpful for future
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
conversations with constituents so that
 
05:03:38.090 --> 05:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
we both have what we need to have that
 
05:03:40.850 --> 05:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be voting for this thank
 
05:03:40.860 --> 05:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be voting for this thank
you

05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:03:44.810 --> 05:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to be voting for this but
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share a little bit um
 
05:03:52.368 --> 05:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
a couple couple different stories
 
05:03:52.378 --> 05:03:52.910 align:start position:0%
a couple couple different stories
um

05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:54.170 --> 05:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
I've been a member of Alcoholics
 
05:03:56.510 --> 05:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
Anonymous for 32 years and I can't tell
 
05:03:59.208 --> 05:03:59.218 align:start position:0%
you how many people how many women have
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
come to you know have shared with me
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
that they had an abortion and Damned
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
they drank themselves to death okay
 
05:04:06.410 --> 05:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and drug addiction is a very
 
05:04:08.810 --> 05:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
costly thing in society today
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
unless we have the statistics you know
 
05:04:13.490 --> 05:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
the the uh you know the marital status
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
or you know the ages uh you know the
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
find out what demographics are having
 
05:04:20.810 --> 05:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
abortions but maybe uh you know girls
 
05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
from broken homes and stuff like that we
 
05:04:24.770 --> 05:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a name put to it
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
but until that we're we're not going to
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
cure this okay and you know it was Bill
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
Clinton that uh that said that abortion
 
05:04:34.368 --> 05:04:34.378 align:start position:0%
should be accessible and rare
 
05:04:36.770 --> 05:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
we've missed the boat on that second one
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
you know uh we've got way too many and
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
we're not addressing the why you know my
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
sister had an abortion at 14 years old
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh my mother and father didn't know
 
05:04:48.410 --> 05:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay it wasn't legal at the time her
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
boyfriend had access to one and uh once
 
05:04:53.690 --> 05:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
again she was a girl that literally did
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
drink herself to death she was in and
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
out of Mental Hospitals her whole life
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay uh if we have statistics you know
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
that you know a bunch of 14 year old 14
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
15 year old girls in this town will you
 
05:05:07.550 --> 05:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
know are having abortions well maybe
 
05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
just maybe we can start doing some
 
05:05:13.010 --> 05:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
education and maybe just maybe we can we
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
can avoid some of this stuff
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm all for any type of Statistics keep
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
the names out but uh any we we need to
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
expand on this and and cure the societal
 
05:05:25.368 --> 05:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
ill thanks
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.250 --> 05:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with understanding the
 
05:05:33.240 --> 05:05:34.190 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with understanding the
amendment

05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:05:34.200 --> 05:05:34.970 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

05:05:34.970 --> 05:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
so when we had the original Bill and and
 
05:05:40.368 --> 05:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
I think the statistics are wonderful
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
until they get used or misused I I
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
struggle with Statistics in general but
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
it listed a number of things that we're
 
05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to be asked I think this is
 
05:05:52.970 --> 05:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
12 different items that were asked in
 
05:05:54.770 --> 05:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and that's where the
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
problem ran in is that the people that
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this Bill said well
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's too many when I'm looking at the
 
05:06:00.958 --> 05:06:02.690 align:start position:0%
that's too many when I'm looking at the
amendment

05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what statistics we're
 
05:06:04.560 --> 05:06:05.810 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what statistics we're
collecting

05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know it seems to be an
 
05:06:11.090 --> 05:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
open-ended thing to me am I wrong about
 
05:06:11.100 --> 05:06:12.288 align:start position:0%
open-ended thing to me am I wrong about
that

05:06:12.288 --> 05:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you it's because it's those
 
05:06:16.970 --> 05:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
this is replacing that list and that's
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
because instead of that list it is going
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the CDC guidelines on on best on they
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
have best practices for collecting
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics they have those that
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
they view as the bare minimum in order
 
05:06:30.610 --> 05:06:30.620 align:start position:0%
to have a sample of data and understand
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
understand the scenarios around it so
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
this will be the bare minimum that the
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
cdc's requests the CDC has this and
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's one where it would have have
 
05:06:43.490 --> 05:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
the information within there but then
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
there would be other parts that would be
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
voluntary that are the more demographic
 
05:06:47.700 --> 05:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
voluntary that are the more demographic
based

05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
based
 
05:06:51.288 --> 05:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
now I'm really confused because I
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
thought that the uh personal background
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
information was different from the CDC
 
05:06:59.638 --> 05:07:00.890 align:start position:0%
information was different from the CDC
information

05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
or is it the same as the CDC information
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
if if they can opt out of the CDC
 
05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
information then that isn't good data
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
and if it's personal background
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
information that we haven't specified as
 
05:07:15.288 --> 05:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
to what it is and somebody's going to be
 
05:07:17.090 --> 05:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
asking people well do you come from a
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
broken home before they
 
05:07:23.170 --> 05:07:23.180 align:start position:0%
allow a medical procedure for an adult
 
05:07:26.930 --> 05:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
I just think that's inappropriate
 
05:07:29.570 --> 05:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you the CDC guidelines have um
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
have a whole Matrix of them some which
 
05:07:33.170 --> 05:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
are personal information some that are
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's there is already a breakdown in
 
05:07:40.490 --> 05:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
that on the best practices that shows
 
05:07:42.050 --> 05:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
which which are which this isn't
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
something where where where we're just
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
throwing things at the wall and trying
 
05:07:48.110 --> 05:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
to say that we want to know you know
 
05:07:49.970 --> 05:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
which years you didn't have Christmas
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're not digging that deep into
 
05:07:54.050 --> 05:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
people's lives but we are looking to
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
those that they have found about
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
statistical validity and statistical
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
benefit in order to collect these data
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
and to do that not by us coming up with
 
05:08:06.170 --> 05:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
a list but instead using those that they
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
have found to be valuable across the
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
other states and that they have found to
 
05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
be asked and consistent where the CDC is
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
requesting that they be asked in a
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
consistent way so that these data can be
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
compared across States so that we can
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand the trends not just within
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
the states but on a larger basis
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-ups so doesn't that
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
negate the the opt-out provision
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to opt out because they're
 
05:08:31.368 --> 05:08:31.378 align:start position:0%
asked if they're supposed to be
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
and we're saying well you know these
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to be answered and these don't have
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
to be answered or could be answered
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
the CDC has has optional questions
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
included so it would be the optional
 
05:08:44.878 --> 05:08:48.948 align:start position:0%
included so it would be the optional
questions

05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.958 --> 05:08:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um at this point I think perhaps we
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
should call the vote on this amendment
 
05:08:56.570 --> 05:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
and and see where this amendment goes
 
05:08:58.490 --> 05:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
and then we can see from there what our
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
next step would be
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
so with that if there's no other
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
comments I would ask the clerk to call
 
05:09:10.010 --> 05:09:10.020 align:start position:0%

representative Missouri
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I know that in the discussion we had
 
05:10:46.128 --> 05:10:46.138 align:start position:0%
already talked to some of those
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
underlying issues around the bill I
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any need for
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
further discussion or if we should go
 
05:10:54.250 --> 05:10:54.260 align:start position:0%
ahead and have a vote
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative thanks I'd like to just
 
05:10:58.850 --> 05:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
say one more thing to addressing my
 
05:11:01.250 --> 05:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
fellow brothers and sisters in Christ
 
05:11:04.368 --> 05:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
um you know uh King David sinned when he
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
even just collected a census on his
 
05:11:06.718 --> 05:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
even just collected a census on his
people

05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:11:09.650 --> 05:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
and there was a plague that fell upon
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
his people for that just a census
 
05:11:16.128 --> 05:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
we're collecting more information than
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that so there is a Biblical case to be
 
05:11:21.650 --> 05:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
made that the government should not be
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
taking information on us in my fantasy
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
world the government would really not
 
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
care very much about anything we do in
 
05:11:31.730 --> 05:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
our lives it would be almost
 
05:11:34.250 --> 05:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
insignificant and
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
I am very much pro-life but this isn't
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to fix it and um thank you thank

um
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill will if passed would um
 
05:17:01.920 --> 05:17:04.430 align:start position:0%
this bill will if passed would um
require

05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:17:06.530 --> 05:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
independent audits
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
um for a reproductive reproductive
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities
 
05:17:14.030 --> 05:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
in order to prove that
 
05:17:16.490 --> 05:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
um there was no
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
State money being used for abortion
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
services and
 
05:17:22.080 --> 05:17:23.390 align:start position:0%
services and
um

05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:27.610 --> 05:17:27.620 align:start position:0%
we heard from a variety of people that
 
05:17:30.050 --> 05:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
extensive audits were already done for
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
these organizations
 
05:17:33.240 --> 05:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
these organizations
um

05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:37.010 --> 05:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
for or for
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know various reasons
 
05:17:43.730 --> 05:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and so it would be duplicative
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
and also we saw that in the case of
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
earlier audits done by the Department of
 
05:17:52.850 --> 05:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services which
 
05:17:56.090 --> 05:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
indicated that the organizations in
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
question were not you know were keeping
 
05:18:00.128 --> 05:18:00.138 align:start position:0%
money separate
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
that did not seem to have any effect in
 
05:18:05.390 --> 05:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the vote to provide that money
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
for Family Planning services
 
05:18:08.400 --> 05:18:09.830 align:start position:0%
for Family Planning services
so

05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:12.050 --> 05:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
for both of those reasons I don't see
 
05:18:14.930 --> 05:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
any sense in requiring something that's
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
going to be expensive and onerous for
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
these organizations
 
05:18:21.170 --> 05:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to
 
05:18:21.180 --> 05:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to
yourself

05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%

the the largest reproductive Health Care
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
Facility uh in the state that does
 
05:18:41.930 --> 05:18:41.940 align:start position:0%

05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
and lost in the state of Maine and state
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
of Vermont same company by the way and
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
um you know whether they were
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
commingling co-mingling funds taking
 
05:18:53.628 --> 05:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
Family Planning money and you using it
 
05:18:57.410 --> 05:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
for for lobbying uh you know for uh for
 
05:18:59.650 --> 05:18:59.660 align:start position:0%
payment of uh you know of uh
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
administrators in other states uh that
 
05:19:05.208 --> 05:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
they they they they they play games with
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
the money uh they lost both those
 
05:19:08.448 --> 05:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
lawsuits there was one in New Hampshire
 
05:19:11.090 --> 05:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
but there was a deal struck uh this was
 
05:19:12.770 --> 05:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
just prior to covet you know another
 
05:19:12.780 --> 05:19:14.208 align:start position:0%
just prior to covet you know another
lawsuit

05:19:14.208 --> 05:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
05:19:16.128 --> 05:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
um the I I don't think they're entirely
 
05:19:18.288 --> 05:19:18.298 align:start position:0%
forthcoming and we need to keep an eye
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
on them thanks thank you representative
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
Seth King
 
05:19:25.610 --> 05:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree completely with what
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative love says um except I'm
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
05:19:30.600 --> 05:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
against this bill
um

05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the audit aspect seems like a mess to me
 
05:19:38.330 --> 05:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and whether the intent is there or
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
not this looks a lot like law fair
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
a straight up or down vote
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
on abortion
 
05:19:48.050 --> 05:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
I would be totally in favor of but
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is this is just
 
05:19:49.680 --> 05:19:51.110 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is this is just
more

05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:19:54.530 --> 05:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
um more meddling and
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
this could actually have the unintended
 
05:19:59.770 --> 05:19:59.780 align:start position:0%
effect of legitimizing abortion further
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
because the industry is going to say
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
look you guys passed all these laws to
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that we didn't spend money
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
from this to give to that and we're
 
05:20:13.010 --> 05:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
complying with that and not you know you
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
know now all of a sudden you want to
 
05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
take away the right of abortion so you
 
05:20:16.440 --> 05:20:17.390 align:start position:0%
take away the right of abortion so you
know

05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:20:19.550 --> 05:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
to me this just seemed like it would
 
05:20:21.410 --> 05:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
actually give ammo to the abortion
 
05:20:23.810 --> 05:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
industry and further something I
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times the day that we
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
did testimony is that this is just an
 
05:20:30.350 --> 05:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
economic principle that seems to be lost
 
05:20:33.050 --> 05:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
on most people unfortunately and that is
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
all funds are fungible
 
05:20:39.050 --> 05:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
if you give money to an industry even if
 
05:20:41.810 --> 05:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
that specific dollar doesn't get used on
 
05:20:43.850 --> 05:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
abortion it will be used for something
 
05:20:45.948 --> 05:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
else and then the money that they had
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere no longer needs to be spent on
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
those things now they can spend it on
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
abortion this was a big This was um this
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
happens all the time you know for
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
example if we give food to North Korea
 
05:21:01.368 --> 05:21:01.378 align:start position:0%
then the North Korean government does
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
not need to spend money feeding their
 
05:21:04.490 --> 05:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
people they can just spend all that
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
money building Rockets
 
05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
even if this even if that food doesn't
 
05:21:10.128 --> 05:21:10.138 align:start position:0%
get turned directly into you know
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
Rockets there that's money the
 
05:21:13.490 --> 05:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
government doesn't have to spend on on
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
food now they can spend it on Rockets So
 
05:21:18.288 --> 05:21:18.298 align:start position:0%
if we give money to the abortion
 
05:21:20.448 --> 05:21:20.458 align:start position:0%
industry that's money that they can use
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
to you know build buildings and hire
 
05:21:25.010 --> 05:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
staff some of that staff is going to be
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
used for lobbying efforts to increase
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
abortions so it's it's it's fantasy land
 
05:21:34.368 --> 05:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
to think that we can audit audit their
 
05:21:36.350 --> 05:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
spending and somehow segregate the funds
 
05:21:38.448 --> 05:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
you're not segregating anything okay the
 
05:21:40.250 --> 05:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
funds every every bit of money you give
 
05:21:41.810 --> 05:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
to the abortion industry is going to
 
05:21:45.050 --> 05:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
help further abortion period this is
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
just this is this isn't living in
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
economic reality and
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
um for that reason I'm opposed to the
 
05:21:54.530 --> 05:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
bill I'll be voting itl thank you thank
 
05:21:56.750 --> 05:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Palmer
 
05:21:59.330 --> 05:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to just say a couple
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
things one um one of the things that
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
concerned me about this was there were
 
05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
some agencies that were Health Care
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Centers that provide services under this
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
um money that don't provide abortions
 
05:22:14.448 --> 05:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
and so this would affect them as well
 
05:22:16.250 --> 05:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony to that and that
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
would concern me that here's an agency
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't do any abortions but now
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're still going to have to do
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
another audit and cost them money which
 
05:22:24.650 --> 05:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
then reduces their ability to provide
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
cancer screening and STD care and
 
05:22:28.970 --> 05:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
prenatal care which we would like them
 
05:22:31.970 --> 05:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
to do so that's one reason I'm well
 
05:22:33.530 --> 05:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's basically it that's why I'm
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
opposed to this thank you representative
 
05:22:38.208 --> 05:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
Bill King
 
05:22:41.208 --> 05:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that there was only like
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
five agencies that they were going to
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at and all of them actually did
 
05:22:45.840 --> 05:22:47.270 align:start position:0%
look at and all of them actually did
support

05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:22:50.570 --> 05:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
um however I'm going to also support itl
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the very same reasons that uh
 
05:22:56.208 --> 05:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King mentioned is
 
05:22:58.190 --> 05:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
that if you're giving them money
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they're using it to put to you know
 
05:23:06.288 --> 05:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
use for keep the lights on it's hard to
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
say that they're not using the other
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
money for or other money that they're
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
getting so I think auditing is kind of
 
05:23:12.718 --> 05:23:14.930 align:start position:0%
getting so I think auditing is kind of
fruitless

05:23:14.930 --> 05:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
fruitless
 
05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.970 --> 05:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
um and I will make a comment as well
 
05:23:22.670 --> 05:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
part of this bill is was to provide a
 
05:23:24.530 --> 05:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
path to get to approvals from the
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
executive Council and I think that was a
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
lot of an attempt to by the sponsor to
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
find a way to in a good honest effort
 
05:23:35.448 --> 05:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
find a way in order to bridge this Gap
 
05:23:37.850 --> 05:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
so I think that that was the the stated
 
05:23:40.128 --> 05:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill
 
05:23:42.530 --> 05:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I would like to call a two-minute
 
05:23:42.540 --> 05:23:43.610 align:start position:0%
um I would like to call a two-minute
caucus

05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
if I may or if there's a no discussion
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
of Representative Mr Shapiro I just want
 
05:23:49.970 --> 05:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to acknowledge your
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
statement and
 
05:23:57.530 --> 05:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
um that I agree with you that I think
 
05:23:57.540 --> 05:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
um that I agree with you that I think
um

05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know even though representative
 
05:24:05.208 --> 05:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
Edwards was somewhat critical of some of
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
the organizations involved during his
 
05:24:09.170 --> 05:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
presentation I think it was a good faith
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
effort to try to find a medium ground so
 
05:24:14.448 --> 05:24:14.458 align:start position:0%
that money for Family Planning Services
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
would get through I I would just add
 
05:24:17.400 --> 05:24:18.650 align:start position:0%
would get through I I would just add
that

05:24:18.650 --> 05:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:21.050 --> 05:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
when we heard about the expense of these
 
05:24:24.368 --> 05:24:24.378 align:start position:0%
audits it seemed like that would nullify
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
this rather small amounts of money for
 
05:24:28.850 --> 05:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
Family Planning that would come from the
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
state but I I want to I want to also
 
05:24:34.128 --> 05:24:34.138 align:start position:0%
acknowledge his good faith effort to
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
um find agreements so that this could
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
that those funds could
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
um find their way to people
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
services for people thank you
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
oh and if I can call a two-minute caucus
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
back in this corner with the Republicans
 
05:24:49.850 --> 05:24:49.860 align:start position:0%

05:24:49.860 --> 05:27:20.930 align:start position:0%

and with that we've come back from our
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
small two-minute caucus thank you for
 
05:27:26.570 --> 05:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
indulging us

um and unless there's any further
 
05:27:30.410 --> 05:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we're ready for the
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%

all IT addresses is the last two lines
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
that instead of it speaking to it being
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
paid by the
 
05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%

05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
concern I can talk I can talk about my

concerns to it but that's what the only
 
05:30:17.930 --> 05:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%

05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
2023-0803h on House Bill 69 is there a
 
05:30:29.040 --> 05:30:30.850 align:start position:0%
2023-0803h on House Bill 69 is there a
second

05:30:30.850 --> 05:30:30.860 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
05:30:37.010 --> 05:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I will speak to the amendment one of
 
05:30:39.890 --> 05:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
the big opportunities from a cash pay
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
and membership-based model is that it
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
provides a different way in order to
 
05:30:48.410 --> 05:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
provide care and charitable care right
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
now is a challenge within our hospital
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
system because there's so much unpaid
 
05:30:55.368 --> 05:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
debt and there's so many costs from that
 
05:30:56.990 --> 05:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
charitable care that we're moving in a
 
05:30:58.970 --> 05:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
system towards more Medicaid coverage of
 
05:31:01.010 --> 05:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
that but we all know that Medicaid
 
05:31:04.190 --> 05:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
underpays and we also know that as a
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
function of how actually I don't know if
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
we all know but Medicaid has the option
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
to pay six percent less than the other
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
lowest payment so it's not possible that
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
if a birthing facility allows a prideful
 
05:31:22.970 --> 05:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
mom to pay a hundred dollars for her
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
birth because she has to pay something
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
and that's all that won't hurt them that
 
05:31:29.570 --> 05:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid could come in and only
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
reimburse ninety four dollars for
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
everybody else so those rules the way
 
05:31:35.208 --> 05:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
that they're set up up does provide a
 
05:31:37.490 --> 05:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
way in order to undercut it
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
by changing the language to say build
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
directly to the patient this would mean
 
05:31:45.530 --> 05:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
that if some that if somebody wanted to
 
05:31:47.690 --> 05:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
just make contributions to this facility
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
in order to cover other people's care or
 
05:31:51.890 --> 05:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
instead of a GoFundMe people decided to
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
make payments towards a facility this
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
would not be prohibited by law this is a
 
05:32:00.410 --> 05:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
way in order to make to to find a way to
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
have health care facilities that would
 
05:32:05.810 --> 05:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
operate not in the third party payer
 
05:32:08.330 --> 05:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
system and entirely independent of it so
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
that if that were to spring up and
 
05:32:11.570 --> 05:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
Blossom in New Hampshire it would be
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
possible and charity would be something
 
05:32:15.650 --> 05:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
that would be embraced
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
this model has worked in other areas
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
there's actually a nurse practitioner
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
facility It's associated with Azusa
 
05:32:24.610 --> 05:32:24.620 align:start position:0%
Pacific University out in California
 
05:32:27.050 --> 05:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
that has a very very strong nursing
 
05:32:29.690 --> 05:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
program and through that they have they
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
have a cash pay facility and it's more
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
than just a direct care they have they
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
have more so that it arrives beyond the
 
05:32:39.050 --> 05:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
idea of direct care so what this
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
amendment would do would just be to
 
05:32:41.570 --> 05:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
change some of that definition of direct
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
payment I think that if you're opposed
 
05:32:45.650 --> 05:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
to the idea as a whole this doesn't
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
change your opposition in to the general
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
idea and I hope that this moves towards
 
05:32:53.330 --> 05:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
a way that can allow people to express
 
05:32:56.330 --> 05:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
their charity and and care for another
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
one another
 
05:33:01.850 --> 05:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
in a safer way than GoFundMe scams
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
so with that representative Weber
 
05:33:08.330 --> 05:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question because it's
 
05:33:10.850 --> 05:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
been ages since I've paid a lot of
 
05:33:14.090 --> 05:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
attention to insurance coverage out of
 
05:33:17.448 --> 05:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
my own but way back in the day there
 
05:33:19.310 --> 05:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
used to be things that we had to pay for
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
out of pocket no and then a
 
05:33:25.850 --> 05:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh an insurance company reversed us and
 
05:33:27.708 --> 05:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
as we've been told several times today
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
dollars are fungible uh so I guess my
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
question is are we sure that the way
 
05:33:38.330 --> 05:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
this is written
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
takes insurance companies and their
 
05:33:43.610 --> 05:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
payments entirely out of the loop and
 
05:33:46.368 --> 05:33:46.378 align:start position:0%
I'm not persuaded that it does so I'm
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the amendment as
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:55.850 --> 05:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of the power of insurance
 
05:33:58.430 --> 05:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
companies is the power to negotiate and
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
if they're not the ones being billed
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
there's no power to negotiate and
 
05:34:03.470 --> 05:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to obligate an insurance
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
company in order to pay
 
05:34:05.760 --> 05:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
company in order to pay
um

05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
so this is not something that mandates
 
05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
any coverage or any inclusion of anybody
 
05:34:13.970 --> 05:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company and the way
 
05:34:15.948 --> 05:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
that managed care and the way that
 
05:34:19.010 --> 05:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
insurance has moved it is very much
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
based on those negotiated rates so even
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
if you're working at another another
 
05:34:23.160 --> 05:34:24.530 align:start position:0%
if you're working at another another
facility

05:34:24.530 --> 05:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:34:26.810 --> 05:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
if you have one that is not part of it
 
05:34:28.550 --> 05:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
and is not negotiated there's not as
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
much coverage as well so I would expect
 
05:34:31.970 --> 05:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
that this would be excluded from
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
insurance plans because if they're
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
choosing not to do this then it wouldn't
 
05:34:38.448 --> 05:34:38.458 align:start position:0%
be included and I I don't see this as
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
making it accessible to insurance I see
 
05:34:42.410 --> 05:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
this is making it accessible to to
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
charitable care whether within the
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
family or within the community
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King uh thanks I
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
just have a question for you in your
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment um maybe you already explained
 
05:34:54.410 --> 05:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
it and I didn't catch it but the only
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
thing that's different from the original
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment is the very last
 
05:35:00.288 --> 05:35:00.298 align:start position:0%
part there and is not reimbursed or
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise paid paid by a third party can
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
you just give me like an example of of
 
05:35:07.850 --> 05:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
what would happen with the original Bill
 
05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
and like an example of how it would work
 
05:35:11.868 --> 05:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
with your Amendment and just what the
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
differences is I mean maybe you already
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
explained that I just didn't catch it
 
05:35:16.490 --> 05:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh thank you I'll actually
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
give you a semi real world example my
 
05:35:21.770 --> 05:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law was in a skilled nursing
 
05:35:24.288 --> 05:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
facility that was Cash pay
 
05:35:27.410 --> 05:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and so she was the patient but we
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
were the ones who paid so it was paid
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
for by a third party
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's an example
 
05:35:37.250 --> 05:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's an example of a FL of a potential
 
05:35:40.190 --> 05:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
flaw with the original bill that the
 
05:35:42.288 --> 05:35:42.298 align:start position:0%
intention was to do with third-party
 
05:35:45.770 --> 05:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
payers but as the daughter-in-law and
 
05:35:48.288 --> 05:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
the son we are third party to that
 
05:35:48.298 --> 05:35:50.090 align:start position:0%
the son we are third party to that
individual

05:35:50.090 --> 05:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber
 
05:35:51.840 --> 05:35:53.090 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber
so

05:35:53.090 --> 05:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
I get that piece but the other thing you
 
05:35:58.430 --> 05:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
said was that this would allow charity
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
care and other things and
 
05:36:03.530 --> 05:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
um for a charitable donation to be a
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
charitable donation you have to donate
 
05:36:11.708 --> 05:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
to a 501c3 or other qualified entity
 
05:36:14.448 --> 05:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
and that has nothing to do with payment
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
for services because it actually to be a
 
05:36:20.090 --> 05:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
charitable donation can't be for a
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
service you received or that's directly
 
05:36:25.730 --> 05:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
related to you it's why you know when
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
you pay for you do your subscription to
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
W to the public broadcasting they deduct
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of the mug that you get back
 
05:36:39.288 --> 05:36:39.298 align:start position:0%
from your contribution so uh this
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
contributions it does have to do with
 
05:36:46.190 --> 05:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
the situation that you said where there
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
might be a family member paying the
 
05:36:51.410 --> 05:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
bills on behalf of somebody but I I
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
think we I I think if if we're holding
 
05:36:56.090 --> 05:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
it out as
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the I'm not understanding
 
05:37:01.250 --> 05:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
the charitable relationship except for
 
05:37:04.128 --> 05:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
the charitable good Notions of somebody
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
else I think you can just make a
 
05:37:09.490 --> 05:37:09.500 align:start position:0%
donation but I'm I'm still
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
anxious that this might be
 
05:37:15.050 --> 05:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
a way
 
05:37:20.330 --> 05:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
of getting building and getting dollars
 
05:37:23.448 --> 05:37:23.458 align:start position:0%
back from
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
an insurance company because
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
you know you pay the dollars and you
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
submit the claim and they'll pay you
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they decide to pay based on all
 
05:37:34.250 --> 05:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
those negotiations that you were talking
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
about which is perfectly clear and I
 
05:37:38.570 --> 05:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that happens or not
 
05:37:40.850 --> 05:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that because I don't
 
05:37:40.860 --> 05:37:42.890 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that because I don't
know

05:37:42.890 --> 05:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:37:45.170 --> 05:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
I'm still going to vote no
 
05:37:45.180 --> 05:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
I'm still going to vote no
uh

05:37:46.670 --> 05:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative dangle I think
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
just to build on that by definition
 
05:37:52.610 --> 05:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
these are not non-profit organizations
 
05:37:54.530 --> 05:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that you can make a
 
05:37:56.810 --> 05:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
donation that certainly tax deductible I
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
mean if you want to pay for somebody
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
else's carry you can do that right
 
05:38:04.090 --> 05:38:04.100 align:start position:0%
you're right thank you thank you
 
05:38:06.650 --> 05:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative sorry did you have a your
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
hands no longer up my oh it has been a
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
long week so far get ready for tomorrow
 
05:38:16.850 --> 05:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I think you you
 
05:38:19.610 --> 05:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
already employed or said this that you
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
know if we had
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
that this this changes things and
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies things
 
05:38:28.010 --> 05:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but that if we in principle if we
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
were against the first bill um we'd
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
likely be against this bill and I think
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
two of the principles involved that some
 
05:38:38.090 --> 05:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
people would see different ways
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
um are one that this
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
could involve cherry picking of of
 
05:38:48.050 --> 05:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
people who can actually pay and leaving
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
other providers who have to give
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
charitable care who have to take anybody
 
05:38:56.030 --> 05:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
who comes to their doors a greater
 
05:38:58.730 --> 05:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who are under
 
05:39:02.930 --> 05:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or unreimbursed and so that's
 
05:39:05.330 --> 05:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
a concern of mine
 
05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against the bill
 
05:39:10.730 --> 05:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
um if you have reservations about the
 
05:39:16.610 --> 05:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill representative Shapiro
 
05:39:18.530 --> 05:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know I think you're correct but with
 
05:39:20.570 --> 05:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
respect to the intention of the bill
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is to uh you know bring forth
 
05:39:25.610 --> 05:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
transparency and to alleviate
 
05:39:28.490 --> 05:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
administrative uh burden uh with respect
 
05:39:31.330 --> 05:39:31.340 align:start position:0%
to the provider this amendment
 
05:39:33.410 --> 05:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
accomplishes you know both of those
 
05:39:35.570 --> 05:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
goals as well so I am going to support
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I think the real
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
debate is going to be about the
 
05:39:41.330 --> 05:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill itself so
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will speak to our
 
05:39:46.730 --> 05:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
definition of charitable I think
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber was talking to the
 
05:39:50.810 --> 05:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
legal and taxable definition of
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
charitable I was talking to those
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
charitable people who used to show up at
 
05:39:56.690 --> 05:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
Kmart when it was in business and pay
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
off people's Christmas club or those who
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
would go and pay off people's school
 
05:40:02.930 --> 05:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
lunches because uh this it's an appeal
 
05:40:05.208 --> 05:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
to people's people's better better
 
05:40:07.850 --> 05:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
selves and I think that we do see that
 
05:40:10.010 --> 05:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
in action quite a bit so I think that
 
05:40:11.690 --> 05:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
this this bill is written in optimism
 
05:40:14.470 --> 05:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
that people do want to care for others
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
and then there's people who deal in in
 
05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
the idea that they've seen that fall
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
short enough times that they believe
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
that we need a different set of
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
safeguards so that's not a matter of
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
anybody being wrong it's just a
 
05:40:27.890 --> 05:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
difference of of how to approach the
 
05:40:29.628 --> 05:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
same problem and making sure we get high
 
05:40:32.890 --> 05:40:32.900 align:start position:0%
quality affordable care to people
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you
 
05:40:37.190 --> 05:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
another question here
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
um one thing I like about the wording of
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
the amended bill is
 
05:40:44.330 --> 05:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me like the original
 
05:40:48.110 --> 05:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill is untenable because it says and is
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
not reimbursed or otherwise paid by a
 
05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
third party but that seems totally
 
05:40:53.750 --> 05:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
unenforceable to me I mean how can you
 
05:40:55.610 --> 05:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
how can how can the government ever know
 
05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
if somebody pays your bill for you after
 
05:41:00.230 --> 05:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
the fact so that's since it's
 
05:41:00.240 --> 05:41:01.730 align:start position:0%
the fact so that's since it's
unenforceable

05:41:01.730 --> 05:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
05:41:03.770 --> 05:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
it seems like that shouldn't even be
 
05:41:05.810 --> 05:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
there and that's why I support the
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
amended Bill and so I think the real
 
05:41:10.010 --> 05:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
debate would be on the the bill itself
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
but I think the amended bill just makes
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
sense from an enforceability point of
 
05:41:16.610 --> 05:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
view so thank you
 
05:41:19.610 --> 05:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
um if not I will ask the clerk to call
 
05:41:28.330 --> 05:41:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:37.250 --> 05:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:40.910 --> 05:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman yes
 
05:41:43.128 --> 05:41:43.138 align:start position:0%

05:42:07.270 --> 05:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weber no
 
05:42:10.550 --> 05:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative McKay no
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
Representative friedas no
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon no
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham no
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:42:23.878 --> 05:42:25.368 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
no

05:42:25.368 --> 05:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:42:27.470 --> 05:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
05:42:27.480 --> 05:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
no

05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:42:31.970 --> 05:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy no
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer no
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck no
 
05:42:42.650 --> 05:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
and representative land yes
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative and the motion fails so
 
05:42:52.150 --> 05:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not adopted
 
05:42:54.410 --> 05:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative McLean I'll recognize you
 
05:42:56.390 --> 05:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on
 
05:43:01.250 --> 05:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
hb69 as introduced
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
and I'll second
 
05:43:05.810 --> 05:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
um is there a further debate or did we
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
already get to the core of the issue oh
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Palmer and then
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative yes so my concern and a
 
05:43:17.390 --> 05:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of vaguely remembering some
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
testimony my concern is sort of
 
05:43:21.770 --> 05:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of
 
05:43:23.810 --> 05:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
um sort of for-profit organizations
 
05:43:26.090 --> 05:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
moving into the state and I think
 
05:43:27.770 --> 05:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned before cherry picking
 
05:43:31.128 --> 05:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
and so while I like the idea of you know
 
05:43:33.650 --> 05:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
like if somebody goes to the hospital
 
05:43:36.050 --> 05:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
and somebody else wants to help pay the
 
05:43:37.490 --> 05:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
bill or that kind of thing it would be
 
05:43:40.250 --> 05:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
great to have that happen and I'm not
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't happen a lot now
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
and there certainly are concierge
 
05:43:46.730 --> 05:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
practices in New Hampshire that only
 
05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
take you know like a monthly payment
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
already so I'm I just I'm worried about
 
05:43:54.288 --> 05:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences and would
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
like some reassurance either in modified
 
05:43:58.490 --> 05:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
language or somebody who's a better
 
05:44:00.670 --> 05:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer than I am to
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
sorry if I can just get to a little bit
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
more clarification
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
um do you have a problem with concierge
 
05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
care when it gets into the healthcare
 
05:44:09.360 --> 05:44:11.628 align:start position:0%
care when it gets into the healthcare
facilities

05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:44:11.638 --> 05:44:13.010 align:start position:0%
facilities
um

05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
well actually I don't know of any
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
examples in facilities mostly just
 
05:44:18.410 --> 05:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
private practices and there's some
 
05:44:20.270 --> 05:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
controversy there
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
um there's the one that I know of in
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hanover it's two you know great doctors
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
who do a great job and the problem for a
 
05:44:29.570 --> 05:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
lot of other people is that it works in
 
05:44:31.010 --> 05:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hanover because there are enough people
 
05:44:33.470 --> 05:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
in Hanover that can afford it where it
 
05:44:35.810 --> 05:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't maybe work in Claremont or in
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
the North country you know North Country
 
05:44:37.798 --> 05:44:38.890 align:start position:0%
the North country you know North Country
so

05:44:38.890 --> 05:44:38.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:40.850 --> 05:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:44:42.890 --> 05:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
but I'm just my point there was that it
 
05:44:44.570 --> 05:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
it does exist
 
05:44:47.868 --> 05:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Seth King
 
05:44:49.610 --> 05:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
05:44:49.620 --> 05:44:52.128 align:start position:0%
thank you again
um

05:44:52.128 --> 05:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony on this bill
 
05:44:57.530 --> 05:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
everybody whether they were poor or
 
05:45:00.048 --> 05:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
against it admitted to the fact that the
 
05:45:02.690 --> 05:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
current system is really broken it's in
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
really really bad shape and that's
 
05:45:08.448 --> 05:45:08.458 align:start position:0%
affecting everybody uh Rich poor young
 
05:45:10.850 --> 05:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
old everybody's being affected by this
 
05:45:13.970 --> 05:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
even the employees that work at these at
 
05:45:15.830 --> 05:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
these institutions
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
um they're suffering and as a result of
 
05:45:20.530 --> 05:45:20.540 align:start position:0%
this really horribly broken system
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
people are opting out my wife is one of
 
05:45:25.128 --> 05:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
them she's a nurse she worked in the
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
hospital and other in other cares and
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
she just got sick of it and and I know
 
05:45:32.330 --> 05:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
this is happening not just in this
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
country but around the world and and
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's a it's a vicious cycle
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we're spiraling down and something
 
05:45:45.048 --> 05:45:45.058 align:start position:0%
has to be done and this allows people an
 
05:45:47.150 --> 05:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
option to just opt out of that whole
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
system it's like it and we we allow this
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
for other Industries I mean if you want
 
05:45:54.890 --> 05:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
to open up a shop and not accept credit
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
cards you can do that you can just be a
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
cash only business and you might have
 
05:46:00.590 --> 05:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
some struggles you might have some
 
05:46:02.270 --> 05:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
benefits but we at least allow them the
 
05:46:04.970 --> 05:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
freedom of doing that here this allows
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
people who want to just cut out the
 
05:46:10.128 --> 05:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
middleman and just work directly with
 
05:46:12.650 --> 05:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
the consumer and I think that's a really
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
nice thing and the only real argument I
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
could hear anybody saying against that
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
is that they're a they want to keep
 
05:46:25.250 --> 05:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
propped up this zombie industry this
 
05:46:27.410 --> 05:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
industry that is for all intents and
 
05:46:30.530 --> 05:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
purposes dead but it's being kept alive
 
05:46:35.330 --> 05:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
through government Fiat and
 
05:46:38.090 --> 05:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's that that's gonna hurt that hurts
 
05:46:41.270 --> 05:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
everybody and it hurts our care too and
 
05:46:43.010 --> 05:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the people aren't
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
getting the best care and so yeah there
 
05:46:46.670 --> 05:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
might be a short period of time where
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's concierge care for for for
 
05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
um cash pairs only but you know that's
 
05:46:55.628 --> 05:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
just life I mean everything that ever
 
05:46:58.610 --> 05:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
comes about starts off concierge I mean
 
05:47:00.410 --> 05:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
when the CD player first came out it was
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
like two thousand dollars for a CD
 
05:47:04.010 --> 05:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
player but you know within a matter of
 
05:47:05.570 --> 05:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
years they were ubiquitous everybody had
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
a CD player they'd they'd give them away
 
05:47:09.890 --> 05:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
if you wanted one so yeah there's there
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
there might be a little hiccup at the
 
05:47:13.910 --> 05:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
very beginning where it's concierge care
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
but it won't be long before we've cut
 
05:47:19.010 --> 05:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
out the middleman the every person can
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
afford to just pay for their medical
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
bills just like they do when they go to
 
05:47:25.490 --> 05:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
the gas station and our care is going to
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
be better people are going to be happier
 
05:47:29.330 --> 05:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
that would just be such a wonderful
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
thing and and I'm just sorry that people
 
05:47:34.250 --> 05:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
are so afraid of keeping a zombie
 
05:47:36.410 --> 05:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
industry careful you're getting going to
 
05:47:38.690 --> 05:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
object very strenuously to the use of
 
05:47:40.850 --> 05:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
that term because
 
05:47:43.788 --> 05:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
well I just eject strainlessly to the
 
05:47:45.230 --> 05:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
use of that term there are many people
 
05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
who are working very hard in that zombie
 
05:47:49.250 --> 05:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
industry and they should not be
 
05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
stigmatized I wasn't okay fair enough
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't trying to stigmatize
 
05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
anybody but it's it's just an industry
 
05:47:58.548 --> 05:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's past its time thank you fair enough
 
05:48:03.470 --> 05:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McLean and then
 
05:48:04.970 --> 05:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
05:48:07.368 --> 05:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I just kind of
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the motion a little bit
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we had a lot of great debate
 
05:48:14.090 --> 05:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing on on both
 
05:48:16.250 --> 05:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
sides of this issue but but I want
 
05:48:19.368 --> 05:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
everybody to to remember that what this
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
is just essentially doing is building on
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
the primary care legislation that we
 
05:48:26.570 --> 05:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
passed out of this committee two terms
 
05:48:29.090 --> 05:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
ago and was passed by the entire
 
05:48:31.490 --> 05:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
legislature and I just see it as an
 
05:48:34.970 --> 05:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring real transparency
 
05:48:37.788 --> 05:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
and and real competition to the industry
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
and there were concerns
 
05:48:41.690 --> 05:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to minimize those
 
05:48:43.850 --> 05:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
concerns you know representative Murphy
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
asked a question he says well you know
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
is this cherry picking and it's
 
05:48:48.890 --> 05:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
something that some of the other folks
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted on and I'm not going to Sure
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
code it it absolutely is I mean there
 
05:48:55.850 --> 05:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
are certain patients that are going to
 
05:48:58.610 --> 05:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
gravitate towards that but just because
 
05:49:01.310 --> 05:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's the case it doesn't mean that
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's a Theta complete that the hospitals
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be denied access to those patients
 
05:49:09.890 --> 05:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
in fact what it does do is it encourages
 
05:49:13.490 --> 05:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh the hospitals to compete also another
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:49:17.570 --> 05:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
Point brought up was was by Paula
 
05:49:19.490 --> 05:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
menahan at the hospital Association and
 
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
and I agree with her statement when she
 
05:49:23.930 --> 05:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
said that the critical access uh
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals are hanging on by a threat I
 
05:49:28.490 --> 05:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
mean she's a very effective
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
um advocate for her Association and the
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is to reinforce that
 
05:49:35.208 --> 05:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
point right after that Greg Moore got up
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
from AFP and he said sends to critical
 
05:49:41.570 --> 05:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
access law passed nationally back in the
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
1990s 200 critical access hospitals have
 
05:49:49.250 --> 05:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
closed and at the core of that I don't
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
think what's driving those closures and
 
05:49:54.048 --> 05:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
what's creating that burden necessarily
 
05:49:58.430 --> 05:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
is legislation like hb69 I personally
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
believe that the the threat is coming
 
05:50:03.288 --> 05:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
from an increasing Reliance on Medicaid
 
05:50:05.330 --> 05:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
and I think there are many people that
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
that agree with that the reimbursement
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
rates are are weakened I think that
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
while Medicaid has its place and I've
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
been on social assistance in my time I
 
05:50:19.128 --> 05:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
don't think Medicaid was ever designed
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
to be a life sentence and to have the
 
05:50:24.590 --> 05:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
penetration into the Health Care
 
05:50:27.650 --> 05:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that it has right now we
 
05:50:30.288 --> 05:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
have a quarter million people in this
 
05:50:30.298 --> 05:50:31.610 align:start position:0%
have a quarter million people in this
state

05:50:31.610 --> 05:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
um on Medicaid and we're looking to grow
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
that that's one in five one in six
 
05:50:40.010 --> 05:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
people in the state and so if you look
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
back when Lakes Region Hospital went
 
05:50:45.890 --> 05:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
bankrupt the Attorney General went to
 
05:50:48.170 --> 05:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
the division of charitable trusts and
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
they asked them they said we want you
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
guys to do an audit because we want to
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
understand what happened was there you
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
know a violation of the board with
 
05:50:59.090 --> 05:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
respect to their duties and basically
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
they came back and they said there's
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
none of that I mean everybody was doing
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the right thing and maybe in the case of
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region there were some decisions
 
05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
that were made in hindsight maybe
 
05:51:11.208 --> 05:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been made but one of the
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
things that came out to me when I was
 
05:51:16.010 --> 05:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
reading through that report was the
 
05:51:19.730 --> 05:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
assertion by the CFO at that time that
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
the hospital had an over-reliance on
 
05:51:25.250 --> 05:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid with this lower reimbursement
 
05:51:28.368 --> 05:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
rates and that that was a model that was
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
going to lose the hospital millions of
 
05:51:32.990 --> 05:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and then it was not going
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
to be sustainable so I don't think that
 
05:51:36.600 --> 05:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
to be sustainable so I don't think that
HB

05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:51:42.288 --> 05:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
69 is is the problem that is going to
 
05:51:44.330 --> 05:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
break the back of the Health Care system
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
um I think if it does and it just
 
05:51:50.208 --> 05:51:50.218 align:start position:0%
highlights the the weakness of the
 
05:51:52.368 --> 05:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
system I think it's part of the solution
 
05:51:55.128 --> 05:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
actually by opening the states up
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
um to new modes of delivery one of the
 
05:52:01.010 --> 05:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
comments that Miss minahan also said was
 
05:52:03.770 --> 05:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
hey you know the hospital Association is
 
05:52:07.250 --> 05:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
very open to having new people come in
 
05:52:10.250 --> 05:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
and but all that we ask is that they
 
05:52:13.250 --> 05:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
play by the rules but I propose that the
 
05:52:15.530 --> 05:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
rules really are a part of the problem
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
and that is why we have not had a new
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
hospital in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
in 30 years so hb69 doesn't get rid of
 
05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
all the rules but it does get rid of the
 
05:52:30.410 --> 05:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
of the all-payer model and and some of
 
05:52:32.690 --> 05:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
the burden that comes with that so I
 
05:52:35.208 --> 05:52:35.218 align:start position:0%
don't see it as the end of the world
 
05:52:37.490 --> 05:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I see it as an opportunity to explore
 
05:52:39.890 --> 05:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
new loads of delivery and and I hope
 
05:52:41.868 --> 05:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
you'll support it thank you madam chair
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy
 
05:52:46.970 --> 05:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and I
 
05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
as I've mentioned before when presenting
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
a bill and I appreciate representative
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
King's you know angst with our current
 
05:52:55.970 --> 05:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
system because I also have lived in it
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
and I understand the anxieties
 
05:52:59.628 --> 05:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
associated with it having said that and
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
I've said before we don't have a health
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
care crisis we have some great health
 
05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
care providers in the state taking care
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
of our patients we do have an
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
operational and systemic wide you know
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
um uh administrative you know difficulty
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
with medicine but a bill like this is
 
05:53:13.920 --> 05:53:14.810 align:start position:0%
with medicine but a bill like this is
really

05:53:14.810 --> 05:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:53:17.208 --> 05:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
very important from a theoretical but
 
05:53:19.628 --> 05:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
also from a very practical point of view
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of unintended
 
05:53:23.448 --> 05:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
consequences one of them is as
 
05:53:25.490 --> 05:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative McLean mentioned in Paula
 
05:53:25.500 --> 05:53:26.628 align:start position:0%
representative McLean mentioned in Paula
minihan

05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
minihan
 
05:53:29.690 --> 05:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
is that this will be a Death Note for
 
05:53:31.610 --> 05:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
small Community Hospitals and it has
 
05:53:31.620 --> 05:53:32.390 align:start position:0%
small Community Hospitals and it has
been

05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
so for instance if you are a small
 
05:53:36.770 --> 05:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
community hospital and you have a margin
 
05:53:38.990 --> 05:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
of less than one percent everybody is
 
05:53:40.490 --> 05:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
breaking out the champagne they're so
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
happy that they got a positive margin of
 
05:53:44.330 --> 05:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
one percent unlike the insurance
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
industry that may get up to about 20 or
 
05:53:46.680 --> 05:53:47.750 align:start position:0%
industry that may get up to about 20 or
whatever

05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:53:49.970 --> 05:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
to get a positive margin in a critical
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
access hospital is extremely difficult
 
05:53:54.770 --> 05:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
they have to take care of everybody at a
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
critical house one of the requisites
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
is that the emergency room has to be
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
open 24 7.
 
05:54:04.490 --> 05:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
these private you know uh these private
 
05:54:07.368 --> 05:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
businesses that take cash only you can't
 
05:54:09.288 --> 05:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
call them up at midnight with your sick
 
05:54:11.810 --> 05:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
child and take them to see them because
 
05:54:13.970 --> 05:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're just not available they are
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
private practice and what that does is
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
that they have to go to the emergency
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
room of the critical access hospitals
 
05:54:22.730 --> 05:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
which have to staff at 24 7 and as a
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
result they are now essentially cherry
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
picking as was mentioned if you have a
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
similar situation where you have a
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
freestanding MRI unit your hospital may
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
not be able to if they drain that
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
resource away that income that comes in
 
05:54:39.770 --> 05:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
to a critical assets also or even
 
05:54:41.690 --> 05:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock you know these are
 
05:54:43.368 --> 05:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
Big Ticket items that they need to keep
 
05:54:45.890 --> 05:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
the business afloat unintended
 
05:54:48.048 --> 05:54:48.058 align:start position:0%
consequences you can pay more in one of
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
these facilities as a result you're
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
going to siphon off some of the
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
workforce that's already at a critical
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
shortage in a lot of these small
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the big hospitals the
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
other part of it is that this payment
 
05:55:00.470 --> 05:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they put forward doesn't go to
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
their deductible so indirectly when all
 
05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
of a sudden the patient needs something
 
05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
a bit more
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
um involved more tertiary care they then
 
05:55:11.570 --> 05:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
have to Pony up their deductible again
 
05:55:14.690 --> 05:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
so what I don't understand is yes I
 
05:55:17.090 --> 05:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
agree that the system operationally may
 
05:55:19.310 --> 05:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
have its shortcomings but this is not
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
the solution it's only a potential
 
05:55:24.650 --> 05:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
significant problem for many of the
 
05:55:26.810 --> 05:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state that are in
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
significant difficulties right now
 
05:55:29.340 --> 05:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
significant difficulties right now
um

05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:32.448 --> 05:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
in as a result of not having this
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
applied to the deductible the patient
 
05:55:36.470 --> 05:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
may then get a double whammy at the end
 
05:55:38.208 --> 05:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
they've they've paid the private you
 
05:55:40.250 --> 05:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
know business or whatever that model is
 
05:55:41.810 --> 05:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
but then when they get sick they're
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to still have to pay the
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
deductible that could have been used
 
05:55:45.948 --> 05:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise so
 
05:55:48.530 --> 05:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the frustration with the
 
05:55:50.510 --> 05:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
operational part of Health Care not the
 
05:55:53.330 --> 05:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
delivery of the professionals but I I'm
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
fully opposed to this sort of uh Bill
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:55:57.360 --> 05:55:59.868 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
kofalt

05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
kofalt
 
05:56:02.810 --> 05:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so a couple points um
 
05:56:04.730 --> 05:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
one is I think there's been a lot of
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
talk about critical access hospitals
 
05:56:12.048 --> 05:56:12.058 align:start position:0%
and you know I I guess I'm gonna
 
05:56:12.058 --> 05:56:13.010 align:start position:0%
and you know I I guess I'm gonna
um

05:56:13.010 --> 05:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
sort of frame this a little bit
 
05:56:16.250 --> 05:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
differently which is that if we allow
 
05:56:17.690 --> 05:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
pre-market Healthcare facility
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
people might choose that product because
 
05:56:23.810 --> 05:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're getting a better
 
05:56:23.820 --> 05:56:26.270 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're getting a better
value

05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.280 --> 05:56:27.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
if if the answer to the problem of
 
05:56:31.490 --> 05:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
people might choose a better product is
 
05:56:32.930 --> 05:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that product is not
 
05:56:32.940 --> 05:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that product is not
available

05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:56:38.448 --> 05:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
then the system is woefully broken
 
05:56:42.170 --> 05:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.448 --> 05:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
so if the problem is that critical
 
05:56:47.090 --> 05:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
access hospitals Community Hospitals are
 
05:56:50.090 --> 05:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
operating at very very low margins there
 
05:56:52.090 --> 05:56:52.100 align:start position:0%
is indeed a problem there
 
05:56:55.490 --> 05:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that the the solution to
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is making sure that they
 
05:56:59.150 --> 05:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any competition
 
05:57:03.170 --> 05:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
so that that concerns me greatly having
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:57:06.410 --> 05:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
I don't actually believe that this would
 
05:57:08.810 --> 05:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
create substantial competition for
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals that
 
05:57:13.250 --> 05:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
are for critical access hospitals in
 
05:57:15.230 --> 05:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
particular let's be honest what this
 
05:57:16.490 --> 05:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
would do is it would encourage
 
05:57:19.010 --> 05:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
facilities to open in the Southern Tier
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
that could either be destination
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals I think when we had the
 
05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
hearing there was some discussion of you
 
05:57:29.810 --> 05:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
know going to Thailand or Costa Rica or
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
other places for certain kinds of
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries because you know what you're
 
05:57:35.810 --> 05:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
paying getting good quality care it's a
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
fixed fee so these become either
 
05:57:38.040 --> 05:57:39.368 align:start position:0%
fixed fee so these become either
destination

05:57:39.368 --> 05:57:39.378 align:start position:0%
destination
 
05:57:42.670 --> 05:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities or they become
 
05:57:45.470 --> 05:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
sort of magnets Regional magnets that
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
would draw potentially draw patients
 
05:57:49.868 --> 05:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
from from around New England
 
05:57:52.368 --> 05:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
those sorts of facilities are probably
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
not going to open in Colossus County
 
05:57:55.440 --> 05:57:57.110 align:start position:0%
not going to open in Colossus County
okay

05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:57:57.120 --> 05:57:57.770 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:57:57.770 --> 05:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
as to the question of paying a fee and
 
05:58:03.890 --> 05:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
and then a deductible I can tell you
 
05:58:06.288 --> 05:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
that I have heard plenty of stories and
 
05:58:09.170 --> 05:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
I I think in my own family we have seen
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
this situation as well where paying out
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
of pocket
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
is cheaper than paying the deductible on
 
05:58:17.570 --> 05:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's crazy
 
05:58:22.128 --> 05:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
but it's true so when somebody says oh
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
well gee you're gonna have to pay more
 
05:58:25.788 --> 05:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
if you do direct pay I'm going to
 
05:58:27.650 --> 05:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
actually dispute that I'm going to say
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
that there are cases where you're
 
05:58:31.730 --> 05:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
actually going to pay less if you do not
 
05:58:34.368 --> 05:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
Avail yourself of your insurance if you
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the surgery center of Oklahoma which
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
is sort of the poster child for this
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
kind of free market Healthcare
 
05:58:43.200 --> 05:58:44.208 align:start position:0%
kind of free market Healthcare
um

05:58:44.208 --> 05:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
post therapy schedule online you know
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're paying
 
05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
we just don't have that kind of
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
transparency in in uh
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
in in most health care facilities
 
05:59:00.170 --> 05:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
um so you know I see this I see
 
05:59:02.810 --> 05:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as as a kind of
 
05:59:05.628 --> 05:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
protectionism for uh for for critical
 
05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
access in Community Hospitals I
 
05:59:09.410 --> 05:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a problem there
 
05:59:11.990 --> 05:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
that problem
 
05:59:15.110 --> 05:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
should be addressed I don't believe that
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
stifling Innovation is the appropriate
 
05:59:22.368 --> 05:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:24.530 --> 05:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
son of Shapiro
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
yes um I think we've um
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
we've heard talk about this hurting
 
05:59:34.250 --> 05:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
critical care hospitals and maybe some
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
would think it would be
 
05:59:39.770 --> 05:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
um hyperbole to always be kind of crying
 
05:59:41.330 --> 05:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
wolf that these hospitals are going to
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
close and
 
05:59:42.840 --> 05:59:44.330 align:start position:0%
close and
um

05:59:44.330 --> 05:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of hyperbole once in a while
 
05:59:49.970 --> 05:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
um but I think the reality is I have an
 
05:59:53.208 --> 05:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
article in front of me um you know about
 
05:59:56.208 --> 05:59:56.218 align:start position:0%
um not not only hospitals closing but
 
05:59:59.208 --> 05:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
losing certain services that are really
 
06:00:02.470 --> 06:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
important to rural areas like obstetrics
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I have an article in front of me
 
06:00:07.070 --> 06:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
that says that in the last three or four
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
years 90 89
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
my wife says I exaggerate everything so
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
I didn't get that much for going from 89
 
06:00:19.310 --> 06:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
to 90. but 89 obstetric units around the
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
country have closed and I know that's
 
06:00:23.448 --> 06:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
true I don't know if they've closed yet
 
06:00:25.250 --> 06:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
but there was one announcement that a
 
06:00:27.288 --> 06:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
frisbee Hospital in Rochester closing
 
06:00:30.110 --> 06:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
their obstetric units and I know that
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
there was a comment I think it was
 
06:00:33.770 --> 06:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative King said whenever this
 
06:00:33.780 --> 06:00:34.850 align:start position:0%
representative King said whenever this
changed

06:00:34.850 --> 06:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
changed
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
I'm paraphrasing there's disruption and
 
06:00:38.990 --> 06:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
things kind of come back to an
 
06:00:41.330 --> 06:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
equilibrium eventually
 
06:00:41.340 --> 06:00:42.350 align:start position:0%
equilibrium eventually
um

06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:44.628 --> 06:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
and you know I think there's some truth
 
06:00:46.970 --> 06:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
to that but I think we need to keep in
 
06:00:49.910 --> 06:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
mind that in the meantime this potential
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
harm to real people and
 
06:00:53.760 --> 06:00:54.890 align:start position:0%
harm to real people and
um

06:00:54.890 --> 06:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:57.410 --> 06:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
that frequently it's the poor people and
 
06:01:01.490 --> 06:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
people with less resources and um
 
06:01:05.448 --> 06:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to stifle inter in you
 
06:01:07.850 --> 06:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
know entrepreneurialism and I I don't
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
want a stifle change I think we're
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
always in the position of deciding
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
we vote Yes or we vote no and there's
 
06:01:17.208 --> 06:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
certain value to voting yes and certain
 
06:01:20.208 --> 06:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
value to voting no and
 
06:01:20.218 --> 06:01:21.590 align:start position:0%
value to voting no and
um

06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:23.690 --> 06:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no on this clearly
 
06:01:26.330 --> 06:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
because I think it it does
 
06:01:28.670 --> 06:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
create a two-tier system and it does
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
create real damage to real people
 
06:01:31.020 --> 06:01:33.288 align:start position:0%
create real damage to real people
potentially

06:01:33.288 --> 06:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
06:01:33.298 --> 06:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
potentially
um

06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:45.890 --> 06:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:47.810 --> 06:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I'm representative
 
06:01:47.820 --> 06:01:49.310 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I'm representative
Cushman

06:01:49.310 --> 06:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
Cushman
 
06:01:53.690 --> 06:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
I am very passionate about this issue
 
06:01:59.330 --> 06:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I it keeps me up at night
 
06:02:02.868 --> 06:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
um I think about it quite often and
 
06:02:04.430 --> 06:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to touch on a few of the
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
points that have been brought up
 
06:02:07.610 --> 06:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you keep going back to this word
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
cherry picking
 
06:02:09.360 --> 06:02:10.910 align:start position:0%
cherry picking
and

06:02:10.910 --> 06:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:10.920 --> 06:02:11.930 align:start position:0%
and
um

06:02:11.930 --> 06:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:14.030 --> 06:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
and and then saying that we're siphoning
 
06:02:16.670 --> 06:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
employees and there was a mention of a
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
two-tier system I would argue that we
 
06:02:21.350 --> 06:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
already have a two-tier system
 
06:02:26.510 --> 06:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
and one is the group of people who March
 
06:02:28.490 --> 06:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
to the beat of the
 
06:02:30.948 --> 06:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
um standardized American Medical system
 
06:02:36.650 --> 06:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
and there are people who do not and
 
06:02:39.650 --> 06:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
there are health care workers who have a
 
06:02:41.810 --> 06:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
different view of health and Health Care
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
also and both of those
 
06:02:48.368 --> 06:02:48.378 align:start position:0%
um groups are
 
06:02:50.208 --> 06:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by the current system
 
06:02:54.650 --> 06:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and so one example is
 
06:02:57.230 --> 06:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
mandates every hospital has to accept
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
CMS therefore you know has to engage
 
06:03:01.490 --> 06:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
with the centers for Medicare and
 
06:03:04.490 --> 06:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and and therefore they have to
 
06:03:06.350 --> 06:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
mandate coveted vaccines for their
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
employees and so disenfranchising all of
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
those employees and arguably maybe those
 
06:03:16.368 --> 06:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
employees would be feeling
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know the positions at these new
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
facilities if they didn't have that same
 
06:03:21.718 --> 06:03:23.390 align:start position:0%
facilities if they didn't have that same
mandate

06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
06:03:23.400 --> 06:03:24.048 align:start position:0%
mandate
um

06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
so potentially not siphoning but
 
06:03:29.330 --> 06:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
providing an opportunity for nurses and
 
06:03:32.030 --> 06:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
others to re-enter the workforce because
 
06:03:33.650 --> 06:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
a lot have left
 
06:03:36.048 --> 06:03:36.058 align:start position:0%
the issue with the deductibles that's
 
06:03:39.170 --> 06:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's a you know buyer beware you you
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
know that your insurance isn't covering
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
this it's not going towards your
 
06:03:43.788 --> 06:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
deductible and you're seeking this care
 
06:03:48.288 --> 06:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
for you know your own reasons and you
 
06:03:49.850 --> 06:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
know meeting your deductible is not one
 
06:03:51.288 --> 06:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
of them
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
big problem I see in the healthcare
 
06:03:56.448 --> 06:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
industry right now is that the patient
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
is not the customer the customer is the
 
06:04:01.610 --> 06:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
insurance company and the insurance
 
06:04:01.620 --> 06:04:03.048 align:start position:0%
insurance company and the insurance
company

06:04:03.048 --> 06:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
company
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the hospitals negotiate rates and
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
then insurance companies offer a
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
discount to
 
06:04:12.650 --> 06:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
services and that's what you're paying
 
06:04:15.288 --> 06:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
for when you get insurance or if you
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
enroll in Medicaid you're not paying for
 
06:04:21.048 --> 06:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
it but you know taxpayers are and you
 
06:04:22.670 --> 06:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
probably have contributed to that too at
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
some point in your life
 
06:04:24.958 --> 06:04:25.788 align:start position:0%
some point in your life
um

06:04:25.788 --> 06:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:27.770 --> 06:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is a house of cards
 
06:04:30.170 --> 06:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's one blow away from falling it's
 
06:04:32.150 --> 06:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to be insolvent the national debt
 
06:04:33.890 --> 06:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
is increasing
 
06:04:36.890 --> 06:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
more than we can even keep up with and
 
06:04:39.170 --> 06:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
faster than we can keep up with
 
06:04:39.180 --> 06:04:39.770 align:start position:0%
faster than we can keep up with
um

06:04:39.770 --> 06:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the Congressional budget office has
 
06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
been looking on how to deal with the
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
deficit and they're suggesting we reduce
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid roles and you know it's just
 
06:04:51.410 --> 06:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
the whole system is bleeding from every
 
06:04:54.350 --> 06:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
orifice and
 
06:04:57.410 --> 06:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
something needs to change this is one
 
06:05:00.650 --> 06:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
step to allow an alternative to maybe
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
come up and satisfy some of the need in
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
the market that's not satisfied
 
06:05:06.120 --> 06:05:06.830 align:start position:0%
the market that's not satisfied
um

06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
06:05:12.288 --> 06:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
if it if it proves to be effective so
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
for example and I I'll wrap up shortly
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
but to digress back to representative
 
06:05:18.120 --> 06:05:19.368 align:start position:0%
but to digress back to representative
Murphy's

06:05:19.368 --> 06:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
Murphy's
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
um concern that you know con or maybe it
 
06:05:23.570 --> 06:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
was uh representative Palmer over in
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hanover the concierge medicine you know
 
06:05:27.410 --> 06:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
not everyone can afford it and in the
 
06:05:28.430 --> 06:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
North Country they won't be able to
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
afford it and I think you're talking
 
06:05:31.850 --> 06:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
about direct Primary Care
 
06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but there is a there are
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
cheap direct primary care doctors you
 
06:05:41.868 --> 06:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
know it's sixty dollars a month for 12
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
visits and the doctor comes to your
 
06:05:46.128 --> 06:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
house at one of the direct primary cares
 
06:05:50.090 --> 06:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
and they're in the North country and so
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
I think that this is an opportunity that
 
06:05:54.288 --> 06:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
could alleviate some of the needs of
 
06:05:56.030 --> 06:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
financially struggling
 
06:06:04.610 --> 06:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
um and maybe don't want to engage in the
 
06:06:07.128 --> 06:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
current system for whatever reason or
 
06:06:10.368 --> 06:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
maybe they just see that it's a lot
 
06:06:13.368 --> 06:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
easier when your doctor has time to talk
 
06:06:15.410 --> 06:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
to you because there aren't those
 
06:06:15.420 --> 06:06:16.570 align:start position:0%
to you because there aren't those
insurance

06:06:16.570 --> 06:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:06:19.128 --> 06:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
requirements for documentation that keep
 
06:06:20.750 --> 06:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
them away from the bedside and they just
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
find that the care and the access is
 
06:06:23.160 --> 06:06:24.650 align:start position:0%
find that the care and the access is
better

06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and that there are cost benefits also
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I just think that this is something
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
that we need to offer people
 
06:06:33.708 --> 06:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
um we all admit that it's broken we
 
06:06:36.770 --> 06:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
should just give this inch and open up
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
the market a little bit
 
06:06:42.350 --> 06:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
right now who's currently in there all
 
06:06:44.090 --> 06:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
the current hospitals like it's it's
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
protect it's insulated by law
 
06:06:47.878 --> 06:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
protect it's insulated by law
and

06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:52.430 --> 06:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
there is opportunity for alternatives to
 
06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
come up and help alleviate some of the
 
06:06:57.530 --> 06:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
stress and I just hope that you guys can
 
06:07:00.830 --> 06:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.170 --> 06:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
06:07:06.170 --> 06:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering I don't think any of
 
06:07:08.330 --> 06:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
us are going to change our minds here
 
06:07:11.628 --> 06:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
and I think we're getting well into the
 
06:07:16.190 --> 06:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
weeds of the much more Global issues of
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system and government
 
06:07:22.850 --> 06:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
operations and everything else
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and I certainly can't
 
06:07:27.368 --> 06:07:27.378 align:start position:0%
tell anybody
 
06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
not to go on talking but
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just going to express my hope
 
06:07:36.670 --> 06:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we can very soon get to a vote
 
06:07:39.470 --> 06:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I think that
 
06:07:40.850 --> 06:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
it actually goes a little further than
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
that as some people see that this
 
06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
actually is a solution to some of those
 
06:07:47.628 --> 06:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
macroeconomic issues but I do agree that
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
this discussion while has been very
 
06:07:50.510 --> 06:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
informative I'm not sure that it's
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
changed many Minds
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and we probably should be filling up
 
06:07:56.330 --> 06:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
the papers with op-eds but I will
 
06:07:58.010 --> 06:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
recognize that Representatives at the
 
06:07:59.330 --> 06:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
king and then after that it will call
 
06:08:00.650 --> 06:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
the roll I think that's all right thank
 
06:08:01.970 --> 06:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to make a couple
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
extra points
 
06:08:04.730 --> 06:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
um sorry and if I can just say just make
 
06:08:06.890 --> 06:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
sure that you keep kindness in mind with
 
06:08:08.930 --> 06:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
your words yeah it'll be short
 
06:08:08.940 --> 06:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
your words yeah it'll be short
um

06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:12.530 --> 06:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I would just ask people what is the
 
06:08:15.170 --> 06:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
conservative position the conservative
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
position is to maintain the status quo
 
06:08:19.970 --> 06:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
the liberal position the progressive
 
06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
position is to do something new that's a
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
forward thinking and then also
 
06:08:28.850 --> 06:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
um to address some of Murphy's
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's concern sorry
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative sorry representative
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
Murphy's concerns
 
06:08:39.650 --> 06:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
um which are valid concerns that there
 
06:08:40.970 --> 06:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
are certain money makers for the
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals like MRIs and there are other
 
06:08:45.470 --> 06:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
things that cost them money and if
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
people are cherry picking and only
 
06:08:48.770 --> 06:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
building MRI machines in private
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
facilities that the system could go
 
06:08:53.330 --> 06:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
bankrupt it's a valid concern but I just
 
06:08:54.910 --> 06:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
want to mention a couple other things
 
06:08:57.970 --> 06:08:57.980 align:start position:0%
that in a more free market setting
 
06:09:00.170 --> 06:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
actually works all the time so for
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
example gas stations they don't really
 
06:09:03.890 --> 06:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
make their money from selling cash they
 
06:09:06.170 --> 06:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
make it from selling concessions movie
 
06:09:07.610 --> 06:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
theaters they don't make money from
 
06:09:10.250 --> 06:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
selling movie tickets jobs they make it
 
06:09:12.288 --> 06:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
from concessions Las Vegas as a whole
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
they don't make their money from shows
 
06:09:19.368 --> 06:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
and magic and theaters and stuff like
 
06:09:21.288 --> 06:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
that they make it from the gambling so
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is totally reasonable that
 
06:09:24.240 --> 06:09:24.850 align:start position:0%
it is totally reasonable that
um

06:09:24.850 --> 06:09:24.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:29.948 --> 06:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
that uh private private hospitals
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
can end up picking up the slack if
 
06:09:36.110 --> 06:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetically the critical access care
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals did go under that the Private
 
06:09:40.010 --> 06:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
health care facilities would very much
 
06:09:43.810 --> 06:09:43.820 align:start position:0%
pick up those so-called losing
 
06:09:47.090 --> 06:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
losing operations operations that cost
 
06:09:48.530 --> 06:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
the money they'll pick it up anyways
 
06:09:49.970 --> 06:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
because they want to gain the customers
 
06:09:51.530 --> 06:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
and they might actually be able to make
 
06:09:54.048 --> 06:09:54.058 align:start position:0%
a profit on those things so I I think
 
06:09:57.770 --> 06:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
the the the the the short-term concerns
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
are real but
 
06:10:00.000 --> 06:10:00.650 align:start position:0%
are real but
um

06:10:00.650 --> 06:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:03.048 --> 06:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
if you have faith in people and the free
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
market and that people will supply a
 
06:10:09.350 --> 06:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
demand then there's no reason to
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
long-term worry about this and and I and
 
06:10:12.650 --> 06:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate the fact you gave me
 
06:10:14.810 --> 06:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
another word on this because we have a
 
06:10:16.250 --> 06:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
chance to actually make or some real
 
06:10:19.610 --> 06:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
change here we honestly with just a
 
06:10:22.010 --> 06:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
couple of democrat votes this this could
 
06:10:24.288 --> 06:10:24.298 align:start position:0%
change how health care is done in this
 
06:10:26.690 --> 06:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
state and so I'm asking at least some
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats to switch over and I think it
 
06:10:29.810 --> 06:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe not in this committee but maybe at
 
06:10:34.128 --> 06:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
large because this is
 
06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
this is a very important issue and we
 
06:10:37.730 --> 06:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
could make a lot of strides for actually
 
06:10:40.250 --> 06:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
providing real Health Care to people in
 
06:10:43.610 --> 06:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
need thank you thank you and with that
 
06:10:45.708 --> 06:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the role on
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%

required to do another vote on itl and
 
06:11:57.650 --> 06:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
have that fail as well or can we just go
 
06:11:59.628 --> 06:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead and say that the motion has
 
06:12:01.128 --> 06:12:01.138 align:start position:0%
failed and that there'll be a minority
 
06:12:04.128 --> 06:12:04.138 align:start position:0%

magically change their numbers
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
we can save the two minutes so if we
 
06:12:15.770 --> 06:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
just do the do the two statements on a
 
06:12:17.288 --> 06:12:17.298 align:start position:0%

up is House Bill 323 I'm going to
 
06:14:30.650 --> 06:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
distribute an amendment and I think that
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
we should take another be back at
 
06:14:38.750 --> 06:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
um 3 29 3 30 so that we can read through
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
this as well because it does have some
 
06:14:42.170 --> 06:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
rewrite to it and it was sent out last
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
night and we can take care of our
 
06:14:45.770 --> 06:14:45.780 align:start position:0%

06:14:57.660 --> 06:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:15:03.540 --> 06:15:03.550 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:03.550 --> 06:15:08.690 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:15:08.690 --> 06:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:10.910 --> 06:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
and we won't be going past five o'clock
 
06:15:13.250 --> 06:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
we're at eight so we want to try and
 
06:15:14.690 --> 06:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not required to
 
06:15:18.048 --> 06:15:18.058 align:start position:0%
come in on Monday all right
 
06:15:19.610 --> 06:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I'll be comfortable if we get through
 
06:15:22.368 --> 06:15:22.378 align:start position:0%
at least 12 or 13 but we delayed some of
 
06:15:23.990 --> 06:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
the long ones so let's try and get to at
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
I think that's oh that's fantastic well
 
06:15:51.310 --> 06:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.390 --> 06:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
what's it called again when you can't
 
06:15:56.470 --> 06:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
make your decision it's no decision
 
06:36:46.430 --> 06:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:49.610 --> 06:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you and welcome back
 
06:36:52.970 --> 06:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
um we are going to open up uh I'm going
 
06:36:55.730 --> 06:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
to open up the executive session on
 
06:36:58.850 --> 06:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 323 relative to establishing
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
a committee on emerging medical
 
06:37:00.120 --> 06:37:01.850 align:start position:0%
a committee on emerging medical
Technologies

06:37:01.850 --> 06:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
06:37:03.230 --> 06:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I think it'd be most appropriate for
 
06:37:05.150 --> 06:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
me to move the amendment
 
06:37:06.830 --> 06:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and then we can discuss it would that
 
06:37:08.690 --> 06:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
be the right procedure
 
06:37:10.910 --> 06:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I always just
 
06:37:12.670 --> 06:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
discussed it before moving it
 
06:37:15.170 --> 06:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
particularly when I there were thoughts
 
06:37:19.490 --> 06:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
of needing to amend it but okay then I
 
06:37:21.350 --> 06:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
will defer to your I will defer to your
 
06:37:23.330 --> 06:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
experience thank you
 
06:37:23.340 --> 06:37:23.930 align:start position:0%
experience thank you
um

06:37:23.930 --> 06:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:26.270 --> 06:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
seems that I may have passed out my copy
 
06:37:29.690 --> 06:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
of this but our thank you very much so
 
06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
when we discuss this emerging medical
 
06:37:34.670 --> 06:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies committee
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
um quite obviously this came about from
 
06:37:39.530 --> 06:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
our late departed friend Catherine
 
06:37:39.540 --> 06:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
our late departed friend Catherine
Rogers

06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
Rogers
 
06:37:44.628 --> 06:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
um I I failed in not including that in
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
the rewrite of it because obviously
 
06:37:48.590 --> 06:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
she's somebody we want to honor and
 
06:37:49.548 --> 06:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
that's something that we would
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely want to include going forward
 
06:37:55.250 --> 06:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
um my background is an implantable
 
06:37:57.110 --> 06:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
medical devices and my husband's is in
 
06:38:00.470 --> 06:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
cancer research so I also automatically
 
06:38:02.750 --> 06:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
assume that biomarkers for cancer would
 
06:38:05.090 --> 06:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
be one of the topics of this and in
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
drafting the amendment I failed to
 
06:38:10.430 --> 06:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
include biomarkers in there as well so
 
06:38:12.590 --> 06:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
my intention would be to redraft this
 
06:38:15.770 --> 06:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
amendment with reference to our our dear
 
06:38:18.890 --> 06:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
departed Catherine Rogers and also to
 
06:38:21.590 --> 06:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
include biomarkers within this
 
06:38:21.600 --> 06:38:23.090 align:start position:0%
include biomarkers within this
um

06:38:23.090 --> 06:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
so those so if we were to look at this
 
06:38:27.708 --> 06:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
through the lens where those are
 
06:38:30.288 --> 06:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
included in this amendment I want to
 
06:38:32.990 --> 06:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
talk through why these changes have been
 
06:38:36.048 --> 06:38:36.058 align:start position:0%
made and why I think that this would be
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
a more effective committee I guess one
 
06:38:42.110 --> 06:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
other note representative Weber has also
 
06:38:44.810 --> 06:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
made made mention that the committee
 
06:38:46.910 --> 06:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
members that they should be appointed
 
06:38:48.288 --> 06:38:48.298 align:start position:0%
one by the speaker and one by the
 
06:38:49.970 --> 06:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
minority leader and the same for the
 
06:38:51.830 --> 06:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
alternates and I think that that is a
 
06:38:53.390 --> 06:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
great idea it's better than specifying
 
06:38:55.070 --> 06:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
members as as part of the parties
 
06:38:57.650 --> 06:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
because we may have a scenario where one
 
06:38:59.330 --> 06:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
party has the people who should be on
 
06:39:00.530 --> 06:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
the committee and if there's agreement
 
06:39:01.970 --> 06:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
between the speaker and the minority
 
06:39:01.980 --> 06:39:02.990 align:start position:0%
between the speaker and the minority
leader

06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
leader
 
06:39:05.208 --> 06:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
I love it when there's agreement so that
 
06:39:07.670 --> 06:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
we should leave that option open
 
06:39:11.030 --> 06:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
so by narrowing down this committee it's
 
06:39:12.410 --> 06:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
so that it can be more targeted about
 
06:39:14.690 --> 06:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
what's going on it can still bring in
 
06:39:16.788 --> 06:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
all of those resources all of those
 
06:39:18.410 --> 06:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
stakeholders all of those committee
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
groups that are relevant to the topic at
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
hand this this was brought in
 
06:39:26.810 --> 06:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
specifically looking to biomarkers but
 
06:39:29.090 --> 06:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
frankly emerging medical technology is a
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
lot broader than that and in our hearing
 
06:39:32.810 --> 06:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
we did have discussion of that
 
06:39:35.570 --> 06:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
um right now there's a big move to move
 
06:39:37.250 --> 06:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
clinical research out of just the
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and also into Community
 
06:39:40.430 --> 06:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
settings which is quite fortunate for us
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
because Dartmouth is a fantastic
 
06:39:44.930 --> 06:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
academic center but that has been our
 
06:39:46.970 --> 06:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
main location for clinical research and
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of clinical research that
 
06:39:50.150 --> 06:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
they've been doing has decreased in
 
06:39:52.430 --> 06:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
recent years just because of all the
 
06:39:53.690 --> 06:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
different issues that are going on in
 
06:39:55.548 --> 06:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
the world by
 
06:39:57.530 --> 06:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
having one of the charges of the
 
06:39:59.628 --> 06:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
emerging medical the emerging medical
 
06:40:02.270 --> 06:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
Technologies committee expanding access
 
06:40:04.368 --> 06:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
to clinical trials in both academic and
 
06:40:06.530 --> 06:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
Community settings that would be a way
 
06:40:07.850 --> 06:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to reduce whatever
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
barriers we have perhaps see if
 
06:40:14.390 --> 06:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
see see how we can make sure that they
 
06:40:17.570 --> 06:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
have the right review irbs in place the
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
institutional review boards everything
 
06:40:20.628 --> 06:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
else that's necessary in order to bring
 
06:40:22.670 --> 06:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
these to Market if this is already
 
06:40:24.830 --> 06:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
handled by Private Industry all the
 
06:40:26.628 --> 06:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
better but if there's some hurdles where
 
06:40:28.910 --> 06:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
we need to be a go-between then this
 
06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be a committee that would have
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that option of serving as a go-between
 
06:40:34.010 --> 06:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
in order to either talk to departments
 
06:40:37.250 --> 06:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
talk to boards talk to Commissioners
 
06:40:39.650 --> 06:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
talk to other stakeholders and see if we
 
06:40:42.048 --> 06:40:42.058 align:start position:0%
can find a solution before we get to a
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative one but still have that
 
06:40:45.890 --> 06:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
option open to us
 
06:40:47.690 --> 06:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
a large part of bringing emerging
 
06:40:51.048 --> 06:40:51.058 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies you know we talked
 
06:40:52.610 --> 06:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
about cherry picking I also talk about
 
06:40:54.708 --> 06:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
early adopters quite frankly early
 
06:40:58.250 --> 06:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
adopters are the ones that that Finance
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
Innovation for everybody else behind
 
06:41:02.270 --> 06:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
them it's a little bit tough when you're
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
looking at these high cost high-class
 
06:41:08.750 --> 06:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
new new technologies but we also want to
 
06:41:10.368 --> 06:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's Compassionate
 
06:41:12.288 --> 06:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
Care programs as well and that's one of
 
06:41:14.448 --> 06:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
the things that recently the FDA through
 
06:41:16.128 --> 06:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
some of the rulemaking changes have
 
06:41:17.510 --> 06:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
largely shut down a lot of the
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care that used to be
 
06:41:22.490 --> 06:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
offered by the pharmaceutical industry I
 
06:41:23.930 --> 06:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can necessarily
 
06:41:26.030 --> 06:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
address that but if we identify that as
 
06:41:27.770 --> 06:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
a large reason why our underserved
 
06:41:28.990 --> 06:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
communities are not getting
 
06:41:32.750 --> 06:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
compassionate access to pre-market drugs
 
06:41:35.330 --> 06:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
and drugs that would benefit them there
 
06:41:36.530 --> 06:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
would be more standing for this
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee to bring others in in order to
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
send that appeal up through the through
 
06:41:43.730 --> 06:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
the appropriate channels to the FDA than
 
06:41:45.530 --> 06:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
just having a random group of
 
06:41:46.910 --> 06:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislators that aren't charged with
 
06:41:51.830 --> 06:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:54.590 --> 06:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
and also removing barriers because it's
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
quite possible that we have significant
 
06:41:58.548 --> 06:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
barriers both in our roles and our laws
 
06:42:00.650 --> 06:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
that are limiting some of these emerging
 
06:42:02.750 --> 06:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies but as we lift
 
06:42:04.310 --> 06:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
those barriers we also need to look at
 
06:42:06.350 --> 06:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
what happens when you lift them I was a
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
medical device analyst and I was there
 
06:42:11.150 --> 06:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
when the drug eluding stent so the
 
06:42:13.490 --> 06:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
cardiac stents started killing people
 
06:42:15.170 --> 06:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
because they were flaking off with the
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
coating nobody had expected that they
 
06:42:18.770 --> 06:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
were going to flake off so long so
 
06:42:20.690 --> 06:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
people weren't on anticoagulant therapy
 
06:42:21.770 --> 06:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
later on
 
06:42:23.930 --> 06:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
fortunately it was caught early and some
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
great Pathologists were doing work in
 
06:42:28.010 --> 06:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
order to find that I obviously would not
 
06:42:29.390 --> 06:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
say that this committee is getting into
 
06:42:31.490 --> 06:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
pathology or anything else but looking
 
06:42:34.010 --> 06:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
to see who else has some information if
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
we're starting to hear problems of
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
people in our state harmed by some
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
technology that it may be in a position
 
06:42:44.570 --> 06:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
to ask questions I'd say not even 99 out
 
06:42:47.570 --> 06:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
of 100 times but 999 out of a thousand
 
06:42:49.788 --> 06:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
times there may not be a role but
 
06:42:52.610 --> 06:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
charging this com this committee with
 
06:42:54.530 --> 06:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do that in that one
 
06:42:56.150 --> 06:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
in a thousand or one in ten thousand
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
chance could have a major impact on the
 
06:43:00.048 --> 06:43:00.058 align:start position:0%
health of granite Staters so including
 
06:43:01.910 --> 06:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
that within the scope I think would be
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable and helpful
 
06:43:07.128 --> 06:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
I I also know of the risks of
 
06:43:09.830 --> 06:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
implantable devices and how sometimes
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
the way that that's adopted it may need
 
06:43:14.990 --> 06:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more guidance from the
 
06:43:17.448 --> 06:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and other and and
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
other overseers in order to make sure
 
06:43:22.128 --> 06:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
that those who are adopting this new
 
06:43:24.830 --> 06:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
technology are doing so with the right
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
level of training right level of
 
06:43:29.150 --> 06:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledging of what's coming out of
 
06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
these device manufacturers who send
 
06:43:33.170 --> 06:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
representatives to help make sure that
 
06:43:35.810 --> 06:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
they're implanted correctly as an
 
06:43:37.070 --> 06:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
analyst there were plenty of devices
 
06:43:38.810 --> 06:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
that had to be redesigned so that they
 
06:43:41.390 --> 06:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be implanted incorrectly
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
and if we see if we end up seeing that
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire it would be good
 
06:43:47.570 --> 06:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
to to to be able to be an early warning
 
06:43:49.610 --> 06:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
system if there is suddenly an increase
 
06:43:52.128 --> 06:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
in more morbidity or mortality that is
 
06:43:55.368 --> 06:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
seen in any of these I reck by being
 
06:43:57.230 --> 06:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
separate from it
 
06:43:58.730 --> 06:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
um this gives us a bit of an opportunity
 
06:44:01.970 --> 06:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
where we're not captive to the whole to
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
the whole hierarchy
 
06:44:05.090 --> 06:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
and it's good to be able to have an
 
06:44:07.310 --> 06:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
outside voice because you don't it's
 
06:44:10.190 --> 06:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
very hard for people to raise a concern
 
06:44:13.310 --> 06:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
about somebody's senior to them and
 
06:44:15.110 --> 06:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
while this hopefully is never used
 
06:44:17.390 --> 06:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
having this Avenue would be a way to
 
06:44:19.850 --> 06:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
help protect the health of citizens of
 
06:44:20.930 --> 06:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:44:23.570 --> 06:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
and that would be the signal say the the
 
06:44:25.850 --> 06:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
available safety signals
 
06:44:29.150 --> 06:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I know that if you aren't involved
 
06:44:31.368 --> 06:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
um in this area that term safety signal
 
06:44:33.288 --> 06:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
seems a little bit odd but for those who
 
06:44:35.330 --> 06:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
understand looking at clinical data and
 
06:44:37.670 --> 06:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
The Real World experience and and that
 
06:44:39.048 --> 06:44:39.058 align:start position:0%
information that comes around you can't
 
06:44:41.390 --> 06:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
Define what a safety signal is but when
 
06:44:43.128 --> 06:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
suddenly you get outcomes that are
 
06:44:45.530 --> 06:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
unexpected uh generally there is a
 
06:44:47.650 --> 06:44:47.660 align:start position:0%
signal that you can find
 
06:44:51.368 --> 06:44:51.378 align:start position:0%
and it's quite possible that we could
 
06:44:53.868 --> 06:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
strike section three which is lines six
 
06:44:55.250 --> 06:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
and seven on the back page about
 
06:44:57.650 --> 06:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
refueling the appropriate non-disclosure
 
06:44:57.660 --> 06:44:59.690 align:start position:0%
refueling the appropriate non-disclosure
causes

06:44:59.690 --> 06:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
causes
 
06:45:02.330 --> 06:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern there was just that
 
06:45:04.730 --> 06:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
we had the experience
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
um with with the Manchester the
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester experience and if people are
 
06:45:12.170 --> 06:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
being unable to speak about what has
 
06:45:14.810 --> 06:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
gone wrong and then they're unable to
 
06:45:17.570 --> 06:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
discuss the problems that it may mean
 
06:45:20.270 --> 06:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that help doesn't come for the next
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
person who would be injured so that was
 
06:45:24.770 --> 06:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
my intention including that line if
 
06:45:27.170 --> 06:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
those two lines are too problematic I'm
 
06:45:30.230 --> 06:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not wedded to them but I I did think
 
06:45:32.448 --> 06:45:32.458 align:start position:0%
that it was was reasonable to make sure
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that these agreements aren't prevent
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
preventing us from preventing harm to
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
others in the future
 
06:45:40.970 --> 06:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that was actually one of the things
 
06:45:42.770 --> 06:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
that was in the one of the Board of
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
Medicine charges I believe in the longer
 
06:45:47.810 --> 06:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
committee was talking about that um
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
and it is one of those issues that we
 
06:45:51.948 --> 06:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that everything is
 
06:45:53.930 --> 06:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
balanced appropriately
 
06:45:55.368 --> 06:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
and then studying the barriers to
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
expanding the presence of emerging
 
06:45:58.490 --> 06:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
medical technology companies and their
 
06:46:01.310 --> 06:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
suppliers in New Hampshire right now we
 
06:46:04.730 --> 06:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
have absolutely Cutting Edge drug device
 
06:46:07.970 --> 06:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
combination with Army in Manchester
 
06:46:09.770 --> 06:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
um that place I love the advanced
 
06:46:12.530 --> 06:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
regenerative medicine Institute and
 
06:46:14.390 --> 06:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing groundbreaking work in
 
06:46:16.128 --> 06:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
bringing cells and Scaffolding and
 
06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
signals in order to grow new tissues in
 
06:46:19.090 --> 06:46:19.100 align:start position:0%
new organs
 
06:46:21.890 --> 06:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
we at times had had more manufacturing
 
06:46:23.690 --> 06:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
for some of the device companies here in
 
06:46:25.670 --> 06:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but that has moved out of
 
06:46:27.708 --> 06:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
state and my friends that have worked at
 
06:46:29.208 --> 06:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
those have moved on to other Industries
 
06:46:31.610 --> 06:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
I would like to see if there is a way
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we can encourage some of these
 
06:46:35.048 --> 06:46:35.058 align:start position:0%
industries to come back to New Hampshire
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
and that would be fantastic for our
 
06:46:40.010 --> 06:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
people because these are generally high
 
06:46:42.048 --> 06:46:42.058 align:start position:0%
paying jobs and then other issues
 
06:46:43.610 --> 06:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
surrounding emerging Medical Technology
 
06:46:45.048 --> 06:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a committee
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that their hands aren't
 
06:46:48.230 --> 06:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
tied that they can't get into something
 
06:46:50.448 --> 06:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
else because we don't know what the next
 
06:46:54.170 --> 06:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:56.750 --> 06:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
and obviously as legislators making
 
06:46:58.548 --> 06:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations regarding
 
06:47:01.010 --> 06:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
legislation or investigation would be
 
06:47:03.770 --> 06:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
one of those areas where we would be you
 
06:47:05.330 --> 06:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
would hope that if legislation is needed
 
06:47:06.650 --> 06:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
that this committee could actually draft
 
06:47:09.230 --> 06:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislation as that committee
 
06:47:11.330 --> 06:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
so this only needs to meet once a year
 
06:47:14.570 --> 06:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
and it is a very large broad charging
 
06:47:16.670 --> 06:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
but when there is a need it would be
 
06:47:18.830 --> 06:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
able to come together mobilize and do
 
06:47:22.128 --> 06:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
this if we look at my oversight on
 
06:47:24.350 --> 06:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
biomarkers then we can bring that back
 
06:47:26.090 --> 06:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
in and that's a discussion that needs to
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
be had right now because we have
 
06:47:29.990 --> 06:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
biomarkers there's some that are still
 
06:47:32.390 --> 06:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
only at the pre-clinical level looking
 
06:47:34.910 --> 06:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
to biomarkers was part of the reason to
 
06:47:36.590 --> 06:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
add access to clinical trials because
 
06:47:38.270 --> 06:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
until we have enough clinical research
 
06:47:39.830 --> 06:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
going on especially in the community
 
06:47:41.750 --> 06:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
setting it's hard to know which
 
06:47:44.750 --> 06:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
biomarkers prove most efficacious and
 
06:47:46.670 --> 06:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
most beneficial and some biomarkers are
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually a signal not to use a drug so
 
06:47:50.330 --> 06:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're very very important and the more
 
06:47:52.610 --> 06:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
data and research the better so this
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
overall dovetails to bring this all
 
06:47:56.690 --> 06:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
together so that they can attack that
 
06:47:58.968 --> 06:47:58.978 align:start position:0%
issue but they're also able to deal with
 
06:48:01.310 --> 06:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
other issues that could be helpful this
 
06:48:03.170 --> 06:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
past summer we were a little hamstrung
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
about what to do with all of the
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
breaking news and this would have been
 
06:48:09.230 --> 06:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
one way to ask some questions
 
06:48:12.468 --> 06:48:12.478 align:start position:0%
so representative Weber
 
06:48:14.270 --> 06:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for going through that so
 
06:48:16.190 --> 06:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
thoroughly because it's really brought
 
06:48:19.910 --> 06:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
me several other questions
 
06:48:23.810 --> 06:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
um if we have a committee composed of
 
06:48:25.490 --> 06:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
three people
 
06:48:29.690 --> 06:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.730 --> 06:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
boy is that going to be a heck of a
 
06:48:31.740 --> 06:48:32.468 align:start position:0%
boy is that going to be a heck of a
meeting

06:48:32.468 --> 06:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:48:37.490 --> 06:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
because we have given them
 
06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually I I I don't think that any of
 
06:48:42.468 --> 06:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
the things that you've added here were
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily precluded by the other
 
06:48:45.360 --> 06:48:47.410 align:start position:0%
necessarily precluded by the other
formulation

06:48:47.410 --> 06:48:47.420 align:start position:0%
formulation
 
06:48:50.570 --> 06:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I think that it all of this could be
 
06:48:53.208 --> 06:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
studied under the first formulation
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm beginning to think that maybe
 
06:48:58.010 --> 06:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
saying that it's going to meet once a
 
06:49:00.110 --> 06:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
year is
 
06:49:02.690 --> 06:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
so that's at least once a year not just
 
06:49:06.948 --> 06:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
once yeah I I get it but still in all
 
06:49:09.650 --> 06:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
um as as somebody who has been involved
 
06:49:12.250 --> 06:49:12.260 align:start position:0%
twice in committees to remove committees
 
06:49:15.830 --> 06:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
that have not been particularly useful
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
committees and I I do understand that
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's entirely a function of who
 
06:49:22.250 --> 06:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
gets appointed to the committee and how
 
06:49:25.368 --> 06:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
proactive they are so in that respect
 
06:49:26.930 --> 06:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly the way the original
 
06:49:30.708 --> 06:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
bill was written and the original bill
 
06:49:30.718 --> 06:49:32.570 align:start position:0%
bill was written and the original bill
had

06:49:32.570 --> 06:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:49:35.570 --> 06:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
the potential for having as much stuff
 
06:49:37.310 --> 06:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
in it I just I just bring that to
 
06:49:40.968 --> 06:49:40.978 align:start position:0%
people's attention uh my only concern is
 
06:49:46.490 --> 06:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
that you know this is a lot to chew and
 
06:49:48.170 --> 06:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
um maybe the committee will pick and
 
06:49:52.250 --> 06:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
choose but it's a lot to chew on
 
06:49:56.030 --> 06:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
um as as currently drafted and it's
 
06:49:58.788 --> 06:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
more of a mandate for all the extra
 
06:49:58.798 --> 06:49:59.708 align:start position:0%
more of a mandate for all the extra
things

06:49:59.708 --> 06:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:50:02.810 --> 06:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
than the original language of the bill
 
06:50:02.820 --> 06:50:05.390 align:start position:0%
than the original language of the bill
had

06:50:05.390 --> 06:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
I just I'm just signaling that as a
 
06:50:08.760 --> 06:50:09.530 align:start position:0%
I just I'm just signaling that as a
thought

06:50:09.530 --> 06:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:50:11.628 --> 06:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you what a change of the word
 
06:50:14.570 --> 06:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
shout to May on line 23 get to that real
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
intention that these are all options to
 
06:50:19.670 --> 06:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
the committee but not mandates
 
06:50:22.010 --> 06:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
06:50:24.250 --> 06:50:24.260 align:start position:0%
would be prudent
 
06:50:25.968 --> 06:50:25.978 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:50:25.978 --> 06:50:27.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:29.510 --> 06:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then representative Shapiro
 
06:50:31.968 --> 06:50:31.978 align:start position:0%
yeah I hope you'll indulge my ignorance
 
06:50:34.448 --> 06:50:34.458 align:start position:0%
about this whole area you talked about
 
06:50:36.650 --> 06:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care and how there was
 
06:50:39.010 --> 06:50:39.020 align:start position:0%
less of that than there used to be
 
06:50:41.770 --> 06:50:41.780 align:start position:0%
in clinical trials for medications
 
06:50:44.690 --> 06:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
aren't those generally
 
06:50:49.128 --> 06:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
paid for by the the drug companies that
 
06:50:51.468 --> 06:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
are doing the clinical trials or were
 
06:50:53.208 --> 06:50:53.218 align:start position:0%
you referring to something else thank
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
you during the clinical trial it's paid
 
06:50:56.810 --> 06:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
for by the drug manufacturer but there's
 
06:50:58.310 --> 06:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
a time frame between when the clinical
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
trial ends and then when it'll be
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
approved and especially when you're
 
06:51:04.250 --> 06:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
looking at drugs for terminal diseases
 
06:51:06.048 --> 06:51:06.058 align:start position:0%
or if you're looking at orphan
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
indications there may be some where I've
 
06:51:10.368 --> 06:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
known of some drugs that are in
 
06:51:11.810 --> 06:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
development that only five or six people
 
06:51:14.090 --> 06:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
have a specific need and there are data
 
06:51:16.788 --> 06:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
to show that the overwhelming benefit
 
06:51:18.410 --> 06:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
would be to offer it to this terminal
 
06:51:20.810 --> 06:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
child but the way that the FDA rules
 
06:51:22.610 --> 06:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
have been written it precludes some of
 
06:51:25.850 --> 06:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
that so this compassionate use is not in
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
the in the clinical trials and it's one
 
06:51:29.628 --> 06:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
of those where the drug companies do
 
06:51:31.430 --> 06:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to provide it they've simply been
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing that and so we can
 
06:51:35.628 --> 06:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
come to them not from the people looking
 
06:51:37.250 --> 06:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
to make all the money but the people
 
06:51:39.650 --> 06:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
looking to serve the people in our state
 
06:51:41.570 --> 06:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
and it'll be a different voice that may
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
be more efficacious I see thank you and
 
06:51:48.288 --> 06:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:50.448 --> 06:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
um second to the last line section two
 
06:51:53.390 --> 06:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
of this actual take effect October 1st
 
06:51:56.390 --> 06:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
2028 that's so that's the repeal of the
 
06:51:59.628 --> 06:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
ACT that's the end yes um so we're
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill this committee
 
06:52:05.330 --> 06:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
meeting for four or five years and then
 
06:52:08.448 --> 06:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
making a decision about whether to re-up
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay good yeah so it will not be a
 
06:52:12.830 --> 06:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
phantom committee 20 years in the future
 
06:52:15.288 --> 06:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you representative
 
06:52:17.868 --> 06:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
Palmer yeah I was just looking and you
 
06:52:20.448 --> 06:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
were talking about adding in the um
 
06:52:23.208 --> 06:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
biomarkers and I'm just wondering if you
 
06:52:25.850 --> 06:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
want to leave it more General so that
 
06:52:27.830 --> 06:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
not only biomarkers but whatever else
 
06:52:29.990 --> 06:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
comes up that we aren't aware of now
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
could be
 
06:52:33.288 --> 06:52:33.298 align:start position:0%
included I mean there was just listening
 
06:52:35.330 --> 06:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
to the whole thing about crispr and the
 
06:52:37.850 --> 06:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
first woman who's been cured of sickle
 
06:52:40.070 --> 06:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
cell and you know so there's another one
 
06:52:41.570 --> 06:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
not that there probably is a lot of
 
06:52:43.368 --> 06:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
sickle cell in New Hampshire but you
 
06:52:45.468 --> 06:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
know what's the next thing going to be
 
06:52:47.090 --> 06:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you we do have it and it's not
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
huge but we do have sickle cell here
 
06:52:50.990 --> 06:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so the reason why I thought that
 
06:52:52.430 --> 06:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
biomarkers would already be well
 
06:52:55.010 --> 06:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
included is because we do have other
 
06:52:56.628 --> 06:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
issues surrounding emerging Medical
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
Technology as deemed relevant by the
 
06:53:00.890 --> 06:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee and to me it's supremely
 
06:53:04.190 --> 06:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
relevant but
 
06:53:05.750 --> 06:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that I'll be around for
 
06:53:07.430 --> 06:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
this committee doesn't mean that I'd be
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
chosen for this committee but that would
 
06:53:11.270 --> 06:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
allow that so um and part of the reason
 
06:53:13.010 --> 06:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
about having biomarkers specifically
 
06:53:16.030 --> 06:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
called out is that Katherine Rogers
 
06:53:18.530 --> 06:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
biomarkers were very critical in the
 
06:53:21.708 --> 06:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and treatment with her cancer
 
06:53:24.410 --> 06:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Canon
 
06:53:26.628 --> 06:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
I was on this special subcommittee that
 
06:53:30.890 --> 06:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed this whole effort and the thing
 
06:53:33.590 --> 06:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we did flag was that there's a lot
 
06:53:35.510 --> 06:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
of great Technologies but some of it's
 
06:53:38.708 --> 06:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
moving as slow as some glaciers
 
06:53:42.610 --> 06:53:42.620 align:start position:0%
and that we needed to monitor it
 
06:53:45.410 --> 06:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
part of it was that the technology and
 
06:53:48.288 --> 06:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
what it does but it's also the impact on
 
06:53:50.690 --> 06:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
the state as far as who's going to pay
 
06:53:53.270 --> 06:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is what we're discussing here as
 
06:53:56.330 --> 06:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
we as those products are brought to
 
06:53:59.390 --> 06:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
Market and are we going to have to worry
 
06:54:01.548 --> 06:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid are we going to have to
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
worry about oh which insurance company
 
06:54:05.750 --> 06:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
all right so part of part of this has to
 
06:54:08.570 --> 06:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
be the awareness of the committee and
 
06:54:08.580 --> 06:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
be the awareness of the committee and
and

06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:12.530 --> 06:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
my guess is one time a year is not
 
06:54:12.540 --> 06:54:14.468 align:start position:0%
my guess is one time a year is not
enough

06:54:14.468 --> 06:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
enough
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
and but it is going to have to keep
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
track of a number of Technologies and
 
06:54:21.708 --> 06:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
conferences and a number of other areas
 
06:54:24.830 --> 06:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
to contribute yeah no thank you and that
 
06:54:26.628 --> 06:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
actually was one of the areas that I had
 
06:54:28.010 --> 06:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
been concerned with with the original
 
06:54:30.530 --> 06:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
scope because if you were to follow all
 
06:54:32.030 --> 06:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
the conferences and all the Publications
 
06:54:34.310 --> 06:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
relevant to the area
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
um we'd probably need the entire
 
06:54:37.490 --> 06:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislative body just drained up and
 
06:54:40.250 --> 06:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
competent on that I covered a very very
 
06:54:41.810 --> 06:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
narrow subset of implantable medical
 
06:54:43.968 --> 06:54:43.978 align:start position:0%
devices and even with that I had to
 
06:54:46.010 --> 06:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
narrow it further
 
06:54:48.110 --> 06:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I I was attending a dozen medical
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
conferences and they never overlapped
 
06:54:52.250 --> 06:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
with a lot of other analysts so it's
 
06:54:55.310 --> 06:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's such a complex area that
 
06:54:58.010 --> 06:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
it was right for Burnout from trying to
 
06:54:59.930 --> 06:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
cover all of that data because as it is
 
06:55:02.090 --> 06:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
I get mid page today but I can read that
 
06:55:04.190 --> 06:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
maybe once a month when that email comes
 
06:55:04.200 --> 06:55:05.350 align:start position:0%
maybe once a month when that email comes
through

06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:55:08.090 --> 06:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
if I believe that the original Bill said
 
06:55:10.128 --> 06:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
at least annually
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and it's it was the same language in
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill so I I didn't want that we
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
might want to change it to maybe
 
06:55:19.310 --> 06:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
quarterly at least quarterly I think
 
06:55:21.288 --> 06:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
quarterly would be good just for our own
 
06:55:26.208 --> 06:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Nagel
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
you have a few refers oh sorry who did I
 
06:55:33.590 --> 06:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
miss well representative Murphy put his
 
06:55:34.788 --> 06:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
hand up first
 
06:55:37.670 --> 06:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
oh you recognize me though yes all right
 
06:55:37.680 --> 06:55:38.708 align:start position:0%
oh you recognize me though yes all right
fine

06:55:38.708 --> 06:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:55:40.670 --> 06:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
I mean one of the interesting
 
06:55:42.468 --> 06:55:42.478 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we had heard that
 
06:55:45.170 --> 06:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
prompted a re something for me was this
 
06:55:48.650 --> 06:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
is almost an impossible charge yeah and
 
06:55:50.448 --> 06:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
um was that what you were gonna say oh
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
darn sorry
 
06:55:54.770 --> 06:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's lent I shouldn't have done that but
 
06:55:54.780 --> 06:55:54.830 align:start position:0%
it's lent I shouldn't have done that but
um

06:55:54.830 --> 06:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:54.840 --> 06:55:56.868 align:start position:0%
um
[Laughter]

06:55:56.868 --> 06:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:56:00.170 --> 06:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
I I just I have a couple questions that
 
06:56:01.788 --> 06:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
that are you know that we're almost like
 
06:56:04.750 --> 06:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
not in an executive session here I
 
06:56:07.670 --> 06:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
is this already being done this state in
 
06:56:09.830 --> 06:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
some way how do other states handle this
 
06:56:09.840 --> 06:56:10.788 align:start position:0%
some way how do other states handle this
issue

06:56:10.788 --> 06:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:56:12.948 --> 06:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
um are we is this a first in the nation
 
06:56:15.708 --> 06:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
type effort um how do other people do it
 
06:56:17.570 --> 06:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
I mean those are all my questions
 
06:56:20.330 --> 06:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
regarding this because this my thinking
 
06:56:22.730 --> 06:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
about this was you know a technology
 
06:56:25.548 --> 06:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
comes in bad things happen which is you
 
06:56:27.110 --> 06:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
kind of already raise and that may be
 
06:56:28.850 --> 06:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
the focus of something like that it just
 
06:56:31.430 --> 06:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
seems the focus is too broad
 
06:56:32.990 --> 06:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you I think I think that it is
 
06:56:34.670 --> 06:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
a broad Focus but
 
06:56:36.590 --> 06:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
um it's a matter of it being allowed to
 
06:56:38.990 --> 06:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
focus on representative marketing no I
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
was gonna Echo what uh representative
 
06:56:43.190 --> 06:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
Eagle said but I I regardless of
 
06:56:45.230 --> 06:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
changing Xiao to May it is seems like a
 
06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
monumentous task to do
 
06:56:49.730 --> 06:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and I wonder if it should go to not
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
only quarterly but maybe doubling up on
 
06:56:54.230 --> 06:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
the number of uh Representatives that
 
06:56:56.510 --> 06:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
are on the committee I mean this is It's
 
06:56:58.190 --> 06:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
a sizable task and I'm just thinking
 
06:57:00.468 --> 06:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
that wow you know even if we change it
 
06:57:02.990 --> 06:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
to may you know it's still there's a
 
06:57:05.030 --> 06:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of data that we have to
 
06:57:07.070 --> 06:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
take a look at that's all
 
06:57:08.770 --> 06:57:08.780 align:start position:0%
willing to go to four and two
 
06:57:10.490 --> 06:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you had
 
06:57:12.530 --> 06:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
something or no
 
06:57:14.868 --> 06:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
no I think I think it's
 
06:57:16.910 --> 06:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think it was sort of subsumed in some
 
06:57:19.730 --> 06:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
of those comments so okay
 
06:57:21.468 --> 06:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
yeah is that Representative Bob kofot
 
06:57:24.128 --> 06:57:24.138 align:start position:0%
hasn't spoken on it yet
 
06:57:27.650 --> 06:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
so I guess so I was very interested in
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the mention of regenerative regenerative
 
06:57:32.628 --> 06:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
medicine because I think that's one of
 
06:57:34.910 --> 06:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
those areas that uh
 
06:57:34.920 --> 06:57:36.230 align:start position:0%
those areas that uh
is

06:57:36.230 --> 06:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:57:38.810 --> 06:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
going to be growing rapidly in the in
 
06:57:41.690 --> 06:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
the near future and has a lot of promise
 
06:57:44.930 --> 06:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
but I guess for me the the line the line
 
06:57:48.530 --> 06:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
that stands out here is line 29 on the
 
06:57:50.750 --> 06:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
on the amendment removing barriers to
 
06:57:53.810 --> 06:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
access for emerging medical Technologies
 
06:57:53.820 --> 06:57:54.708 align:start position:0%
access for emerging medical Technologies
um

06:57:54.708 --> 06:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:56.990 --> 06:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
I mean practically speaking you know
 
06:57:59.150 --> 06:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
this this committee is going to be
 
06:58:01.730 --> 06:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
composed of people who are
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
um who may or may not have
 
06:58:06.770 --> 06:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
medical expertise per se but as
 
06:58:09.128 --> 06:58:09.138 align:start position:0%
legislators we can propose legislation
 
06:58:13.010 --> 06:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
that removes barriers and gets
 
06:58:15.410 --> 06:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
government out of the way or or in
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
essence you know paves the the way for
 
06:58:22.190 --> 06:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh for Innovation to happen here in the
 
06:58:24.590 --> 06:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
state I am
 
06:58:26.270 --> 06:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
06:58:29.270 --> 06:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
concerned that you know we do have a
 
06:58:30.650 --> 06:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
proliferation of committees and
 
06:58:33.170 --> 06:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
commissions and uh
 
06:58:35.570 --> 06:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
although we have not yet met we have a
 
06:58:38.448 --> 06:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions uh that is
 
06:58:41.390 --> 06:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
going to be uh meeting in in April to
 
06:58:44.448 --> 06:58:44.458 align:start position:0%
get rid of some of the excess committees
 
06:58:46.128 --> 06:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
and commissions that have not met in
 
06:58:49.430 --> 06:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
quite a long time having said that I I
 
06:58:52.010 --> 06:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
do believe that this is is worth moving
 
06:58:53.448 --> 06:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
06:58:56.530 --> 06:58:56.540 align:start position:0%
um I think it's an opportunity for us to
 
06:58:59.690 --> 06:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
solicit input from medical professionals
 
06:59:01.910 --> 06:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
to understand what are the barriers how
 
06:59:03.770 --> 06:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
do we get out of the way how do we pave
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
the way for Innovation and
 
06:59:08.090 --> 06:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
um you know and and move forward with
 
06:59:09.590 --> 06:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
some of these life-saving technologies
 
06:59:10.968 --> 06:59:10.978 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:59:13.250 --> 06:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know that are are coming at us
 
06:59:15.410 --> 06:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
rapidly and you know we just need to
 
06:59:18.770 --> 06:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
make it possible to innovate
 
06:59:21.170 --> 06:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
06:59:23.330 --> 06:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh Madam cheers I'm just
 
06:59:25.128 --> 06:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
wondering about the mechanics of how
 
06:59:27.048 --> 06:59:27.058 align:start position:0%
this would work the three people who are
 
06:59:28.968 --> 06:59:28.978 align:start position:0%
chosen even if it goes to six people
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they're medical maybe they're not
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
MediCal so how do they identify what to
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
attack who just to solicit
 
06:59:41.030 --> 06:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason that this is a
 
06:59:43.968 --> 06:59:43.978 align:start position:0%
committee and not a commission where you
 
06:59:46.850 --> 06:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
might be able to bring some people in
 
06:59:50.390 --> 06:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
that might kind of guide the direction
 
06:59:52.850 --> 06:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
um and that's my only thought
 
06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you actually if I can speak to
 
06:59:56.570 --> 06:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
that and to the other one
 
06:59:58.128 --> 06:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
um part of it is this they would still
 
06:59:59.448 --> 06:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
be able to bring people in for those
 
06:59:59.458 --> 07:00:01.010 align:start position:0%
be able to bring people in for those
discussions

07:00:01.010 --> 07:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
07:00:03.288 --> 07:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
um and that that flaw around the people
 
07:00:04.368 --> 07:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
who are on there and what their
 
07:00:05.628 --> 07:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
backgrounds are is also one that's
 
07:00:07.788 --> 07:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
common to the underlying bill
 
07:00:09.410 --> 07:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
um this was to try and craft it into
 
07:00:11.510 --> 07:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
something that
 
07:00:14.448 --> 07:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be so deeply focused on the
 
07:00:16.850 --> 07:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
day-to-day publication minutia
 
07:00:18.590 --> 07:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
um but could zoom out a little bit so
 
07:00:20.208 --> 07:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
that it could then choose selectively
 
07:00:22.310 --> 07:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then dive down from the 50 000 feet
 
07:00:23.868 --> 07:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
to whatever level of inquiry
 
07:00:26.270 --> 07:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I would just
 
07:00:28.368 --> 07:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
say that my experience of committees and
 
07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
commissions is if you get a commission
 
07:00:33.110 --> 07:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
with 26 people on it then the 27th 28th
 
07:00:34.730 --> 07:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
and 29th are going to come here and say
 
07:00:36.910 --> 07:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
why weren't we on the commission
 
07:00:40.788 --> 07:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
so it was framed in the first place as
 
07:00:43.190 --> 07:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
these people shall be invited but it
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be limited to if you actually
 
07:00:47.868 --> 07:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
put them on as voting members you will
 
07:00:50.810 --> 07:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
never get a quorum and getting them
 
07:00:55.250 --> 07:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
appointed is a Herculean task
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I have seen the seminal one was and I
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
can't remember her name but a wonderful
 
07:01:07.990 --> 07:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh very effective representative
 
07:01:10.368 --> 07:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
Republican who started in the house and
 
07:01:13.850 --> 07:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
then went to the Senate but she did a
 
07:01:19.570 --> 07:01:19.580 align:start position:0%
committee and there were five members on
 
07:01:23.110 --> 07:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
truancy and she managed to bring in
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
every single population who might be
 
07:01:32.468 --> 07:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
affected in any way from school through
 
07:01:35.270 --> 07:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
truancy officers to all of the home
 
07:01:38.150 --> 07:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
school people came every single time and
 
07:01:40.788 --> 07:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
put in their input and how are we going
 
07:01:43.788 --> 07:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
to track all of this and she had she
 
07:01:46.330 --> 07:01:46.340 align:start position:0%
must have had 40 or 50 different people
 
07:01:49.730 --> 07:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
Plus at least 20 constituencies who were
 
07:01:51.170 --> 07:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
there for every single meeting because
 
07:01:53.390 --> 07:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
it impacted them they knew it would
 
07:01:56.510 --> 07:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
impact them and you know one of the
 
07:01:59.690 --> 07:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
things that we have seen with some
 
07:02:02.030 --> 07:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
committees is
 
07:02:02.040 --> 07:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
committees is
um

07:02:02.990 --> 07:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:05.750 --> 07:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally they're set up to favor one
 
07:02:08.990 --> 07:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
particular goal and this one is Broad
 
07:02:11.270 --> 07:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
enough that I think
 
07:02:15.128 --> 07:02:15.138 align:start position:0%
uh that that wouldn't happen but
 
07:02:17.208 --> 07:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
sometimes there have been committees
 
07:02:19.968 --> 07:02:19.978 align:start position:0%
that have been uh captured by their
 
07:02:22.968 --> 07:02:22.978 align:start position:0%
appointed non-legislative members to
 
07:02:26.390 --> 07:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
further an agenda to make it easier to
 
07:02:29.930 --> 07:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
further legislatively their agenda and
 
07:02:32.650 --> 07:02:32.660 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily a bad thing
 
07:02:35.990 --> 07:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
but it's something I would look at a
 
07:02:41.090 --> 07:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:41.100 --> 07:02:44.530 align:start position:0%
 
otherwise

07:02:44.530 --> 07:02:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:47.570 --> 07:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the speed of
 
07:02:49.430 --> 07:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
regenerative medicine coming to us in
 
07:02:51.650 --> 07:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire back when I was on Wall
 
07:02:53.810 --> 07:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
Street I wanted to be the best person on
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
stem cells so back in 2008 I went to
 
07:02:59.270 --> 07:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
Case Western Reserve University some
 
07:02:59.280 --> 07:03:00.788 align:start position:0%
Case Western Reserve University some
some

07:03:00.788 --> 07:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
some
 
07:03:04.368 --> 07:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
tissue engineering course for two weeks
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
because I thought those were around the
 
07:03:07.788 --> 07:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
corner those are the products that
 
07:03:10.430 --> 07:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're working to bring to a platform
 
07:03:12.590 --> 07:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
that could potentially move towards the
 
07:03:16.490 --> 07:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
market in Manchester in The Mill Yard so
 
07:03:18.650 --> 07:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
you don't know which barriers there are
 
07:03:21.830 --> 07:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a challenge so I'm hopeful that
 
07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that if we amend it to
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
include the reference to return the
 
07:03:26.990 --> 07:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
reference to representative Rogers
 
07:03:28.670 --> 07:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
change it to two members of the Senate
 
07:03:30.110 --> 07:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
four of the House of Representatives
 
07:03:34.128 --> 07:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
move it to a may add biomarkers and make
 
07:03:37.430 --> 07:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
it quarterly that that
 
07:03:39.170 --> 07:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
would address the issues that people see
 
07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and if that's the
 
07:03:43.910 --> 07:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
case then I can have that redrafted for
 
07:03:46.548 --> 07:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
us next week and this would deal with
 
07:03:48.288 --> 07:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
some of the issues from the summer
 
07:03:48.298 --> 07:03:49.670 align:start position:0%
some of the issues from the summer
so

07:03:49.670 --> 07:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:03:51.468 --> 07:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything else I needed to
 
07:03:53.448 --> 07:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
add to that representative not not to
 
07:03:56.510 --> 07:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
add but I like the forward thinkingness
 
07:04:00.110 --> 07:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill you know it it's not
 
07:04:01.788 --> 07:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
um so many of our bills were solving
 
07:04:03.650 --> 07:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
problems but here we're looking for
 
07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
Solutions or I think it's a great idea
 
07:04:08.628 --> 07:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:04:10.968 --> 07:04:10.978 align:start position:0%
uh then if there's no other concerns
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
then um we will recess the executive
 
07:04:18.530 --> 07:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 323
 
07:04:20.570 --> 07:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
um until next week um we'll be noticing
 
07:04:22.368 --> 07:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
in the calendar specifically what which
 
07:04:24.110 --> 07:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
days I'm hopeful we can get through
 
07:04:26.448 --> 07:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
enough bills so that we only have one
 
07:04:28.670 --> 07:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
day next week and with that I will open
 
07:04:32.468 --> 07:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 454
 
07:04:35.270 --> 07:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the membership and Reporting
 
07:04:37.250 --> 07:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the Examining Board
 
07:04:38.930 --> 07:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
07:04:40.610 --> 07:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and I represent recognize
 
07:04:43.010 --> 07:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman for a motion
 
07:04:45.590 --> 07:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I moved that
 
07:04:48.110 --> 07:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
07:04:50.448 --> 07:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
sorry 454b
 
07:04:52.310 --> 07:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:04:56.208 --> 07:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:01.730 --> 07:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:04.190 --> 07:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
yep thank you would you like to speak to
 
07:05:06.708 --> 07:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
your motion sure
 
07:05:09.110 --> 07:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought to us by
 
07:05:11.570 --> 07:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
um representative Jess Edwards
 
07:05:16.128 --> 07:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:21.048 --> 07:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:23.030 --> 07:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
it adds two
 
07:05:23.040 --> 07:05:24.048 align:start position:0%
it adds two
um

07:05:24.048 --> 07:05:24.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:28.368 --> 07:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
two of the public members to be
 
07:05:28.378 --> 07:05:29.208 align:start position:0%
two of the public members to be
um

07:05:29.208 --> 07:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:32.628 --> 07:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
on sorry any member of the public so
 
07:05:34.368 --> 07:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
it'll add an additional public member to
 
07:05:36.350 --> 07:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
the board and then
 
07:05:38.090 --> 07:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
one of the public members is going to be
 
07:05:39.530 --> 07:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
designated the public transparency
 
07:05:43.368 --> 07:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
Advocate it's to try to bring
 
07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
some openness to process have someone on
 
07:05:49.310 --> 07:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
the board just ensure that the way that
 
07:05:51.410 --> 07:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
things are going is with a mind to
 
07:05:54.350 --> 07:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
transparency I think it's a pretty
 
07:05:57.350 --> 07:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:59.868 --> 07:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
and um
 
07:06:02.208 --> 07:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth bringing to the house
 
07:06:02.218 --> 07:06:03.468 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth bringing to the house
floor

07:06:03.468 --> 07:06:03.478 align:start position:0%
floor
 
07:06:05.628 --> 07:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm representative kofot would
 
07:06:09.670 --> 07:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:13.128 --> 07:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
no I I just I I would Echo the the
 
07:06:14.570 --> 07:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
statements that representative Cushman
 
07:06:17.510 --> 07:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
made it it it it provides greater public
 
07:06:19.788 --> 07:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
participation and transparency so I
 
07:06:22.730 --> 07:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
think it's it's worthy of uh were there
 
07:06:29.570 --> 07:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:30.830 --> 07:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
07:06:33.288 --> 07:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
that's right my only comment is I'm not
 
07:06:36.250 --> 07:06:36.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to this but when um
 
07:06:40.310 --> 07:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson was uh testified
 
07:06:41.868 --> 07:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
um I think he testified on all of these
 
07:06:44.330 --> 07:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
ones about the medical society I mean
 
07:06:46.968 --> 07:06:46.978 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:06:49.250 --> 07:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine thank you
 
07:06:53.090 --> 07:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
um is that the other bill is is uh 322
 
07:06:54.890 --> 07:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
which established the committee to look
 
07:06:57.110 --> 07:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
at all of this and so I'm just wondering
 
07:06:59.208 --> 07:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
whether that's the bill we want to focus
 
07:07:01.190 --> 07:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
on and then bring it back rather than
 
07:07:02.570 --> 07:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
making a change and then having this
 
07:07:04.250 --> 07:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
committee come up with other ideas for
 
07:07:05.690 --> 07:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
it for changes
 
07:07:08.890 --> 07:07:08.900 align:start position:0%
that's my comment thank you
 
07:07:12.288 --> 07:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
and I will make my comment on this one
 
07:07:13.910 --> 07:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the issues with the news this summer
 
07:07:15.410 --> 07:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
was that there didn't seem to be
 
07:07:17.330 --> 07:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
transparency and people didn't know how
 
07:07:20.030 --> 07:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
to be communicated with around those
 
07:07:21.890 --> 07:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
emerging risks we need to make sure that
 
07:07:25.010 --> 07:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
this is done in a way where it doesn't
 
07:07:26.510 --> 07:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
harm our doctors it doesn't harm our
 
07:07:28.010 --> 07:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals and especially doesn't harm
 
07:07:31.730 --> 07:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
our patients and having a public public
 
07:07:34.390 --> 07:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
transparency expert seems to be a
 
07:07:36.948 --> 07:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
minimal intervention in order to let
 
07:07:38.330 --> 07:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
them see if there's something that they
 
07:07:40.190 --> 07:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
can find as opposed to looking from the
 
07:07:42.770 --> 07:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
outside and so personally
 
07:07:46.010 --> 07:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
um with a combination of
 
07:07:49.070 --> 07:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that new Innovative devices
 
07:07:51.170 --> 07:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
that there's a way to check up on that
 
07:07:52.850 --> 07:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Medicine if there are
 
07:07:55.250 --> 07:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
problems and combined with having a
 
07:07:56.868 --> 07:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
public transparency I think that that
 
07:08:00.468 --> 07:08:00.478 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues that um brought our
 
07:08:03.468 --> 07:08:03.478 align:start position:0%
state to the headlines last summer
 
07:08:05.208 --> 07:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
um and would be able to do that without
 
07:08:07.730 --> 07:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
creating that Commission on the other
 
07:08:09.948 --> 07:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
rules representative Pearson is a
 
07:08:12.650 --> 07:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill as am I with
 
07:08:15.350 --> 07:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards on this so it was
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
was one approach to do that on a light
 
07:08:17.760 --> 07:08:19.968 align:start position:0%
was one approach to do that on a light
touch

07:08:19.968 --> 07:08:19.978 align:start position:0%
touch
 
07:08:22.910 --> 07:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro it seems to me
 
07:08:24.708 --> 07:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
that one of the things this bill does is
 
07:08:26.750 --> 07:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
it it says at least two of the public
 
07:08:26.760 --> 07:08:28.670 align:start position:0%
it it says at least two of the public
members

07:08:28.670 --> 07:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
07:08:28.680 --> 07:08:29.628 align:start position:0%
members
um

07:08:29.628 --> 07:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:32.510 --> 07:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
shall be a person who is not or never
 
07:08:34.730 --> 07:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
was part of the medical profession and
 
07:08:37.010 --> 07:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
that seems like a reasonable idea to me
 
07:08:38.930 --> 07:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
to not make it a
 
07:08:42.590 --> 07:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Club of just medical professionals who
 
07:08:45.468 --> 07:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
might be self-protective so that seems
 
07:08:47.208 --> 07:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
like a good idea to me it seems like
 
07:08:48.890 --> 07:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this bill at
 
07:08:50.150 --> 07:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
07:08:52.968 --> 07:08:52.978 align:start position:0%
nobody could really figure out how this
 
07:08:55.968 --> 07:08:55.978 align:start position:0%
quotes transparency Advocate would
 
07:08:59.510 --> 07:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually get information from you know
 
07:09:01.548 --> 07:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
how information would come to that
 
07:09:04.490 --> 07:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
person of the kind that we weren't
 
07:09:06.548 --> 07:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
getting about this doctor in Manchester
 
07:09:09.410 --> 07:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really sure how that works
 
07:09:11.690 --> 07:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
but doesn't really matter to me that
 
07:09:14.750 --> 07:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
much it's just you know I would be in
 
07:09:16.910 --> 07:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill because the spirit of
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
it is to try to open things up and make
 
07:09:22.250 --> 07:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
it more transparent and
 
07:09:24.230 --> 07:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how effective that position
 
07:09:26.390 --> 07:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
will be but I I think I would support
 
07:09:28.010 --> 07:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
this bill anyway thank you
 
07:09:30.410 --> 07:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I I think to answer
 
07:09:32.208 --> 07:09:32.218 align:start position:0%
that question that's where the other
 
07:09:35.208 --> 07:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
Bill comes in is to figure out how
 
07:09:37.610 --> 07:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
such and such a hospital will deal with
 
07:09:39.110 --> 07:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine For example there
 
07:09:40.730 --> 07:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
was no requirement that that hospital
 
07:09:42.410 --> 07:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
shared that information with the
 
07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
hospital but once that information is
 
07:09:45.590 --> 07:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
solved hopefully with the other bill
 
07:09:48.048 --> 07:09:48.058 align:start position:0%
then this person's job becomes more
 
07:09:48.058 --> 07:09:51.170 align:start position:0%
then this person's job becomes more
effective

07:09:51.170 --> 07:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:53.690 --> 07:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
07:09:57.830 --> 07:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I am remembering that Mrs Casey my
 
07:09:59.510 --> 07:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
sixth grade teacher would have told me
 
07:10:02.150 --> 07:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we talked about it last time that we
 
07:10:05.270 --> 07:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
should have made it shall be persons who
 
07:10:08.390 --> 07:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
are not because it's at least two of the
 
07:10:11.150 --> 07:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
members shall be a person doesn't work
 
07:10:14.090 --> 07:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
but that is the kind of thing that can
 
07:10:16.010 --> 07:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
either be fixed in the senate or by
 
07:10:17.628 --> 07:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled Bill Amendment because it is
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
merely grammatical in nature so I don't
 
07:10:23.810 --> 07:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
think we need to hold up for uh
 
07:10:25.968 --> 07:10:25.978 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need to hold up for
 
07:10:29.390 --> 07:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment and if we are expecting to
 
07:10:31.490 --> 07:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
get as far as I think we were hoping to
 
07:10:31.500 --> 07:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
get as far as I think we were hoping to
get

07:10:32.810 --> 07:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
get
 
07:10:38.270 --> 07:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:40.070 --> 07:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
would you like representative
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so just in response to
 
07:10:45.770 --> 07:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question about
 
07:10:47.868 --> 07:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
how how would that public
 
07:10:50.590 --> 07:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
transparency Advocate there is a line
 
07:10:54.110 --> 07:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
added to Statute in towards the end of
 
07:10:55.368 --> 07:10:55.378 align:start position:0%
the bill and I don't have line numbers
 
07:10:57.468 --> 07:10:57.478 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now but
 
07:10:59.690 --> 07:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
um that essentially says the the reports
 
07:11:02.090 --> 07:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
of that public transparency Advocate
 
07:11:03.890 --> 07:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
will be made part of the public record
 
07:11:06.650 --> 07:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I think that there is a mechanism in
 
07:11:09.410 --> 07:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
place that that helps to at least
 
07:11:15.468 --> 07:11:15.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:18.350 --> 07:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
that are we ready to call the roll
 
07:11:20.750 --> 07:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh then I would ask the clerk to call
 
07:11:25.128 --> 07:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:28.490 --> 07:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill 454.

representative Cannon yes
 
07:12:09.590 --> 07:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think I heard yes right okay thank you
 
07:12:13.010 --> 07:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham yes
 
07:12:16.010 --> 07:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes
 
07:12:18.230 --> 07:12:18.240 align:start position:0%

representative select yes

and representative lamb yes
 
07:12:33.948 --> 07:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
we'll need a zero um it passes 20 to
 
07:12:35.570 --> 07:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
zero any objections to the consent
 
07:12:35.580 --> 07:12:36.650 align:start position:0%
zero any objections to the consent
calendar

07:12:36.650 --> 07:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
07:12:39.948 --> 07:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
and I see representative Cushman would
 
07:12:41.448 --> 07:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
be doing a lot of writing I'll write the
 
07:12:45.708 --> 07:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:47.930 --> 07:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
with that I opened the executive session
 
07:12:52.250 --> 07:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 322 relative to
 
07:12:53.930 --> 07:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine and I
 
07:12:57.708 --> 07:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Bill king for a
 
07:12:57.718 --> 07:13:00.650 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Bill king for a
motion

07:13:00.650 --> 07:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:05.270 --> 07:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes House Bill 322 is a bill that
 
07:13:07.250 --> 07:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study the New
 
07:13:09.048 --> 07:13:09.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine
 
07:13:11.628 --> 07:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
and I would like to make a motion that
 
07:13:13.910 --> 07:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
we make this one in expedient to
 
07:13:17.090 --> 07:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
legislate even though my great friend
 
07:13:19.190 --> 07:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson is the one
 
07:13:22.128 --> 07:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
pushing this one through I did have some
 
07:13:24.288 --> 07:13:24.298 align:start position:0%
discussion with him and we just needed a
 
07:13:25.670 --> 07:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
second and then you can speak to emotion
 
07:13:31.910 --> 07:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:33.890 --> 07:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you and now you can you can speak
 
07:13:35.750 --> 07:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the motion representative King all
 
07:13:35.760 --> 07:13:36.650 align:start position:0%
to the motion representative King all
right

07:13:36.650 --> 07:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:13:39.170 --> 07:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
sorry about my eagerness
 
07:13:39.180 --> 07:13:39.890 align:start position:0%
sorry about my eagerness
um

07:13:39.890 --> 07:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:39.900 --> 07:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:13:41.030 --> 07:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:13:41.040 --> 07:13:41.930 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:13:41.930 --> 07:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:44.048 --> 07:13:44.058 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned
 
07:13:47.150 --> 07:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
my good friend representative Pearson
 
07:13:48.548 --> 07:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
Mark Pearson
 
07:13:52.010 --> 07:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
put this bill forward and
 
07:13:53.390 --> 07:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
07:13:55.850 --> 07:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
he has kind of admitted that there's
 
07:13:58.430 --> 07:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
duplicate bills that are doing similar
 
07:14:00.948 --> 07:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
things and we just talked about one as a
 
07:14:03.650 --> 07:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
matter of fact maybe two
 
07:14:07.610 --> 07:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
So based on redundancy I would I would
 
07:14:10.070 --> 07:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
like to find this one in expedient to
 
07:14:10.080 --> 07:14:12.048 align:start position:0%
like to find this one in expedient to
legislate

07:14:12.048 --> 07:14:12.058 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
07:14:13.910 --> 07:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to the
 
07:14:16.968 --> 07:14:16.978 align:start position:0%
second or is that included in there
 
07:14:19.868 --> 07:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
it's further discussion
 
07:14:22.548 --> 07:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just going to
 
07:14:24.350 --> 07:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
ask a question which is
 
07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
um if there is another one other than
 
07:14:28.610 --> 07:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
these two what's the third one
 
07:14:30.770 --> 07:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's in another committee and yeah oh
 
07:14:34.868 --> 07:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:37.190 --> 07:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
07:14:39.230 --> 07:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
so this isn't so much
 
07:14:39.240 --> 07:14:40.670 align:start position:0%
so this isn't so much
I

07:14:40.670 --> 07:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:14:43.730 --> 07:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think that the state of Vermont just
 
07:14:44.750 --> 07:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
went through a whole sort of
 
07:14:49.690 --> 07:14:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:49.700 --> 07:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:14:51.590 --> 07:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:54.468 --> 07:14:54.478 align:start position:0%
I guess my the reason I'd be in favor of
 
07:14:56.990 --> 07:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
starting this so I'm not I'm not gonna
 
07:15:00.350 --> 07:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
go nuts about it is just that there was
 
07:15:02.990 --> 07:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of tricky issues about how to
 
07:15:07.190 --> 07:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
balance getting better transparency with
 
07:15:09.468 --> 07:15:09.478 align:start position:0%
maintaining peer review
 
07:15:12.048 --> 07:15:12.058 align:start position:0%
and it may be that we sort of wait and
 
07:15:13.548 --> 07:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
see what happens and come up with
 
07:15:16.128 --> 07:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
another bill next year but it's it's an
 
07:15:20.030 --> 07:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
issue that um I mean there's a very the
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
fine line is
 
07:15:21.600 --> 07:15:22.128 align:start position:0%
fine line is
um

07:15:22.128 --> 07:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:25.968 --> 07:15:25.978 align:start position:0%
transparency versus making it possible
 
07:15:27.650 --> 07:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
for things to be reported in a hospital
 
07:15:31.128 --> 07:15:31.138 align:start position:0%
so we can we can correct problems before
 
07:15:34.070 --> 07:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
they become bigger problems or um and
 
07:15:35.750 --> 07:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that we
 
07:15:38.510 --> 07:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't lose that but again maybe it's see
 
07:15:40.010 --> 07:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
what this does to the Board of Medicine
 
07:15:41.868 --> 07:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
see what happens over the next year and
 
07:15:43.610 --> 07:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
then come back with something to look
 
07:15:45.948 --> 07:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
more closely at that
 
07:15:48.288 --> 07:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
07:15:50.690 --> 07:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
and following on in that vein I just
 
07:15:52.490 --> 07:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
want to put forward
 
07:15:52.500 --> 07:15:53.890 align:start position:0%
want to put forward
without

07:15:53.890 --> 07:15:53.900 align:start position:0%
without
 
07:15:56.510 --> 07:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
really taking a position one way or
 
07:15:59.030 --> 07:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
another would that mean that it might be
 
07:15:59.040 --> 07:16:00.170 align:start position:0%
another would that mean that it might be
more

07:16:00.170 --> 07:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:16:00.180 --> 07:16:00.770 align:start position:0%
more
um

07:16:00.770 --> 07:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:03.890 --> 07:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
sensible of us to retain this bill in
 
07:16:06.590 --> 07:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
case we need it in the fall or whether
 
07:16:09.948 --> 07:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
we sh rather than a straight itl which
 
07:16:11.448 --> 07:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
then means you have to bring back
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
something substantially different next
 
07:16:13.680 --> 07:16:16.670 align:start position:0%
something substantially different next
year

07:16:16.670 --> 07:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:16.680 --> 07:16:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:16:17.810 --> 07:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:20.690 --> 07:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
I think I think that that
 
07:16:22.850 --> 07:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
I think that that may be reasonable um
 
07:16:22.860 --> 07:16:23.750 align:start position:0%
I think that that may be reasonable um
but

07:16:23.750 --> 07:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:16:25.670 --> 07:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
if that was something the committee
 
07:16:28.730 --> 07:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to do we could do that with uh
 
07:16:31.070 --> 07:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
the person moving and seconding
 
07:16:33.288 --> 07:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
withdrawing their motion but I I don't
 
07:16:35.208 --> 07:16:35.218 align:start position:0%
want to force that on anybody one way or
 
07:16:36.650 --> 07:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
the other I'm I'm comfortable with
 
07:16:36.660 --> 07:16:38.750 align:start position:0%
the other I'm I'm comfortable with
either

07:16:38.750 --> 07:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:16:38.760 --> 07:16:40.010 align:start position:0%
either
um

07:16:40.010 --> 07:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:41.448 --> 07:16:41.458 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's if that's something
 
07:16:45.190 --> 07:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:47.930 --> 07:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to withdraw my motion
 
07:16:50.990 --> 07:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
to uh in expedient to legislate and make
 
07:16:53.330 --> 07:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
it retain all right thank you and this
 
07:16:55.490 --> 07:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
and our second was uh representative
 
07:16:57.230 --> 07:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
Resort do you agree with that as well
 
07:17:01.128 --> 07:17:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:03.288 --> 07:17:03.298 align:start position:0%
I think that that was a excellent point
 
07:17:05.690 --> 07:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
if we want to vote on the retained
 
07:17:07.128 --> 07:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
motion I think we're ready to call the
 
07:17:08.990 --> 07:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
roll there
 
07:17:10.510 --> 07:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:17:12.530 --> 07:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're tasked with everything on this
 
07:17:14.690 --> 07:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
bill okay so did you make a motion to
 
07:17:19.250 --> 07:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:22.730 --> 07:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
one fell suit good job
 
07:17:25.430 --> 07:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're amazing
 
07:17:29.690 --> 07:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Cushman yes
 
07:17:31.448 --> 07:17:31.458 align:start position:0%
representative Bill King yes
 
07:17:34.730 --> 07:17:34.740 align:start position:0%

committee
 
07:18:40.080 --> 07:18:40.910 align:start position:0%

representative kofot do you have your
 
07:18:47.468 --> 07:18:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:50.570 --> 07:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
I I do not have that I thought we were
 
07:18:52.610 --> 07:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
going to defer that to another day
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I wasn't sure so I wanted to
 
07:18:56.030 --> 07:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
check to check with you
 
07:18:58.070 --> 07:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so and we do have the amendment ready
 
07:19:00.708 --> 07:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
for house bill 342.
 
07:19:02.510 --> 07:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'll open the exactly what's
 
07:19:04.850 --> 07:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
happening to 557. oh sorry um and let's
 
07:19:11.930 --> 07:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:13.670 --> 07:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
and if you I'll open the executive
 
07:19:16.430 --> 07:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 342 FN relative to
 
07:19:18.590 --> 07:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
lead testing in children and uh
 
07:19:22.250 --> 07:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:25.190 --> 07:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
that'll be distributed now
 
07:19:27.110 --> 07:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
for those keeping track at home this was
 
07:19:29.510 --> 07:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
our 11th bill that we're moving forward
 
07:19:32.990 --> 07:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
on we started relatively late and I'm
 
07:19:35.750 --> 07:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
not sure the feeling in the room if this
 
07:19:37.490 --> 07:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
would leave sick if we ended it after
 
07:19:39.890 --> 07:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
this one this would leave us 16 bills on
 
07:19:41.750 --> 07:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I'm hopeful we could get to
 
07:19:43.788 --> 07:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
another one but remember we did spend
 
07:19:46.250 --> 07:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
two and a half
 
07:19:48.530 --> 07:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
two and a half hours this morning in the
 
07:19:51.590 --> 07:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
work session so I think that it would
 
07:19:53.930 --> 07:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
would require work on our part we could
 
07:19:56.090 --> 07:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
still be feasible for one day next week
 
07:19:58.548 --> 07:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any disagreement
 
07:20:00.770 --> 07:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
about whether that might be feasible I
 
07:20:01.910 --> 07:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
think we should try and get through as
 
07:20:03.948 --> 07:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
many as we can today too to make next
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
week better
 
07:20:07.788 --> 07:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to say I mean
 
07:20:09.590 --> 07:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
pushing through till five I mean we did
 
07:20:11.208 --> 07:20:11.218 align:start position:0%
we did talk about five o'clock yes
 
07:20:15.530 --> 07:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:17.628 --> 07:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
so um if you'd like to tell us a little
 
07:20:18.770 --> 07:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
bit about what this amendment does
 
07:20:20.570 --> 07:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro sure should I
 
07:20:22.010 --> 07:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
make a motion first you can make a
 
07:20:23.750 --> 07:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
motion I will
 
07:20:28.250 --> 07:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
make a motion to adopt Amendment zero
 
07:20:31.968 --> 07:20:31.978 align:start position:0%
eight four two to House Bill 342. and is
 
07:20:33.708 --> 07:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
07:20:37.788 --> 07:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:39.230 --> 07:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
so if you'd like to speak to your mom
 
07:20:43.548 --> 07:20:43.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so what this bill does is um
 
07:20:46.968 --> 07:20:46.978 align:start position:0%
it takes a requirement that um
 
07:20:50.390 --> 07:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:52.310 --> 07:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers test young
 
07:21:00.230 --> 07:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:03.350 --> 07:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
it makes it requires
 
07:21:05.510 --> 07:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
um day cares
 
07:21:05.520 --> 07:21:06.170 align:start position:0%
um day cares
um

07:21:06.170 --> 07:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:08.350 --> 07:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
programs for young children
 
07:21:08.360 --> 07:21:10.330 align:start position:0%
programs for young children
and

07:21:10.330 --> 07:21:10.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:21:15.170 --> 07:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
schools for children up to six to
 
07:21:15.180 --> 07:21:16.788 align:start position:0%
schools for children up to six to
um

07:21:16.788 --> 07:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:23.390 --> 07:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
to document in their physical exams that
 
07:21:30.948 --> 07:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
are um forms that go to the schools and
 
07:21:34.368 --> 07:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
and daycares to document whether the
 
07:21:38.628 --> 07:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
children have actually had a lead
 
07:21:42.110 --> 07:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
blood lead level taken
 
07:21:42.120 --> 07:21:43.070 align:start position:0%
blood lead level taken
um

07:21:43.070 --> 07:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:44.930 --> 07:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
so that's what the original Bill did
 
07:21:48.110 --> 07:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
there was some concern on the parts of
 
07:21:51.650 --> 07:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
daycare providers that if
 
07:21:51.660 --> 07:21:54.350 align:start position:0%
daycare providers that if
um

07:21:54.350 --> 07:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:58.010 --> 07:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
if they were required to document this
 
07:22:01.968 --> 07:22:01.978 align:start position:0%
but the parents didn't get this done
 
07:22:05.150 --> 07:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
that they would in some way be
 
07:22:05.160 --> 07:22:07.610 align:start position:0%
that they would in some way be
um

07:22:07.610 --> 07:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:12.288 --> 07:22:12.298 align:start position:0%
dinged for for this so the the amendment
 
07:22:13.850 --> 07:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
really just
 
07:22:17.390 --> 07:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
says that if for the school district's
 
07:22:19.850 --> 07:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
end for the um
 
07:22:24.048 --> 07:22:24.058 align:start position:0%
daycare providers that if it has not
 
07:22:26.690 --> 07:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
been done and if it is not it's not
 
07:22:29.510 --> 07:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
indicated on the original
 
07:22:33.010 --> 07:22:33.020 align:start position:0%
forms that the
 
07:22:36.110 --> 07:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
providers will be responsible for giving
 
07:22:37.930 --> 07:22:37.940 align:start position:0%
parents information
 
07:22:42.170 --> 07:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:45.110 --> 07:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
that this is supposed to be done and the
 
07:22:47.090 --> 07:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
dangers of lead poisoning and they will
 
07:22:49.490 --> 07:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
document it in their records and they
 
07:22:52.670 --> 07:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
will then have been done their Duty
 
07:22:52.680 --> 07:22:53.390 align:start position:0%
will then have been done their Duty
um

07:22:53.390 --> 07:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:58.250 --> 07:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
so I know that it was Henry vayu who
 
07:23:01.390 --> 07:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
spoke on behalf of the day care centers
 
07:23:04.128 --> 07:23:04.138 align:start position:0%
saying that this could be a problem and
 
07:23:06.590 --> 07:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding from representative
 
07:23:08.750 --> 07:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
Murphy who is no longer here is that
 
07:23:10.628 --> 07:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
she's there oh she is
 
07:23:14.510 --> 07:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
that she talked to him and she was good
 
07:23:16.190 --> 07:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
with this and the Department of Health
 
07:23:17.990 --> 07:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services was good with this as
 
07:23:18.000 --> 07:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
and Human Services was good with this as
well

07:23:20.090 --> 07:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:23:22.250 --> 07:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:23:25.070 --> 07:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
07:23:27.708 --> 07:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
um yes just a moment so we had a lead
 
07:23:30.650 --> 07:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
Bill last year or the year before and I
 
07:23:32.990 --> 07:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
cornered for pediatricians out in the
 
07:23:35.628 --> 07:23:35.638 align:start position:0%
hallway after and I am because they had
 
07:23:39.230 --> 07:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
cited that the testing
 
07:23:41.510 --> 07:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers of testing percentage of
 
07:23:43.670 --> 07:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
people children being tested had dropped
 
07:23:46.368 --> 07:23:46.378 align:start position:0%
and I said so why is that and they said
 
07:23:49.670 --> 07:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
because the they had a little machine
 
07:23:52.070 --> 07:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
that did a finger prick that would test
 
07:23:54.890 --> 07:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the lead levels and they'd all been
 
07:23:57.530 --> 07:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
recalled and so the only way to get a
 
07:24:00.830 --> 07:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
blood draw was a big blood draw and you
 
07:24:02.330 --> 07:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
know I was the mother of the
 
07:24:04.190 --> 07:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
four-year-old that we had to hold down
 
07:24:04.200 --> 07:24:06.170 align:start position:0%
four-year-old that we had to hold down
so

07:24:06.170 --> 07:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:24:08.090 --> 07:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
um hopefully that machine has been
 
07:24:11.990 --> 07:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
reinvented and along with initiatives
 
07:24:14.510 --> 07:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
like this we can get back up to a good
 
07:24:16.850 --> 07:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
level of lead testing
 
07:24:18.650 --> 07:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't just
 
07:24:21.890 --> 07:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
poor parenting or daycares not following
 
07:24:25.310 --> 07:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
through but a mechanical failure of of a
 
07:24:28.788 --> 07:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:30.770 --> 07:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
for further comments
 
07:24:33.288 --> 07:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
on the bill for the amendment I'm sorry
 
07:24:36.170 --> 07:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:37.730 --> 07:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
seeing no further comments on the
 
07:24:39.708 --> 07:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
amendment I will ask the clerk to take
 
07:24:48.530 --> 07:24:48.540 align:start position:0%

otpa on House Bill 342 amended by
 
07:26:05.570 --> 07:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0842h
 
07:26:08.930 --> 07:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
a second by representative thank you
 
07:26:08.940 --> 07:26:10.190 align:start position:0%
a second by representative thank you
fantastic

07:26:10.190 --> 07:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
07:26:12.230 --> 07:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to it or do you
 
07:26:13.368 --> 07:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
feel that it was spoken to with the
 
07:26:16.310 --> 07:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I would just say that um this
 
07:26:18.830 --> 07:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
does not change the requirement for
 
07:26:22.010 --> 07:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
um blood testing which is all
 
07:26:23.690 --> 07:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
um blood level
 
07:26:26.150 --> 07:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
blood lead level testing which is
 
07:26:28.788 --> 07:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
already in statute it really just talks
 
07:26:28.798 --> 07:26:29.930 align:start position:0%
already in statute it really just talks
about

07:26:29.930 --> 07:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:26:33.948 --> 07:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
um recording this when a child goes to
 
07:26:37.190 --> 07:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
school or to daycare and the reason as
 
07:26:39.948 --> 07:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham said is that
 
07:26:39.958 --> 07:26:40.910 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham said is that
um

07:26:40.910 --> 07:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:42.770 --> 07:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
the amount of people actually being
 
07:26:44.330 --> 07:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
tested the amount of children actually
 
07:26:46.968 --> 07:26:46.978 align:start position:0%
being tested had gone down and this is
 
07:26:51.048 --> 07:26:51.058 align:start position:0%
an effort to up those numbers and that
 
07:26:52.968 --> 07:26:52.978 align:start position:0%
there's also an exemption for parents
 
07:26:55.070 --> 07:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
who for some reason did not want their
 
07:27:00.288 --> 07:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:04.610 --> 07:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
I have concerns with this bill and some
 
07:27:07.670 --> 07:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
of it uh you heard when I was
 
07:27:10.968 --> 07:27:10.978 align:start position:0%
questioning during the healing that it
 
07:27:13.968 --> 07:27:13.978 align:start position:0%
feels to me from the graphs that we get
 
07:27:18.530 --> 07:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
that instances of this problem
 
07:27:19.910 --> 07:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
um are not
 
07:27:23.628 --> 07:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
as prevalent as they used to be and this
 
07:27:25.910 --> 07:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
morning I heard about program to get rid
 
07:27:30.350 --> 07:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
of uh lead pipes and definitely we have
 
07:27:34.128 --> 07:27:34.138 align:start position:0%
quite a few programs to get away from
 
07:27:37.448 --> 07:27:37.458 align:start position:0%
lead in painting even in all the housing
 
07:27:42.170 --> 07:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
and also uh knowing that
 
07:27:45.548 --> 07:27:45.558 align:start position:0%
these are already some
 
07:27:50.390 --> 07:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
testing and this bill just plain to
 
07:27:52.490 --> 07:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
force people into testing the totally
 
07:27:56.270 --> 07:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
exist I have my concerns with this Bill
 
07:28:01.010 --> 07:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:01.020 --> 07:28:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:28:01.850 --> 07:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:05.570 --> 07:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
directly to you we were told we have the
 
07:28:08.750 --> 07:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
oldest housing market in the country we
 
07:28:12.430 --> 07:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
have a pathetic program for lead
 
07:28:16.010 --> 07:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
remediation compared to other states so
 
07:28:18.530 --> 07:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think there's I don't know about lead
 
07:28:20.330 --> 07:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
pipes but
 
07:28:22.430 --> 07:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a great need for this
 
07:28:25.070 --> 07:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
as so many people live in older older
 
07:28:27.530 --> 07:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
older homes in this state
 
07:28:31.548 --> 07:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:33.288 --> 07:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
um as a
 
07:28:35.750 --> 07:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
facilities director for
 
07:28:37.968 --> 07:28:37.978 align:start position:0%
Child Care Early Head Start and Head
 
07:28:41.150 --> 07:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
Start facilities in the Stratford County
 
07:28:41.160 --> 07:28:42.048 align:start position:0%
Start facilities in the Stratford County
area

07:28:42.048 --> 07:28:42.058 align:start position:0%
area
 
07:28:45.530 --> 07:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
a couple of our buildings are old
 
07:28:49.490 --> 07:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
and although the the walls and the trim
 
07:28:50.810 --> 07:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
has been painted a number of times
 
07:28:53.690 --> 07:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
they've essentially encapsulated
 
07:28:57.490 --> 07:28:57.500 align:start position:0%
existing lead pen paint underneath
 
07:28:59.628 --> 07:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
when a child
 
07:29:03.070 --> 07:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
that is in a classroom in the building
 
07:29:05.868 --> 07:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
is tested later
 
07:29:09.590 --> 07:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
and test positive for lead
 
07:29:12.350 --> 07:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
the entire building goes through
 
07:29:14.590 --> 07:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
a an intense
 
07:29:18.230 --> 07:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
search for where did is it did they get
 
07:29:20.390 --> 07:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
the lead from the building
 
07:29:23.530 --> 07:29:23.540 align:start position:0%
and that may result in the actually
 
07:29:25.850 --> 07:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
emptying out the building of the kids
 
07:29:29.030 --> 07:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
while that testing is accomplished and
 
07:29:32.690 --> 07:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out also
 
07:29:35.230 --> 07:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
or other kids in the in the building
 
07:29:39.708 --> 07:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
affected this program in doing this
 
07:29:42.530 --> 07:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
would limit
 
07:29:45.890 --> 07:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
the additional testing required and the
 
07:29:49.190 --> 07:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
impact on a small business that is
 
07:29:50.868 --> 07:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
trying to take care of children for
 
07:29:54.350 --> 07:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
people in their area so I'm all in favor
 
07:29:54.360 --> 07:29:56.150 align:start position:0%
people in their area so I'm all in favor
of

07:29:56.150 --> 07:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:29:59.270 --> 07:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you representative Weber
 
07:30:01.788 --> 07:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to point out that the
 
07:30:03.948 --> 07:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
the exception because we've we've talked
 
07:30:06.230 --> 07:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
about opt-ins and opt outs and all those
 
07:30:08.628 --> 07:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
different things but the exception on
 
07:30:13.910 --> 07:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
this for a parent is is absolute uh 130
 
07:30:17.208 --> 07:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
a colon 5C which is what was referred to
 
07:30:19.628 --> 07:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
in the bill the existing statute
 
07:30:22.250 --> 07:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
requires all parents or legal Guardians
 
07:30:24.410 --> 07:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
to have their uh
 
07:30:27.890 --> 07:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
child tested for blood lay level at the
 
07:30:30.890 --> 07:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
ages of one and two but then it says a
 
07:30:33.048 --> 07:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
child shall be exempt from this required
 
07:30:36.110 --> 07:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
blood level testing if a parent or legal
 
07:30:38.390 --> 07:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
guardian objects to such State Testing
 
07:30:40.850 --> 07:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
and provides a statement to such a fact
 
07:30:44.330 --> 07:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
so all they have to do is say
 
07:30:47.690 --> 07:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
I know that lead testing is required
 
07:30:51.590 --> 07:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
recommended but we're not going to so it
 
07:30:54.410 --> 07:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
leaves all of the power of the testing
 
07:30:56.468 --> 07:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the parent
 
07:30:58.610 --> 07:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:31:02.150 --> 07:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:05.510 --> 07:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief this is a mandate I don't
 
07:31:07.670 --> 07:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
support it I would rather see the law
 
07:31:07.680 --> 07:31:08.930 align:start position:0%
support it I would rather see the law
repealed

07:31:08.930 --> 07:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
07:31:11.390 --> 07:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
and that is all thank you
 
07:31:14.930 --> 07:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bill King
 
07:31:18.288 --> 07:31:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:20.208 --> 07:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
I have mixed feelings about this because
 
07:31:22.788 --> 07:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
I think the testing is good for the kids
 
07:31:26.410 --> 07:31:26.420 align:start position:0%
and for the parents if it's all about
 
07:31:29.390 --> 07:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
addressing the the lead issue in the
 
07:31:29.400 --> 07:31:30.590 align:start position:0%
addressing the the lead issue in the
child

07:31:30.590 --> 07:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
07:31:32.930 --> 07:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
but what ends up happening is a witch
 
07:31:35.690 --> 07:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
hunt starts as soon as you get a
 
07:31:36.948 --> 07:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
positive test
 
07:31:39.350 --> 07:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
and to representative Cannon's point
 
07:31:41.150 --> 07:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to shut down a building
 
07:31:43.430 --> 07:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to go in figure out
 
07:31:45.350 --> 07:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
where the lead is they're going to go to
 
07:31:47.628 --> 07:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
the landlord I actually have a
 
07:31:49.670 --> 07:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
constituent that's being evicted which I
 
07:31:52.010 --> 07:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
don't think is legal but she's actually
 
07:31:54.288 --> 07:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
being evicted because her child tested
 
07:31:57.048 --> 07:31:57.058 align:start position:0%
high on lead and it could have been at
 
07:31:58.670 --> 07:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
Grandma's house
 
07:32:00.468 --> 07:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's numerous
 
07:32:03.468 --> 07:32:03.478 align:start position:0%
places you can pick up lead my fear with
 
07:32:06.350 --> 07:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
laws like or bills like this and the law
 
07:32:08.270 --> 07:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
that we currently have in place I'm with
 
07:32:10.850 --> 07:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman that really needs
 
07:32:14.390 --> 07:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
to be repealed is that it creates a
 
07:32:16.490 --> 07:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
Witch Hunt and therefore I can't support
 
07:32:16.500 --> 07:32:17.868 align:start position:0%
Witch Hunt and therefore I can't support
it

07:32:17.868 --> 07:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:32:20.930 --> 07:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:20.940 --> 07:32:23.930 align:start position:0%
 
representative

um

07:32:24.590 --> 07:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:26.868 --> 07:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
six years ago I went apartment shopping

for my daughter and her husband who were
 
07:32:32.150 --> 07:32:32.160 align:start position:0%

07:32:35.448 --> 07:32:35.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:38.090 --> 07:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
a landlord has to prove that the
 
07:32:40.788 --> 07:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
apartment has been LED remediated if
 
07:32:43.310 --> 07:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to rent to people with
 
07:32:43.320 --> 07:32:44.628 align:start position:0%
they're going to rent to people with
children

07:32:44.628 --> 07:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:32:47.270 --> 07:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that's a standard that New
 
07:32:49.670 --> 07:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's not going to be able to be
 
07:32:53.750 --> 07:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
up to for a very long time but this is
 
07:32:53.760 --> 07:32:54.730 align:start position:0%
up to for a very long time but this is
about

07:32:54.730 --> 07:32:54.740 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:32:58.070 --> 07:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
safety and health of our children and I
 
07:33:01.610 --> 07:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
mean I can't read off
 
07:33:04.610 --> 07:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
the dire consequences of lead poisoning
 
07:33:07.010 --> 07:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
but maybe some of the doctors in our
 
07:33:09.110 --> 07:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
room could if we wanted to so I think
 
07:33:12.048 --> 07:33:12.058 align:start position:0%
this is a small step to keep children
 
07:33:12.058 --> 07:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
this is a small step to keep children
safe

07:33:13.750 --> 07:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
safe
 
07:33:16.070 --> 07:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
and of course it's a terrible
 
07:33:18.530 --> 07:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
inconvenience for landlords and and we
 
07:33:21.010 --> 07:33:21.020 align:start position:0%
had a landlord speak in front of us
 
07:33:24.468 --> 07:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
probably last year who said any program
 
07:33:26.868 --> 07:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire any
 
07:33:28.850 --> 07:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
amount of money that they could offer to
 
07:33:31.368 --> 07:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
help towards lead remediation would be
 
07:33:34.090 --> 07:33:34.100 align:start position:0%
so welcomed so I think
 
07:33:36.948 --> 07:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
that's where we should be working is to
 
07:33:40.070 --> 07:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
find more money for lead remediation and
 
07:33:41.990 --> 07:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
not say well let's not test the children
 
07:33:44.990 --> 07:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't know so
 
07:33:48.708 --> 07:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments I actually will
 
07:33:51.288 --> 07:33:51.298 align:start position:0%
make some comments as well myself
 
07:33:52.910 --> 07:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you know yet but you
 
07:33:54.708 --> 07:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
probably will soon I watch way too many
 
07:33:58.368 --> 07:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
Forensic Files and I remember Sunday's
 
07:34:01.430 --> 07:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
child she was a refugee child in
 
07:34:04.310 --> 07:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester who died unexplainedly until
 
07:34:07.070 --> 07:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
they found out that she had elevated
 
07:34:09.170 --> 07:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
levels they investigated everything
 
07:34:11.930 --> 07:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
around where she was and then they found
 
07:34:14.390 --> 07:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
out that she liked to spend time on the
 
07:34:17.150 --> 07:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
porch and so she had Pica and she was
 
07:34:20.208 --> 07:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
flaking off pieces of of paint on the
 
07:34:20.218 --> 07:34:21.468 align:start position:0%
flaking off pieces of of paint on the
porch

07:34:21.468 --> 07:34:21.478 align:start position:0%
porch
 
07:34:24.590 --> 07:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
that was in Manchester it hits home it
 
07:34:28.010 --> 07:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely is an issue and I do agree
 
07:34:29.750 --> 07:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
that what we need to do is be focusing
 
07:34:31.490 --> 07:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
and taking our attention to make sure
 
07:34:33.110 --> 07:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we can figure out ways in order to
 
07:34:35.930 --> 07:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
solve those problems I think that we
 
07:34:37.968 --> 07:34:37.978 align:start position:0%
have we do have the requirements in in
 
07:34:39.490 --> 07:34:39.500 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
07:34:42.530 --> 07:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
when we have this and we add yet another
 
07:34:45.650 --> 07:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
form for our yet another line I really
 
07:34:48.948 --> 07:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that this does include
 
07:34:51.170 --> 07:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
it removes any punishments on the
 
07:34:52.788 --> 07:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
facilities and the schools it makes it
 
07:34:55.190 --> 07:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
very clear again that this is up to you
 
07:34:56.990 --> 07:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
but here are the hazards and here's the
 
07:34:57.000 --> 07:34:58.490 align:start position:0%
but here are the hazards and here's the
information

07:34:58.490 --> 07:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:34:58.500 --> 07:34:59.570 align:start position:0%
information
um

07:34:59.570 --> 07:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:35:02.330 --> 07:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
but we're gonna have written materials
 
07:35:03.410 --> 07:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
that are printed out by the department
 
07:35:05.990 --> 07:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be handed out I actually went and I
 
07:35:07.310 --> 07:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
tried to get some nice informational
 
07:35:08.690 --> 07:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
handouts to distribute from the
 
07:35:10.670 --> 07:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
Department we don't print many just
 
07:35:12.468 --> 07:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
because the return on investment for the
 
07:35:14.150 --> 07:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
printed materials is on the lower side
 
07:35:14.160 --> 07:35:16.250 align:start position:0%
printed materials is on the lower side
and

07:35:16.250 --> 07:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:35:18.350 --> 07:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
I feel for these kids I feel for these
 
07:35:20.690 --> 07:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
situations but I feel like we might feel
 
07:35:22.128 --> 07:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
like we've done more than we actually
 
07:35:25.010 --> 07:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
have by passing this and so that's why
 
07:35:26.930 --> 07:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'll reluctantly be voting against it
 
07:35:28.610 --> 07:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
but I do I don't think that it actually
 
07:35:30.468 --> 07:35:30.478 align:start position:0%
furthers our goal of dealing with that
 
07:35:33.530 --> 07:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
core issue of lead in in the housing
 
07:35:36.530 --> 07:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
stock and that we also have issues of
 
07:35:37.788 --> 07:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
you know toys that are coming in with
 
07:35:39.650 --> 07:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
lead paint so you may have gone through
 
07:35:42.288 --> 07:35:42.298 align:start position:0%
the entire house displaced a family and
 
07:35:44.208 --> 07:35:44.218 align:start position:0%
then you find out that they're chewing
 
07:35:47.270 --> 07:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
on a rubber ducky that they got off the
 
07:35:48.830 --> 07:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
internet that's covered in red lead
 
07:35:51.590 --> 07:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
paint or the old one that we had that
 
07:35:54.350 --> 07:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
had the lead nugget fall out of the
 
07:35:56.330 --> 07:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
bottom of the rubber ducky that we had
 
07:35:58.250 --> 07:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
from my mom because it finally was loved
 
07:36:00.110 --> 07:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
enough that that piece fell out and
 
07:36:03.110 --> 07:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're nerds so we test our metals
 
07:36:05.810 --> 07:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
so it's a complex issue but I'm not sure
 
07:36:07.788 --> 07:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
this is well intentioned it moves a lot
 
07:36:09.350 --> 07:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
further but I'm not sure that it does
 
07:36:10.930 --> 07:36:10.940 align:start position:0%
what it does so
 
07:36:13.910 --> 07:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yeah I just add
 
07:36:15.530 --> 07:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
that I was just looking things up and
 
07:36:19.548 --> 07:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
the lead lead poisoning is
 
07:36:21.890 --> 07:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
twice the national average in New
 
07:36:23.930 --> 07:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's it's a significant
 
07:36:25.910 --> 07:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem here and maybe this doesn't take
 
07:36:27.410 --> 07:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
care of the whole problem but at least
 
07:36:30.230 --> 07:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
we maybe will get a better idea of where
 
07:36:31.730 --> 07:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
the problem is and I certainly agree
 
07:36:33.590 --> 07:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the whole idea about needing
 
07:36:36.770 --> 07:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
better programs for mitigation so that
 
07:36:40.490 --> 07:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
people don't get displaced but it I
 
07:36:42.708 --> 07:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
seems to me like this is a reasonable
 
07:36:44.628 --> 07:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
place to start so we know know where the
 
07:36:46.788 --> 07:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
problems are
 
07:36:48.770 --> 07:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
we may have a reasonable people disagree
 
07:36:50.208 --> 07:36:50.218 align:start position:0%
sort of one that we may want to vote
 
07:36:52.128 --> 07:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
move to voting on
 
07:36:54.048 --> 07:36:54.058 align:start position:0%
um is that I didn't mean to cut you off
 
07:36:55.610 --> 07:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative but if we're ready to
 
07:36:58.548 --> 07:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
move to have the clerk call the roll for
 
07:37:00.708 --> 07:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended by
 
07:37:00.718 --> 07:37:06.410 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended by
amendment2023-0842h

um

07:38:27.770 --> 07:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:29.208 --> 07:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
would you like to write the majority
 
07:38:31.610 --> 07:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
report representative Shapiro and do we
 
07:38:34.750 --> 07:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:36.830 --> 07:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take some of the others off with
 
07:38:38.208 --> 07:38:38.218 align:start position:0%
your plate but I'll give you the
 
07:38:41.570 --> 07:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:43.430 --> 07:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
you'll do The Minority Report fantastic
 
07:38:52.968 --> 07:38:52.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:52.978 --> 07:38:54.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:38:54.288 --> 07:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:56.390 --> 07:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
I know the next one on our list is 406
 
07:38:58.190 --> 07:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
but we're going to take another look
 
07:39:00.468 --> 07:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
um to an amendment on that one
 
07:39:02.208 --> 07:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to open the executive
 
07:39:05.030 --> 07:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 114 relative to
 
07:39:06.650 --> 07:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
the age at which a minor may receive
 
07:39:08.330 --> 07:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment without parental
 
07:39:13.548 --> 07:39:13.558 align:start position:0%
consent I have an amendment to that one
 
07:39:23.448 --> 07:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:27.350 --> 07:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I will make a motion to
 
07:39:30.610 --> 07:39:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:34.850 --> 07:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
2023-0036h on House Bill 114. is there a

2023-0036h on House Bill 114. is there a
second

07:39:36.770 --> 07:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:39:39.110 --> 07:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'll second to speak it was a second
 
07:39:42.708 --> 07:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
Mark okay perfect representative McLean
 
07:39:45.110 --> 07:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
so I will speak to the amendment
 
07:39:45.120 --> 07:39:48.190 align:start position:0%
so I will speak to the amendment
um

07:39:48.190 --> 07:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:51.230 --> 07:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
minors and especially teenagers in those
 
07:39:53.570 --> 07:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
difficult high school years really need
 
07:39:55.610 --> 07:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
somebody that they can trust to talk to
 
07:39:57.830 --> 07:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of parents want to make sure
 
07:39:58.850 --> 07:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
that there's somebody that they can
 
07:40:01.430 --> 07:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
trust to talk to as well especially when
 
07:40:02.690 --> 07:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
they know that there's guard rails
 
07:40:04.788 --> 07:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
around that conversation just to make
 
07:40:07.128 --> 07:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
sure that nobody's being influenced in
 
07:40:09.948 --> 07:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
one way or the other there's a
 
07:40:12.830 --> 07:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
definition of non-directive counseling
 
07:40:15.610 --> 07:40:15.620 align:start position:0%
from the American psychology Association
 
07:40:19.570 --> 07:40:19.580 align:start position:0%
that is what is on lines 13 through 15.
 
07:40:21.708 --> 07:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
basically it says that you're there
 
07:40:24.890 --> 07:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
there to listen there to talk and there
 
07:40:27.770 --> 07:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
to have basically have a safe place to
 
07:40:29.690 --> 07:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
experience your feelings your emotions
 
07:40:32.270 --> 07:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
and your challenges in order to be
 
07:40:35.750 --> 07:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
counseled but not guided this this is a
 
07:40:37.250 --> 07:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to wrap our head around
 
07:40:39.170 --> 07:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
because good medicine is non-directive
 
07:40:39.180 --> 07:40:40.250 align:start position:0%
because good medicine is non-directive
counseling

07:40:40.250 --> 07:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
07:40:42.410 --> 07:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
you would want directive counseling
 
07:40:43.968 --> 07:40:43.978 align:start position:0%
about how you're going to get rid of
 
07:40:46.310 --> 07:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
your cancer but when you're dealing with
 
07:40:48.890 --> 07:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
with personal issues that's less of an
 
07:40:52.190 --> 07:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
issue this is something where you want
 
07:40:53.990 --> 07:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
to know that who you're going to is
 
07:40:55.968 --> 07:40:55.978 align:start position:0%
going to listen to you and not steer you
 
07:40:57.788 --> 07:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
in any certain direction
 
07:41:02.208 --> 07:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:05.090 --> 07:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is also an area where you may look
 
07:41:06.830 --> 07:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
at this and say
 
07:41:08.208 --> 07:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
that there's areas where you'd want
 
07:41:09.650 --> 07:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
directive counseling I definitely want
 
07:41:11.868 --> 07:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
to direct somebody against suicide
 
07:41:14.570 --> 07:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
but do you want to Loop your parents in
 
07:41:16.070 --> 07:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
at that point because if you have a
 
07:41:20.510 --> 07:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
child who is suicidal the parents quite
 
07:41:21.948 --> 07:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
frankly I think the parents deserve an
 
07:41:24.110 --> 07:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sure that that child
 
07:41:25.310 --> 07:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
knows that they're loved and they're
 
07:41:27.230 --> 07:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
wanted and that they're supported at
 
07:41:29.570 --> 07:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
home because they may or may may not
 
07:41:31.548 --> 07:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
change the situations in which their
 
07:41:34.788 --> 07:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
child is and may or may not change how
 
07:41:36.468 --> 07:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
many eyes are cautiously looking around
 
07:41:39.468 --> 07:41:39.478 align:start position:0%
a corner to them just to make sure that
 
07:41:41.448 --> 07:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
they're not leaving them in a situation
 
07:41:43.490 --> 07:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
or leaving them unsupported after a
 
07:41:45.288 --> 07:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
particularly challenging encounter
 
07:41:47.810 --> 07:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
there's so many parents that at least on
 
07:41:49.368 --> 07:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
that that side where if they had only
 
07:41:50.510 --> 07:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
known there's something that they would
 
07:41:51.770 --> 07:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
have done differently
 
07:41:54.830 --> 07:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
and lives are left destroyed when you
 
07:41:56.690 --> 07:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
get to something like suicide that the
 
07:41:58.490 --> 07:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
parents really should be looped in so
 
07:42:00.650 --> 07:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
prohibiting non-prohibiting directive
 
07:42:00.660 --> 07:42:02.030 align:start position:0%
prohibiting non-prohibiting directive
counseling

07:42:02.030 --> 07:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
07:42:04.190 --> 07:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
um in that case
 
07:42:05.510 --> 07:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we should be looking
 
07:42:07.910 --> 07:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
at without consent of the the parents
 
07:42:07.920 --> 07:42:09.410 align:start position:0%
at without consent of the the parents
Guardian

07:42:09.410 --> 07:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
Guardian
 
07:42:12.650 --> 07:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
so um basically this is to make it
 
07:42:14.090 --> 07:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know I I think make a big
 
07:42:15.230 --> 07:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
Improvement where we can get a lot more
 
07:42:16.610 --> 07:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
agreement on this because there's so
 
07:42:19.788 --> 07:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
many other issues where we do argue
 
07:42:21.350 --> 07:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
um but this getting to non-directive
 
07:42:22.310 --> 07:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
counseling should be a lot less
 
07:42:25.490 --> 07:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
contentious representative Weber
 
07:42:30.708 --> 07:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:30.718 --> 07:42:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:42:32.270 --> 07:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:42:34.788 --> 07:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
the definition that's given here of
 
07:42:37.070 --> 07:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
non-directive counseling
 
07:42:41.270 --> 07:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
is that it seems to me that it would
 
07:42:42.770 --> 07:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
um prohibit
 
07:42:42.780 --> 07:42:44.590 align:start position:0%
um prohibit
the

07:42:44.590 --> 07:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:42:47.510 --> 07:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
counselor from saying
 
07:42:52.670 --> 07:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
from exploring with the kid gee is there
 
07:42:55.730 --> 07:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
a way that we can include your parents
 
07:42:58.368 --> 07:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
in this discussion which I think ought
 
07:42:59.628 --> 07:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
to be
 
07:43:02.868 --> 07:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
a very primary exploration
 
07:43:07.850 --> 07:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:10.190 --> 07:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that would be both
 
07:43:13.070 --> 07:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
giving advice and actively directing the
 
07:43:15.110 --> 07:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic process and the intended
 
07:43:15.120 --> 07:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
therapeutic process and the intended
outcome

07:43:16.390 --> 07:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
07:43:18.490 --> 07:43:18.500 align:start position:0%
if a
 
07:43:20.868 --> 07:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
therapist was
 
07:43:27.070 --> 07:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
working at getting the minor to explore
 
07:43:29.390 --> 07:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
ways of
 
07:43:31.788 --> 07:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
approaching their parents talking to
 
07:43:34.448 --> 07:43:34.458 align:start position:0%
their parents including their parents
 
07:43:37.730 --> 07:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
or repairing a relationship with parents
 
07:43:37.740 --> 07:43:39.708 align:start position:0%
or repairing a relationship with parents
so

07:43:39.708 --> 07:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:43:43.070 --> 07:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
um without with only a layperson's
 
07:43:44.810 --> 07:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
understanding of the English language
 
07:43:49.368 --> 07:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:53.270 --> 07:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
and and I I do I mean we agree that that
 
07:43:53.280 --> 07:43:54.590 align:start position:0%
and and I I do I mean we agree that that
having

07:43:54.590 --> 07:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
having
 
07:43:57.468 --> 07:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
familial involvement is
 
07:44:01.610 --> 07:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:04.390 --> 07:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative netting up
 
07:44:10.430 --> 07:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
them so I'm a psychotherapist and
 
07:44:15.468 --> 07:44:15.478 align:start position:0%
um non-direct this is impinging on my
 
07:44:15.478 --> 07:44:17.708 align:start position:0%
um non-direct this is impinging on my
practice

07:44:17.708 --> 07:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
practice
 
07:44:17.718 --> 07:44:19.368 align:start position:0%
practice
it's

07:44:19.368 --> 07:44:19.378 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:44:22.010 --> 07:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
not a real thing non-directive whatever
 
07:44:24.650 --> 07:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
and I think it's kind of come up because
 
07:44:27.890 --> 07:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
parents have been so concerned that
 
07:44:29.628 --> 07:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
therapists are talking their children
 
07:44:32.390 --> 07:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
into being gay I mean that's where I
 
07:44:35.990 --> 07:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
think this terminology came up from
 
07:44:36.000 --> 07:44:36.708 align:start position:0%
think this terminology came up from
um

07:44:36.708 --> 07:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:44:39.530 --> 07:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
when I and I have worked with a lot of
 
07:44:43.190 --> 07:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
children and I'm I'm not going against
 
07:44:46.730 --> 07:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
the parents you when you're counseling a
 
07:44:46.740 --> 07:44:48.288 align:start position:0%
the parents you when you're counseling a
child

07:44:48.288 --> 07:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
child
 
07:44:50.750 --> 07:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you meet with all of them yes you
 
07:44:52.490 --> 07:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
know what's going on here what are the
 
07:44:55.670 --> 07:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
problems what are the solutions
 
07:44:58.730 --> 07:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
um how are we what are our shared goals
 
07:45:01.730 --> 07:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
creating a treatment plan that involves
 
07:45:03.530 --> 07:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
07:45:05.810 --> 07:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
um sometimes I've had contentious
 
07:45:08.090 --> 07:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
parents where the child is living with
 
07:45:10.490 --> 07:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
one and the other one was abusive but
 
07:45:13.070 --> 07:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm obligated as a therapist to meet
 
07:45:15.548 --> 07:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
with that parent as well
 
07:45:18.530 --> 07:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation earlier today
 
07:45:18.540 --> 07:45:20.090 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation earlier today
about

07:45:20.090 --> 07:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:45:20.100 --> 07:45:22.368 align:start position:0%
about
um

07:45:22.368 --> 07:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:25.490 --> 07:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
many of us therapists some parents think
 
07:45:28.090 --> 07:45:28.100 align:start position:0%
that we keep a Verbatim
 
07:45:30.530 --> 07:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
notation of everything that was said
 
07:45:32.930 --> 07:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
during counseling which we don't it
 
07:45:34.788 --> 07:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
would be impossible and I wouldn't
 
07:45:36.530 --> 07:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
record it because I think that's an
 
07:45:39.830 --> 07:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
invasion of of privacy but
 
07:45:39.840 --> 07:45:42.530 align:start position:0%
invasion of of privacy but
um

07:45:42.530 --> 07:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:46.010 --> 07:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
um representative you had a wonderful
 
07:45:48.890 --> 07:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
saying about the presumed best intention
 
07:45:51.048 --> 07:45:51.058 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
07:45:54.770 --> 07:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
um in a bill earlier and I feel that way
 
07:45:57.830 --> 07:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
with therapists that most of them
 
07:46:01.430 --> 07:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
have the best interest of their client
 
07:46:05.270 --> 07:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the client's family atmosphere and
 
07:46:07.070 --> 07:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
the and the clients
 
07:46:12.288 --> 07:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
whole milieu in mind so I don't think
 
07:46:15.288 --> 07:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
this is an unneeded bill
 
07:46:15.298 --> 07:46:16.730 align:start position:0%
this is an unneeded bill
um

07:46:16.730 --> 07:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:46:19.070 --> 07:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment so
 
07:46:21.830 --> 07:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I'm happy to talk more
 
07:46:23.628 --> 07:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
off the clock because I know it's been a
 
07:46:27.288 --> 07:46:27.298 align:start position:0%
long day but um you know you have your
 
07:46:31.010 --> 07:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
best outcomes with a client when you can
 
07:46:32.510 --> 07:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
involve their
 
07:46:34.968 --> 07:46:34.978 align:start position:0%
family with them I mean you have an hour
 
07:46:37.010 --> 07:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
a week with them they have all the rest
 
07:46:39.410 --> 07:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the time with them so when you can
 
07:46:42.708 --> 07:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
affect effect effectively a family
 
07:46:44.810 --> 07:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
structure or maybe how they interact
 
07:46:47.150 --> 07:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
with each other that's going to have the
 
07:46:51.890 --> 07:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
best outcome for the child so I I don't
 
07:46:54.350 --> 07:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
have to be more diplomatic than I want
 
07:46:55.670 --> 07:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
to be here
 
07:46:59.030 --> 07:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of threatening language
 
07:47:01.368 --> 07:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
to a therapist
 
07:47:04.190 --> 07:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
um that is is not needed
 
07:47:06.230 --> 07:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you I guess to
 
07:47:08.090 --> 07:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
respond to that this was to try and
 
07:47:11.090 --> 07:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
Bridge a bit of that Chasm my opposition
 
07:47:12.830 --> 07:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill as written is actually the
 
07:47:15.170 --> 07:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
same thing as yours that the best
 
07:47:16.730 --> 07:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
outcomes come when the family is
 
07:47:19.670 --> 07:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
involved so having an easier process in
 
07:47:22.368 --> 07:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
order to have this therapy specifically
 
07:47:24.410 --> 07:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
cutting out the family was my concern
 
07:47:26.690 --> 07:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
because it's hard to work with those
 
07:47:28.070 --> 07:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
parents when they're not part of this
 
07:47:30.770 --> 07:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
process and that they are not
 
07:47:32.448 --> 07:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
um there's not consent from those
 
07:47:34.490 --> 07:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
parents so this was my attempt to bridge
 
07:47:36.230 --> 07:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
a gap in order to find something where
 
07:47:37.850 --> 07:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
maybe we could all get agreement and
 
07:47:40.330 --> 07:47:40.340 align:start position:0%
then move this thing through with
 
07:47:43.910 --> 07:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic consent support but that
 
07:47:45.530 --> 07:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
may not be the kid that appears not to
 
07:47:47.628 --> 07:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
be the case so maybe it makes sense for
 
07:47:49.250 --> 07:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
us I don't want to limit what anybody is
 
07:47:50.690 --> 07:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
saying but if there's if there's a
 
07:47:52.010 --> 07:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
significant difference of opinion on
 
07:47:53.930 --> 07:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment perhaps it's worth doing
 
07:47:55.788 --> 07:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
a vote on it seeing where it lies and
 
07:47:58.310 --> 07:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
then playing on yeah is there any
 
07:48:02.448 --> 07:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
opposition to that happy to help rewrite
 
07:48:05.090 --> 07:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
an amendment that you would like to
 
07:48:06.890 --> 07:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
rewrite an amendment with me before next
 
07:48:09.410 --> 07:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
week to get to that yeah yeah let's do
 
07:48:11.990 --> 07:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
that okay if you have representative
 
07:48:12.000 --> 07:48:14.530 align:start position:0%
that okay if you have representative
McKay

07:48:14.530 --> 07:48:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:17.270 --> 07:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
could you put your microphone on
 
07:48:17.280 --> 07:48:19.930 align:start position:0%
could you put your microphone on
Christmas

07:48:19.930 --> 07:48:19.940 align:start position:0%
Christmas
 
07:48:23.090 --> 07:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
perturbed by this legislation that I am
 
07:48:26.288 --> 07:48:26.298 align:start position:0%
totally opposed to the legislature
 
07:48:26.298 --> 07:48:27.968 align:start position:0%
totally opposed to the legislature
prescribing

07:48:27.968 --> 07:48:27.978 align:start position:0%
prescribing
 
07:48:31.368 --> 07:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy practice any more than I
 
07:48:34.850 --> 07:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
would tell Dr Murphy how to do his
 
07:48:37.788 --> 07:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
business and I would wouldn't have a
 
07:48:41.208 --> 07:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
clue as to how to do that I don't think
 
07:48:45.670 --> 07:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature should be be so specific
 
07:48:52.150 --> 07:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
as to prescribe a specific type of
 
07:48:56.628 --> 07:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
approach a Psychotherapy is a licensed
 
07:49:00.230 --> 07:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
practice and it's licensed to several
 
07:49:02.750 --> 07:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
different groups including social
 
07:49:06.708 --> 07:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
workers and psychologists and so on
 
07:49:08.530 --> 07:49:08.540 align:start position:0%
that this
 
07:49:11.810 --> 07:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
assumes that the legislature knows more
 
07:49:15.170 --> 07:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
than the professional licensed person
 
07:49:18.730 --> 07:49:18.740 align:start position:0%
as to how to practice their their
 
07:49:22.490 --> 07:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
profession I I think it's heading in a
 
07:49:25.430 --> 07:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
very dangerous Direction and I certainly
 
07:49:27.770 --> 07:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
would oppose it thank you would you be
 
07:49:29.448 --> 07:49:29.458 align:start position:0%
willing to work with representative
 
07:49:29.458 --> 07:49:31.150 align:start position:0%
willing to work with representative
another

07:49:31.150 --> 07:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
07:49:33.948 --> 07:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
my good friend
 
07:49:36.770 --> 07:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
um my good friend from Nashua
 
07:49:38.270 --> 07:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
um to see if there is an amendment that
 
07:49:39.230 --> 07:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
would work
 
07:49:40.788 --> 07:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
um so that we can see if we can come to
 
07:49:43.490 --> 07:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
something for next week we'll take a
 
07:49:46.010 --> 07:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
look at it always willing to work with
 
07:49:48.770 --> 07:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
my friend but the end result as far as
 
07:49:51.288 --> 07:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned is already there
 
07:49:53.690 --> 07:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you so that's not a very positive
 
07:49:53.700 --> 07:49:55.128 align:start position:0%
thank you so that's not a very positive
first

07:49:55.128 --> 07:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
first
 
07:49:58.548 --> 07:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative Selleck I'm
 
07:50:00.288 --> 07:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
sorry I just want to contribute just as
 
07:50:02.810 --> 07:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
a parent of two teenagers
 
07:50:05.330 --> 07:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and someone who went through therapy
 
07:50:08.030 --> 07:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
both as a teenager and as an adult
 
07:50:11.990 --> 07:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
the therapist's goals for all have been
 
07:50:15.770 --> 07:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
driven by the need of the client and you
 
07:50:18.590 --> 07:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
know so that if my kid needed guidance
 
07:50:20.510 --> 07:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
one of them needed school specific
 
07:50:23.208 --> 07:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
guidance and ideas about how to navigate
 
07:50:25.490 --> 07:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
School situations
 
07:50:29.150 --> 07:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
and so she would have absolutely needed
 
07:50:31.010 --> 07:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
her therapist to direct the process
 
07:50:32.510 --> 07:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
because the issue was she didn't know
 
07:50:33.888 --> 07:50:33.898 align:start position:0%
how to navigate things from the first
 
07:50:37.490 --> 07:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
place and so to to take that ability
 
07:50:38.990 --> 07:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
away from the therapist would have
 
07:50:40.670 --> 07:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
completely negated
 
07:50:43.250 --> 07:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
the goal of her being in therapy
 
07:50:44.810 --> 07:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
um now I was aware obviously she was in
 
07:50:44.820 --> 07:50:45.770 align:start position:0%
um now I was aware obviously she was in
therapy

07:50:45.770 --> 07:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
07:50:48.048 --> 07:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
um but had she chosen to go find a
 
07:50:49.968 --> 07:50:49.978 align:start position:0%
therapist to work with without us I
 
07:50:51.530 --> 07:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
would have been incredibly grateful for
 
07:50:53.868 --> 07:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
her to get the support that she needs
 
07:50:56.388 --> 07:50:56.398 align:start position:0%
and and I'm the kind of parent who loves
 
07:50:58.548 --> 07:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
my kids no matter what
 
07:51:00.888 --> 07:51:00.898 align:start position:0%
um I'm also a former teacher and know
 
07:51:02.930 --> 07:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
how many kids don't have parents who
 
07:51:05.930 --> 07:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
love them no matter what and helping
 
07:51:08.810 --> 07:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
those kids find resources so they could
 
07:51:10.968 --> 07:51:10.978 align:start position:0%
have safe spaces to talk about the
 
07:51:10.978 --> 07:51:12.770 align:start position:0%
have safe spaces to talk about the
Dynamics

07:51:12.770 --> 07:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
 
07:51:16.190 --> 07:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
um was crucial and and finding them ways
 
07:51:20.090 --> 07:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
to help them stay alive and make it till
 
07:51:21.468 --> 07:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
their 18th birthday when they could
 
07:51:23.208 --> 07:51:23.218 align:start position:0%
choose to do these things whether or not
 
07:51:26.030 --> 07:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
their parents were involved and so you
 
07:51:28.128 --> 07:51:28.138 align:start position:0%
know I'm in favor of the original bill
 
07:51:31.548 --> 07:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
but this amendment to me puts children
 
07:51:35.208 --> 07:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
in danger and and so that offers me
 
07:51:36.888 --> 07:51:36.898 align:start position:0%
concern and I'm happy to come in if you
 
07:51:38.448 --> 07:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
want me to consult with you at some
 
07:51:41.030 --> 07:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
point either by phone or in person I'm
 
07:51:43.270 --> 07:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
happy to contribute to your committee
 
07:51:46.910 --> 07:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yeah
 
07:51:46.920 --> 07:51:48.048 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yeah
um

07:51:48.048 --> 07:51:48.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:51:50.510 --> 07:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your effort to kind of
 
07:51:53.990 --> 07:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
bridge a gap between two very important
 
07:51:56.208 --> 07:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
principles that there are mature miners
 
07:51:58.250 --> 07:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
who would benefit by being able to
 
07:52:00.888 --> 07:52:00.898 align:start position:0%
consent to their own treatment and the
 
07:52:04.250 --> 07:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
fact that the best treatment includes
 
07:52:06.590 --> 07:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
is relational treatment you know is
 
07:52:06.600 --> 07:52:07.968 align:start position:0%
is relational treatment you know is
affects

07:52:07.968 --> 07:52:07.978 align:start position:0%
affects
 
07:52:11.448 --> 07:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
um people's life relationships and the
 
07:52:13.548 --> 07:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
family is the most part of that the most
 
07:52:15.230 --> 07:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
important part of that so I appreciate
 
07:52:16.910 --> 07:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
the effort to
 
07:52:19.368 --> 07:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
um bridge that Gap I think
 
07:52:22.610 --> 07:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
you know the problem I think is that
 
07:52:23.990 --> 07:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
well when you know when there was
 
07:52:26.570 --> 07:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
Freudian analysis and people lied on a
 
07:52:29.090 --> 07:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
couch five days a week and somebody sat
 
07:52:31.430 --> 07:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
behind them and people talked about
 
07:52:35.570 --> 07:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
their fantasies and their dreams and um
 
07:52:36.888 --> 07:52:36.898 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:52:39.110 --> 07:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
the I the idea was that there was a
 
07:52:41.330 --> 07:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
neutral screen the therapist was
 
07:52:42.708 --> 07:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to be completely neutral you
 
07:52:44.930 --> 07:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
weren't even supposed to see them but
 
07:52:47.388 --> 07:52:47.398 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me that going into a room
 
07:52:49.610 --> 07:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
like that and lying on a couch and going
 
07:52:51.530 --> 07:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
through that process doesn't influence
 
07:52:54.468 --> 07:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
the situation I think it's impossible to
 
07:52:56.350 --> 07:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
be completely
 
07:52:59.448 --> 07:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
non-directive I mean I think the very
 
07:53:02.810 --> 07:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
Act of engaging with someone
 
07:53:05.090 --> 07:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
changes the process
 
07:53:07.968 --> 07:53:07.978 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
07:53:10.368 --> 07:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
I can't really conceive of any other
 
07:53:12.948 --> 07:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
amendment that would bridge the gap but
 
07:53:16.010 --> 07:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
if there was some way to
 
07:53:18.770 --> 07:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
let miners
 
07:53:21.590 --> 07:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
consent to their treatment and at the
 
07:53:23.570 --> 07:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
same time encourage
 
07:53:26.330 --> 07:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
involvement of the family
 
07:53:30.048 --> 07:53:30.058 align:start position:0%
without prescribing it I think that you
 
07:53:31.310 --> 07:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
know if there's some way to find
 
07:53:33.770 --> 07:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
something like that I would I would
 
07:53:36.288 --> 07:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a good thing
 
07:53:37.968 --> 07:53:37.978 align:start position:0%
thank you I actually do want to speak to
 
07:53:38.930 --> 07:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
one of the things that representative
 
07:53:42.288 --> 07:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
Selleck brought up RC Lake brought up I
 
07:53:44.628 --> 07:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
I think that what you're seeing is a lot
 
07:53:47.030 --> 07:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
of students who feel that their parents
 
07:53:48.770 --> 07:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
don't support them because there's a lot
 
07:53:50.570 --> 07:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
of parents some of those are ones that
 
07:53:52.128 --> 07:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
truly don't support them but there's
 
07:53:53.868 --> 07:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
other ones that don't unders don't
 
07:53:55.850 --> 07:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
recognize that so figuring out some way
 
07:53:58.670 --> 07:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
to bridge that Gap in not the ones who
 
07:54:00.288 --> 07:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
know that they have loving parents and
 
07:54:01.730 --> 07:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
the ones that know that they have
 
07:54:03.350 --> 07:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
unloving parents because both of those
 
07:54:05.388 --> 07:54:05.398 align:start position:0%
are true but somewhere in that muddy
 
07:54:07.128 --> 07:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
middle there are plenty of kids that
 
07:54:09.170 --> 07:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
don't understand how much their parents
 
07:54:11.030 --> 07:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
care because their parents aren't good
 
07:54:12.530 --> 07:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
at communicating either and
 
07:54:13.910 --> 07:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that just because you
 
07:54:15.830 --> 07:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that your parent cares isn't
 
07:54:17.570 --> 07:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that's necessarily the
 
07:54:19.010 --> 07:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
truth I guess I just want to make sure
 
07:54:20.690 --> 07:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
that these kids don't feel hopeless if
 
07:54:22.868 --> 07:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
that's what their perception is
 
07:54:25.368 --> 07:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so I
 
07:54:28.128 --> 07:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
I'm literally talking about kids and you
 
07:54:30.770 --> 07:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
know I haven't had to make the calls to
 
07:54:34.010 --> 07:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
dcyf on behalf of those children
 
07:54:36.708 --> 07:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
um whose parents couldn't accept them
 
07:54:38.810 --> 07:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
for who they were whether it was a
 
07:54:41.090 --> 07:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
difference in religious views or whether
 
07:54:43.010 --> 07:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
it had to do with something else
 
07:54:47.090 --> 07:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
but if kids feel truly feel and believe
 
07:54:49.128 --> 07:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
in their core that they can't talk to
 
07:54:50.628 --> 07:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
their parents and can't even express to
 
07:54:52.670 --> 07:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
them that they need help
 
07:54:54.830 --> 07:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
giving them a way to access it because
 
07:54:56.330 --> 07:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
maybe what will happen with their
 
07:54:58.250 --> 07:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
therapist who is able to direct the
 
07:55:01.788 --> 07:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
treatment it to some degree is that the
 
07:55:03.590 --> 07:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
therapist will say wow I hear you saying
 
07:55:05.208 --> 07:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
your parents don't love you because they
 
07:55:07.610 --> 07:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
expect you to keep your room neat
 
07:55:09.708 --> 07:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
let's break that down and think about
 
07:55:11.388 --> 07:55:11.398 align:start position:0%
what's really behind it and maybe they
 
07:55:14.090 --> 07:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
can help them see past those things that
 
07:55:15.650 --> 07:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know adolescents are adolescents for
 
07:55:17.030 --> 07:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
a reason right they're prefrontal
 
07:55:20.570 --> 07:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
cortexes aren't fully developed you know
 
07:55:24.770 --> 07:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
but giving them a a way
 
07:55:28.128 --> 07:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
in my mind giving kids any light in the
 
07:55:28.138 --> 07:55:28.910 align:start position:0%
in my mind giving kids any light in the
dark

07:55:28.910 --> 07:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
dark
 
07:55:31.128 --> 07:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
is so much more important than the
 
07:55:33.468 --> 07:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
potential risk of leaving them in the
 
07:55:36.170 --> 07:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
dark and and it's just crucial to find
 
07:55:38.690 --> 07:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
ways to help kids and if we look at all
 
07:55:40.548 --> 07:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
of the studies now the impacts of covet
 
07:55:42.708 --> 07:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
and the isolation and the impacts of
 
07:55:43.910 --> 07:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
social media
 
07:55:45.708 --> 07:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
the levels of anxiety and stress for
 
07:55:48.468 --> 07:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
children are so high that just helping
 
07:55:50.090 --> 07:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
them find any access whatever that may
 
07:55:52.128 --> 07:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
be is crucial
 
07:55:54.468 --> 07:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess um I'll take that
 
07:55:55.910 --> 07:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment my other part is I didn't know
 
07:55:57.410 --> 07:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'll take your comment and
 
07:55:57.420 --> 07:55:58.850 align:start position:0%
I'll take your comment and
representative

07:55:58.850 --> 07:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:56:02.330 --> 07:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'm skeptical about I think
 
07:56:04.310 --> 07:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
underlying bill goes too far but
 
07:56:06.888 --> 07:56:06.898 align:start position:0%
speaking about this amendment and what
 
07:56:09.708 --> 07:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
the representative select said I would
 
07:56:14.288 --> 07:56:14.298 align:start position:0%
agree that a therapists need to
 
07:56:17.868 --> 07:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
detect the process but it's a question
 
07:56:20.350 --> 07:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
of definitions a difference between
 
07:56:23.330 --> 07:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
directing the process and electing a
 
07:56:26.750 --> 07:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
child and they're definitely a directive
 
07:56:30.350 --> 07:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
ways ways to do therapy and
 
07:56:34.010 --> 07:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
non-delective ways to do counseling for
 
07:56:34.020 --> 07:56:35.650 align:start position:0%
non-delective ways to do counseling for
example

07:56:35.650 --> 07:56:35.660 align:start position:0%
example
 
07:56:39.590 --> 07:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
can say okay think about your problem
 
07:56:42.310 --> 07:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
put positives
 
07:56:45.770 --> 07:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
signs on the left side of your list put
 
07:56:48.530 --> 07:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
negatives on the right side of your list
 
07:56:51.468 --> 07:56:51.478 align:start position:0%
now think what you should do so the
 
07:56:54.170 --> 07:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
therapist definitely
 
07:56:58.190 --> 07:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
direct the process but he or she doesn't
 
07:57:01.548 --> 07:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
direct the child's decision to make so
 
07:57:01.558 --> 07:57:02.948 align:start position:0%
direct the child's decision to make so
definitely

07:57:02.948 --> 07:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
07:57:06.230 --> 07:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's a way to to be non-delective but
 
07:57:08.990 --> 07:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
give the kids light in the dark they
 
07:57:11.930 --> 07:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
need help them to get rid of anxiety
 
07:57:14.270 --> 07:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
while doing non-directive counseling
 
07:57:16.430 --> 07:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I'd like to see if we
 
07:57:18.288 --> 07:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
can do a straw poll to see
 
07:57:19.610 --> 07:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
how many people just
 
07:57:21.288 --> 07:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
left any Amendment many ways and if
 
07:57:24.048 --> 07:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
that's the case then there's no need to
 
07:57:25.850 --> 07:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
spin our Wheels we can vote and then
 
07:57:28.850 --> 07:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
move forward so is there anybody who is
 
07:57:30.410 --> 07:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
just going to be in support and not not
 
07:57:33.170 --> 07:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
take not go with any Amendment because
 
07:57:34.788 --> 07:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
if that's the case we might as well go
 
07:57:36.410 --> 07:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
ahead and vote on the money or is that
 
07:57:39.350 --> 07:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
is that appropriate representative Weber
 
07:57:41.810 --> 07:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly appropriate but I I can't
 
07:57:43.368 --> 07:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
tell you whether I would accept an
 
07:57:44.810 --> 07:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
amendment or not till I saw the
 
07:57:46.968 --> 07:57:46.978 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean the the concern that I
 
07:57:50.030 --> 07:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
have is I'm entirely in sympathy with
 
07:57:53.330 --> 07:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
everything that representative whose
 
07:57:54.948 --> 07:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
name I cannot pronounce and I'm sorry
 
07:57:57.170 --> 07:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
because I don't remember names anyway
 
07:57:59.990 --> 07:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I really am very sorry about that so
 
07:58:03.830 --> 07:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
think how awful it is with pronouns uh
 
07:58:07.968 --> 07:58:07.978 align:start position:0%
but what I am very aware of
 
07:58:12.110 --> 07:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
well one of the things I think that what
 
07:58:14.388 --> 07:58:14.398 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is covered by the
 
07:58:18.110 --> 07:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
ethical and standards of practice
 
07:58:20.270 --> 07:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh under which
 
07:58:22.368 --> 07:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
counselors of all different kinds
 
07:58:24.410 --> 07:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
operate because what they are supposed
 
07:58:29.830 --> 07:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be doing is helping the individual
 
07:58:29.840 --> 07:58:31.388 align:start position:0%
to be doing is helping the individual
achieve

07:58:31.388 --> 07:58:31.398 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
07:58:36.170 --> 07:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
the individual's goals but so that
 
07:58:38.388 --> 07:58:38.398 align:start position:0%
there's that on the one hand but what I
 
07:58:40.570 --> 07:58:40.580 align:start position:0%
do know is that
 
07:58:43.930 --> 07:58:43.940 align:start position:0%
the way you phrase any question
 
07:58:46.430 --> 07:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
matters and
 
07:58:48.230 --> 07:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
07:58:52.850 --> 07:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
and the way whatever a therapist chooses
 
07:58:56.868 --> 07:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
to say next is in some way a direction
 
07:59:00.230 --> 07:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I I will give you one example I used
 
07:59:02.810 --> 07:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
to be a guardian for elders who didn't
 
07:59:05.170 --> 07:59:05.180 align:start position:0%
have anybody
 
07:59:10.490 --> 07:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
familial or or otherwise related and I
 
07:59:13.128 --> 07:59:13.138 align:start position:0%
could go and say to an elderly woman
 
07:59:15.530 --> 07:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
lying on a hospital bed
 
07:59:19.010 --> 07:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
do you want to have an operation this is
 
07:59:21.770 --> 07:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
this is the operation and she would say
 
07:59:24.230 --> 07:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
no I don't want to have an operation and
 
07:59:26.350 --> 07:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
if I said
 
07:59:29.388 --> 07:59:29.398 align:start position:0%
Dr Smith your doctor
 
07:59:31.788 --> 07:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
recommends that you have this operation
 
07:59:36.350 --> 07:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
she would say oh all right and sorting
 
07:59:36.360 --> 07:59:37.730 align:start position:0%
she would say oh all right and sorting
out

07:59:37.730 --> 07:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:59:41.208 --> 07:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
whether you know what her motivations
 
07:59:41.218 --> 07:59:42.350 align:start position:0%
whether you know what her motivations
were

07:59:42.350 --> 07:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:59:44.888 --> 07:59:44.898 align:start position:0%
and whether she truly
 
07:59:47.990 --> 07:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
understood and and to what extent she
 
07:59:50.570 --> 07:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
understood what she was answering and
 
07:59:52.510 --> 07:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
and telling me what she really wanted
 
07:59:58.610 --> 07:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:00.530 --> 08:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that helps at all but it's
 
08:00:03.410 --> 08:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's what informs my concern and I
 
08:00:05.208 --> 08:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
would rather leave that
 
08:00:08.930 --> 08:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
my choice is to leave that decision to
 
08:00:11.690 --> 08:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
those who have put in an enormous amount
 
08:00:19.310 --> 08:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:21.350 --> 08:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion to what you were suggesting
 
08:00:23.090 --> 08:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
if we do a straw poll of those who would
 
08:00:25.128 --> 08:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
just vote against the underlying Bill no
 
08:00:28.548 --> 08:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
matter what is amended on it because on
 
08:00:30.468 --> 08:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
principle we are against
 
08:00:33.948 --> 08:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
giving away parents rights over their
 
08:00:36.830 --> 08:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
children might prove
 
08:00:39.048 --> 08:00:39.058 align:start position:0%
that we can vote on this now I think
 
08:00:40.548 --> 08:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
maybe what I should do is just withdraw
 
08:00:42.110 --> 08:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
my Amendment and then we should just
 
08:00:45.350 --> 08:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
move to another motion so I'll withdraw
 
08:00:47.930 --> 08:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
my amendments and she'll Mark
 
08:00:49.128 --> 08:00:49.138 align:start position:0%
representative McLean while you're
 
08:00:51.590 --> 08:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal okay and I do think we've
 
08:00:53.810 --> 08:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
discussed this issue quite a bit I'm not
 
08:00:55.310 --> 08:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
sure if there's anything else to add oh
 
08:00:57.770 --> 08:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
sorry we do have a motion
 
08:01:00.888 --> 08:01:00.898 align:start position:0%
um ref does representative Shapiro want
 
08:01:02.990 --> 08:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
to make a motion a representative McKay
 
08:01:04.670 --> 08:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who would like to make a
 
08:01:06.888 --> 08:01:06.898 align:start position:0%
motion on this one
 
08:01:06.898 --> 08:01:08.448 align:start position:0%
motion on this one
yeah

08:01:08.448 --> 08:01:08.458 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
08:01:13.010 --> 08:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion um I move that we
 
08:01:21.530 --> 08:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:23.388 --> 08:01:23.398 align:start position:0%
we get a second should I have instead
 
08:01:25.548 --> 08:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
had somebody move on itl so that we're
 
08:01:27.410 --> 08:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
not closing off our other options should
 
08:01:30.170 --> 08:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
itl not pass
 
08:01:32.030 --> 08:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're not closing off our options either
 
08:01:34.070 --> 08:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
well because if there's an ought to pass
 
08:01:36.590 --> 08:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't if somebody wants to
 
08:01:38.090 --> 08:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
reconsider anybody can move
 
08:01:39.888 --> 08:01:39.898 align:start position:0%
reconsideration as long as the chair
 
08:01:42.650 --> 08:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
hasn't sent the bill off to the clerk's
 
08:01:44.810 --> 08:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
office regardless of how they voted okay
 
08:01:44.820 --> 08:01:46.788 align:start position:0%
office regardless of how they voted okay
perfect

08:01:46.788 --> 08:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
08:01:48.770 --> 08:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
I would just say it's fine with me
 
08:01:54.468 --> 08:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:55.788 --> 08:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
08:01:58.010 --> 08:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
a second we'll go
 
08:02:00.350 --> 08:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
actually let me look at my computer and
 
08:02:02.448 --> 08:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
see what my mouth I'll second his motion
 
08:02:04.910 --> 08:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful
 
08:02:06.350 --> 08:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my cheat sheet to say
 
08:02:12.468 --> 08:02:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:14.510 --> 08:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
um actually that
 
08:02:14.520 --> 08:02:15.708 align:start position:0%
um actually that
okay

08:02:15.708 --> 08:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:02:15.718 --> 08:02:17.468 align:start position:0%
okay
um

08:02:17.468 --> 08:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:02:20.330 --> 08:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
well I'll ask the clerk to call the roll
 
08:02:23.750 --> 08:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
on oh yes I'm sorry representative South
 
08:02:25.548 --> 08:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
King okay thank you sorry
 
08:02:25.558 --> 08:02:26.868 align:start position:0%
King okay thank you sorry
um perhaps

08:02:26.868 --> 08:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
um perhaps
 
08:02:29.208 --> 08:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
um if I had spoken earlier we could have
 
08:02:31.430 --> 08:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
saved time so I apologize I find myself
 
08:02:34.610 --> 08:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
in the unenviable position of
 
08:02:37.850 --> 08:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
um going against my vice chair and
 
08:02:40.070 --> 08:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
siding with the opposition party on this
 
08:02:40.080 --> 08:02:41.388 align:start position:0%
siding with the opposition party on this
bill

08:02:41.388 --> 08:02:41.398 align:start position:0%
bill
 
08:02:41.398 --> 08:02:42.230 align:start position:0%
bill
um

08:02:42.230 --> 08:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:02:44.628 --> 08:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
I can understand why
 
08:02:46.190 --> 08:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
um with the amendment you would want
 
08:02:48.410 --> 08:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
something that you could more likely get
 
08:02:51.708 --> 08:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
behind however uh therapists at least
 
08:02:54.170 --> 08:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
the majority of them are not paid and
 
08:02:56.510 --> 08:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
run by the government so
 
08:02:57.948 --> 08:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
um if they were paid or run by the
 
08:02:59.350 --> 08:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
government I could sort of understand
 
08:03:01.490 --> 08:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
more or less controlling what they're
 
08:03:03.170 --> 08:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
allowed to say and do but since they're
 
08:03:05.510 --> 08:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
not controlled by the gov or not run and
 
08:03:07.368 --> 08:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
paid by the government I feel like
 
08:03:09.048 --> 08:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
anything that would restrict their
 
08:03:12.288 --> 08:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
speech would be inappropriate
 
08:03:14.208 --> 08:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
we're we're speaking to the original
 
08:03:16.430 --> 08:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
Bill not the amendment at this point is
 
08:03:17.690 --> 08:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
that correct yes we're speaking to the
 
08:03:20.030 --> 08:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
original okay fair enough so
 
08:03:22.430 --> 08:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
um to get back to the original Bill the
 
08:03:25.788 --> 08:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
reason why I support this bill is
 
08:03:29.388 --> 08:03:29.398 align:start position:0%
because there was a time that kids
 
08:03:31.430 --> 08:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
um used to be able to say it's a free
 
08:03:34.070 --> 08:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
country I can do what I want and I don't
 
08:03:35.708 --> 08:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
think they say that anymore
 
08:03:38.208 --> 08:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
not too long ago kids used to be able to
 
08:03:39.590 --> 08:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
bring guns to school and that was
 
08:03:41.388 --> 08:03:41.398 align:start position:0%
totally fine they used to be able to go
 
08:03:42.830 --> 08:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
to a vending machine and get a pack of
 
08:03:45.230 --> 08:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
smokes and that was totally fine we have
 
08:03:47.330 --> 08:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
totally over regulated what children are
 
08:03:49.490 --> 08:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to do nowadays and so when it
 
08:03:50.868 --> 08:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
comes to this bill
 
08:03:53.448 --> 08:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
this is simply allowing them to talk to
 
08:03:54.530 --> 08:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
other people at the end of the day
 
08:03:55.610 --> 08:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's what it comes down to they're
 
08:03:58.128 --> 08:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk to somebody else and um
 
08:04:00.350 --> 08:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
I fully understand the culture wars that
 
08:04:02.750 --> 08:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
are being waged I'm not happy with what
 
08:04:05.388 --> 08:04:05.398 align:start position:0%
the left is doing but if you haven't as
 
08:04:08.388 --> 08:04:08.398 align:start position:0%
a parent uh instructed your child by the
 
08:04:11.150 --> 08:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
age of 16 about what's going on in the
 
08:04:13.670 --> 08:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
world and they decide to go and do
 
08:04:16.788 --> 08:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
something else by the age of 16. tough
 
08:04:19.430 --> 08:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I support this bill you've
 
08:04:21.110 --> 08:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
got 16 you've got by 16 you've got
 
08:04:23.150 --> 08:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to instruct your kids in
 
08:04:24.530 --> 08:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
the way of the world and if you haven't
 
08:04:27.110 --> 08:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
done so by 16 then they have the right
 
08:04:29.090 --> 08:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
to go talk to other people so that's how
 
08:04:30.288 --> 08:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
I feel thank you
 
08:04:34.128 --> 08:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay uh representative
 
08:04:36.770 --> 08:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
actually representative
 
08:04:40.968 --> 08:04:40.978 align:start position:0%
question so if you if if the closest
 
08:04:44.090 --> 08:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
psychologist is a psychologist in your
 
08:04:47.510 --> 08:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
public school isn't he or she is paid by
 
08:04:47.520 --> 08:04:50.150 align:start position:0%
public school isn't he or she is paid by
government

08:04:50.150 --> 08:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:51.888 --> 08:04:51.898 align:start position:0%
actually yes if it's school psychologist
 
08:04:55.430 --> 08:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
it would be ah thank you
 
08:04:58.310 --> 08:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Freitas yes thank you
 
08:05:00.468 --> 08:05:00.478 align:start position:0%
um I got a master's degree and our
 
08:05:03.650 --> 08:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
program was Kyle Rogers who was the Guru
 
08:05:07.190 --> 08:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
at the time in non-directive counseling
 
08:05:10.730 --> 08:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
and I feel like that Seth King has just
 
08:05:13.190 --> 08:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
said these young people need someone to
 
08:05:16.190 --> 08:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
talk to and the object behind this
 
08:05:18.888 --> 08:05:18.898 align:start position:0%
program was that you visited with them
 
08:05:19.968 --> 08:05:19.978 align:start position:0%
and talked with them into the house
 
08:05:21.650 --> 08:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
things going in you got a conversation
 
08:05:24.110 --> 08:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
started and you went from there so that
 
08:05:26.628 --> 08:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
that's how it began with no Direction
 
08:05:30.530 --> 08:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
just to a meeting and a thing but it was
 
08:05:33.170 --> 08:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
interesting that seems like it's new to
 
08:05:35.868 --> 08:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
the people at the table today
 
08:05:39.770 --> 08:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh yes yes your
 
08:05:41.330 --> 08:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
friend from Nashville my friend from
 
08:05:44.690 --> 08:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
Nashville um this a similar Bill to this
 
08:05:47.388 --> 08:05:47.398 align:start position:0%
came up a couple years ago but the age
 
08:05:51.888 --> 08:05:51.898 align:start position:0%
on it was 12 which made me bristle and
 
08:05:54.170 --> 08:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
although it was cited that you could be
 
08:05:58.128 --> 08:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
treated for STDs at 12. I
 
08:06:00.350 --> 08:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
14. okay
 
08:06:03.650 --> 08:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
anyway so um I am I couldn't imagine
 
08:06:05.330 --> 08:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
taking a 12 year old client without
 
08:06:08.628 --> 08:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
their parents knowing or 13 year old or
 
08:06:10.610 --> 08:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
maybe even a 14 year old but I'm
 
08:06:12.650 --> 08:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a 16 year old I mean
 
08:06:15.468 --> 08:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
people can quit school at that age the
 
08:06:19.208 --> 08:06:19.218 align:start position:0%
old no not anymore not anymore nope boy
 
08:06:21.730 --> 08:06:21.740 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable
 
08:06:25.730 --> 08:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
I am comfortable with the age of 16 of
 
08:06:29.090 --> 08:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
course you can get married with court
 
08:06:30.888 --> 08:06:30.898 align:start position:0%
permission with the Court's permission
 
08:06:32.448 --> 08:06:32.458 align:start position:0%
at 16.
 
08:06:33.948 --> 08:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
08:06:36.830 --> 08:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes children need someone to talk to and
 
08:06:40.190 --> 08:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
if we operate from the premise that
 
08:06:42.948 --> 08:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
therapists are trained professionals
 
08:06:45.888 --> 08:06:45.898 align:start position:0%
that will behave in professional manner
 
08:06:47.628 --> 08:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good build to go
 
08:06:52.388 --> 08:06:52.398 align:start position:0%
forward thank you um and uh I was hoping
 
08:06:54.468 --> 08:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
 
08:06:54.478 --> 08:06:55.670 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
Cannon

08:06:55.670 --> 08:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
Cannon
 
08:06:57.468 --> 08:06:57.478 align:start position:0%
so um
 
08:07:00.410 --> 08:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
actually I had a conversation with the
 
08:07:03.530 --> 08:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that bill which was would
 
08:07:05.750 --> 08:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
reduce it to 12 and
 
08:07:09.590 --> 08:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
part of her concern was that she knows a
 
08:07:12.888 --> 08:07:12.898 align:start position:0%
lot of people who do not have parents in
 
08:07:14.888 --> 08:07:14.898 align:start position:0%
their life at all
 
08:07:17.388 --> 08:07:17.398 align:start position:0%
young people who are living on the
 
08:07:20.690 --> 08:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
street having a very hard time of it and
 
08:07:24.468 --> 08:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
need somebody to talk to so part of her
 
08:07:24.478 --> 08:07:25.190 align:start position:0%
need somebody to talk to so part of her
um

08:07:25.190 --> 08:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:29.270 --> 08:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
advocacy involved these talk therapy
 
08:07:29.280 --> 08:07:30.350 align:start position:0%
advocacy involved these talk therapy
um

08:07:30.350 --> 08:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:32.990 --> 08:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
talk therapy programs
 
08:07:34.910 --> 08:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
08:07:37.250 --> 08:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know I struggle with how do we
 
08:07:37.260 --> 08:07:39.170 align:start position:0%
you know I struggle with how do we
balance

08:07:39.170 --> 08:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
balance
 
08:07:41.930 --> 08:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
Meeting those needs how do we balance
 
08:07:44.990 --> 08:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
Meeting those people where they are with
 
08:07:48.048 --> 08:07:48.058 align:start position:0%
at the same time saying that you know
 
08:07:52.310 --> 08:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
parents parents have a uh have a right
 
08:07:54.830 --> 08:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be fully full participants in their
 
08:07:56.270 --> 08:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
children's lives
 
08:08:01.010 --> 08:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
up until 18. 16 is again I think we're
 
08:08:02.628 --> 08:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
we are getting into a kind of a gray
 
08:08:05.628 --> 08:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
area here my I I will fall on the side
 
08:08:07.490 --> 08:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the line that says
 
08:08:09.888 --> 08:08:09.898 align:start position:0%
a 16 year old is still a minor they're
 
08:08:11.990 --> 08:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
still living in their parents home and I
 
08:08:14.330 --> 08:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
will fall on the side of that argument
 
08:08:15.530 --> 08:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
that says
 
08:08:18.048 --> 08:08:18.058 align:start position:0%
you know parental rights Prevail under
 
08:08:20.150 --> 08:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
those circumstances so having having
 
08:08:23.750 --> 08:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
said that I I understand and and I
 
08:08:25.850 --> 08:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
certainly accept that a 16 year old is
 
08:08:28.010 --> 08:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
is more capable of making that decision
 
08:08:29.628 --> 08:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
than a 14 year old or certainly a 12
 
08:08:31.610 --> 08:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
year old and
 
08:08:31.620 --> 08:08:32.448 align:start position:0%
year old and
um

08:08:32.448 --> 08:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:08:34.850 --> 08:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
you know it's unfortunate that we can't
 
08:08:36.770 --> 08:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes we have to
 
08:08:38.990 --> 08:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
give in one area to solve a problem in
 
08:08:40.610 --> 08:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
another area and I'm not sure how we do
 
08:08:42.888 --> 08:08:42.898 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure how we help those
 
08:08:44.930 --> 08:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
those folks that that representative
 
08:08:46.368 --> 08:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
Klein Knight was
 
08:08:49.430 --> 08:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned about but uh I
 
08:08:52.968 --> 08:08:52.978 align:start position:0%
will be voting no or no on the on the
 
08:08:55.910 --> 08:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
OTP motion representative Cannon
 
08:08:57.770 --> 08:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
one list
 
08:09:00.888 --> 08:09:00.898 align:start position:0%
um this past fall in the summersworth
 
08:09:02.830 --> 08:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
school system we
 
08:09:06.548 --> 08:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
we passed a a bill to support
 
08:09:09.170 --> 08:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
transgender kids in in the high school
 
08:09:13.910 --> 08:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
but it required that their parents were
 
08:09:15.770 --> 08:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
working with them
 
08:09:15.780 --> 08:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
working with them
um

08:09:17.030 --> 08:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:09:19.548 --> 08:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
for them to go through through a
 
08:09:21.650 --> 08:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
transition process or whatever but they
 
08:09:23.810 --> 08:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
they had to have support from their
 
08:09:28.070 --> 08:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
parents but that left a number of kids
 
08:09:30.410 --> 08:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
who don't have support from their
 
08:09:33.770 --> 08:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:36.410 --> 08:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
um in the Lurch with what do they do
 
08:09:39.530 --> 08:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
there's no place and to have
 
08:09:42.830 --> 08:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill in place to have the ability
 
08:09:45.530 --> 08:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
for them to decide that they really want
 
08:09:48.110 --> 08:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to somebody that can help some
 
08:09:50.448 --> 08:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
of that process because they can't talk
 
08:09:52.850 --> 08:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
to their parents and they could talk to
 
08:09:54.650 --> 08:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
their teachers and a counselor but
 
08:09:57.170 --> 08:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the teacher or
 
08:09:59.990 --> 08:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the school counselor's job if the
 
08:10:02.330 --> 08:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
council the counselor's job may be to
 
08:10:04.548 --> 08:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
help find them someone whose life a
 
08:10:06.110 --> 08:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
licensed therapist that they can talk
 
08:10:09.110 --> 08:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
with this this bill would help do that
 
08:10:11.208 --> 08:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative Freitas yes
 
08:10:13.788 --> 08:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking
 
08:10:15.530 --> 08:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I just want to comment that the most
 
08:10:17.208 --> 08:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
of the elementary schools that I taught
 
08:10:19.788 --> 08:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
him had a counselor in the building so
 
08:10:21.230 --> 08:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
now you're talking eight-year-olds
 
08:10:23.150 --> 08:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
nine-year-olds going to the councilman
 
08:10:25.910 --> 08:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
school now was not a therapist counselor
 
08:10:29.510 --> 08:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
but it started the ball rolling so um I
 
08:10:31.368 --> 08:10:31.378 align:start position:0%
just want to defend that that can be
 
08:10:34.730 --> 08:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKay thank you
 
08:10:34.740 --> 08:10:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKay thank you
microphone

08:10:37.490 --> 08:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
08:10:40.788 --> 08:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
remember to push the button my
 
08:10:45.830 --> 08:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
reaction is the state involving itself
 
08:10:45.840 --> 08:10:47.448 align:start position:0%
reaction is the state involving itself
in

08:10:47.448 --> 08:10:47.458 align:start position:0%
in
 
08:10:48.850 --> 08:10:48.860 align:start position:0%
a a
 
08:10:52.850 --> 08:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
professional practice I don't see
 
08:10:56.208 --> 08:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
legislation telling doctors how to do
 
08:10:59.690 --> 08:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
surgery or how to do this that or the
 
08:11:02.750 --> 08:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
other thing that's what concerns me and
 
08:11:04.670 --> 08:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
that this opens the door
 
08:11:08.930 --> 08:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
for more legislation when I when I feel
 
08:11:12.530 --> 08:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
that after there are licensing boards
 
08:11:15.110 --> 08:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are very strict I used to sit on
 
08:11:15.120 --> 08:11:16.090 align:start position:0%
that are very strict I used to sit on
one

08:11:16.090 --> 08:11:16.100 align:start position:0%
one
 
08:11:18.350 --> 08:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're not doing the amendment just the
 
08:11:20.628 --> 08:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
bill underneath that allows kids that
 
08:11:23.330 --> 08:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
are 16 and older yeah mostly what I'm
 
08:11:26.948 --> 08:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
saying is that I dislike the the state
 
08:11:30.830 --> 08:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
involving itself in the mental health
 
08:11:32.990 --> 08:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
practice or any other professional
 
08:11:37.730 --> 08:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
practice and then that's where I get so
 
08:11:41.570 --> 08:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
upset by this because it opens a door so
 
08:11:45.430 --> 08:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's any part of it uh I don't like
 
08:11:48.948 --> 08:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think hopefully we're
 
08:11:50.448 --> 08:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
ready I think we're ready to call the
 
08:11:50.458 --> 08:11:51.170 align:start position:0%
ready I think we're ready to call the
roll

08:11:51.170 --> 08:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
roll
 
08:11:52.910 --> 08:11:52.920 align:start position:0%

Nutter upon volunteered to write a
 
08:13:46.788 --> 08:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
different one
 
08:13:49.250 --> 08:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
um on the lead Bill the lead Bill the
 
08:13:51.948 --> 08:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
lead Bill okay
 
08:13:54.468 --> 08:13:54.478 align:start position:0%
and you won't be doing an amendment
 
08:13:56.150 --> 08:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
because we just have to go yeah no
 
08:13:57.590 --> 08:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment because we passed the bill I
 
08:13:59.750 --> 08:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear it's late yes
 
08:14:02.208 --> 08:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
absolutely and representative would you
 
08:14:04.368 --> 08:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
write The Minority Report for us on that
 
08:14:05.930 --> 08:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:14:07.610 --> 08:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
08:14:10.610 --> 08:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I think we've we have gone through 12
 
08:14:12.650 --> 08:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
bills I would call this a resounding
 
08:14:14.570 --> 08:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
success since it was approximately a
 
08:14:16.070 --> 08:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
half day
 
08:14:18.830 --> 08:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
um so we will we will continue all of
 
08:14:21.708 --> 08:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
these executive sessions to Wednesday at
 
08:14:23.690 --> 08:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
9 00 a.m on the 15th it'll be noticed in
 
08:14:25.430 --> 08:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
the calendar is there representative
 
08:14:25.440 --> 08:14:26.570 align:start position:0%
the calendar is there representative
Weber

08:14:26.570 --> 08:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
08:14:29.628 --> 08:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
question would be are we also going to
 
08:14:32.990 --> 08:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
have a potential session on Thursday if
 
08:14:42.110 --> 08:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:44.690 --> 08:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
sincerely hope that we would get through
 
08:14:46.430 --> 08:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
16 bills
 
08:14:46.440 --> 08:14:48.530 align:start position:0%
16 bills
however

08:14:48.530 --> 08:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
however
 
08:14:51.350 --> 08:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the best will in the world
 
08:14:55.490 --> 08:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have taken breaks we have talked and
 
08:14:58.910 --> 08:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's all very productive
 
08:15:00.830 --> 08:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
08:15:03.770 --> 08:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about truncating things
 
08:15:07.730 --> 08:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
and my hope would be that we could get a
 
08:15:09.770 --> 08:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
room on the Thursday because we don't
 
08:15:12.350 --> 08:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
have a session day
 
08:15:15.468 --> 08:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
and we could notice on Thursday a
 
08:15:18.650 --> 08:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
continued hearing from Wednesday if
 
08:15:23.150 --> 08:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
necessary hope that we don't need it but
 
08:15:26.628 --> 08:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
have it in case of need
 
08:15:28.368 --> 08:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
wait wait we can do that I think I think
 
08:15:29.810 --> 08:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
we've been asked not to do that but we
 
08:15:31.610 --> 08:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
will we will try and do that so I mean
 
08:15:34.250 --> 08:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm well it's just a suggestion but
 
08:15:36.410 --> 08:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
if we can we can't I will I will see
 
08:15:38.090 --> 08:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
what we can do to secure a room in order
 
08:15:40.670 --> 08:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
to overflow if necessary but if we all
 
08:15:43.548 --> 08:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
we all come ready to uh ready to accept
 
08:15:45.288 --> 08:15:45.298 align:start position:0%
that some of these bills are going to be
 
08:15:48.590 --> 08:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
divided and maybe Madam chairman yes is
 
08:15:50.090 --> 08:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
there is it possible to I don't know if
 
08:15:51.590 --> 08:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is appropriate can we start earlier
 
08:15:53.810 --> 08:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's scheduled on the notice I just got
 
08:15:59.650 --> 08:15:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:01.670 --> 08:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
is there any reason we couldn't start
 
08:16:01.680 --> 08:16:03.530 align:start position:0%
is there any reason we couldn't start
earlier

08:16:03.530 --> 08:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
08:16:06.770 --> 08:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
remember that some of us drive a very
 
08:16:09.888 --> 08:16:09.898 align:start position:0%
long way I do as well yeah just thinking
 
08:16:11.570 --> 08:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
that if you start half an hour early and
 
08:16:14.030 --> 08:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
just intend to get through it all I mean
 
08:16:17.448 --> 08:16:17.458 align:start position:0%
were you proposing 8 30 yes
 
08:16:19.788 --> 08:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:16:22.430 --> 08:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
um to avoid Thursday
 
08:16:25.968 --> 08:16:25.978 align:start position:0%
is there are there problems
 
08:16:28.610 --> 08:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
I already get up at four o'clock in the
 
08:16:30.708 --> 08:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
morning to be here at nine so okay then
 
08:16:32.690 --> 08:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
I think I think probably nine and that's
 
08:16:34.430 --> 08:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
just coming through with serious
 
08:16:36.410 --> 08:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
intentions to get this done
 
08:16:37.850 --> 08:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
so we will move it to nine o'clock
 
08:16:40.128 --> 08:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
instead of nine thirty um it should have
 
08:16:48.590 --> 08:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:48.600 --> 08:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
