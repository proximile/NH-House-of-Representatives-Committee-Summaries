this is a uh non-gain amendment to House
 
00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.469 align:start position:0%
this is a uh non-gain amendment to House
Bill

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
1015 um but I'd like to begin with the
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
same quote I began um uh my bill last
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
year with uh as Frederick Douglas said
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
once you learn to read you will be free
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
forever um and and I'd like to thank
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
representative ball for her um interest
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
and um experience and passion in
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
promoting literacy in New Hampshire and
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh introducing
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
1015 um I I think this uh Amendment um
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
is necessary uh because if New Hampshire
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
is really going to improve student
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
reading we need a comprehensive
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
approach it starts with the early
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
screening then the intervention when
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
necessary but we need parental
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
involvement we need monitoring we need
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
accountability we have to make sure that
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
current teachers are coming up to speed
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the evidence-based instructional
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
methods and also very importantly the
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
teacher prog teacher prep programs have
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
to be on board with this um new um
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
instructional method so where do we
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
stand today
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
2023 proficiency level the state average
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh for ELA was
 
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
uh for ELA was
52%

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
52%
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
52% uh my district Regional Cooperative
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
School District with to EXs swep
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
towns the ELA uh proficiency rate was
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
51% below the state
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
average uh two of the towns Effingham
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
Elementary School reading proficiency is
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
60% but funny when they get to
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
elementary school excuse me the Regional
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
44% so something is going on and and
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections are
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
needed um what I'd like to do is just go
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
through the amendment uh section by
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
section U briefly if I could um and it
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
starts on page
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
one with uh the uh reading assessment
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
and intervention section um aligns 10
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
down through the bottom of the page
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
really and
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
um again there would be a screener uh
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
purchased by the department a
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh screening for uh uh
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
reading and
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and all the risk factors
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
therein and has to be done three times a
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
year um according to um really all the
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
uh the experts and you'll see listed on
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 25 the um predictive
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
measures that would be screened for um
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
which in based on the um evidencebased
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
research that's been done over decades
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
that is uh referred to as the science of
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
reading um
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
this would start the screening would
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
start 40 days into the school year and
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
three times a year as I mentioned U but
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
also as you see it continued on page two
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
for anyone coming into the school
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
transferring into the school who hasn't
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
been um through the screening would have
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
to be screened so if someone's moving
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
into the district um we would want them
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
screened as well
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
um in Roman
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
3 um if there is an apparent uh
 
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
3 um if there is an apparent uh
deficiency

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
and um documenting the uh deficiency is
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
required in an individual reading plan
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
and um the department is to come up with
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
a form um for that um and we've had U
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
actually um a national expert uh
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer to help help with that
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
effort um down starting on lines
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
23 we want to make sure that we're
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward we're not maintaining the
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
status quo so this three queing method
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
of um reading that is being used widely
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um at this point um which includes
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
visual um cues that that is not being
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
used in any of the instructional or
 
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.230 align:start position:0%
used in any of the instructional or
Interventional

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
Interventional
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
programs um also the fact that uh
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
parents have to be involved in this
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on the bottom part of
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
the page in that um strategies have to
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
be given to the parents to how they can
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
help with the the deficiencies in their
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
child's reading and they first of all
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
they must be notified that there is an
 
00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.030 align:start position:0%
they must be notified that there is an
issue

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
um it's critical
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
that parents are involved in this
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
process over to page
 
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
process over to page
three

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
um one difference
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
um in um this amendment from
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
10:15 um I I don't lay out any many any
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
mandatory time frames for referrals uh
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
for special
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
education um I'm just um concerned that
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
um there would be um a slew of uh
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
referrals possibly and uh I wouldn't
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
want to see overidentification of
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
students as requiring special education
 
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
students as requiring special education
either

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
um the rest of the page really um
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
outlines um many
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the department um in
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
this effort um already mentioned the
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
fact that they will have to find the
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
funds to purchase um this Universal
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
screener but as you'll see starting in
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
Romans 7 um they have to provide
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
periodic workshops to Educators and
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
parents on this instructional reading
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
method they have to provide guidance to
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
the districts on instructional materials
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
that um are based on this evidence
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's been gathered over the past
 
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.150 align:start position:0%
that's been gathered over the past
several

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
decades they have to do reporting
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the department
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
um as well as the school districts and
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
charter schools have to do reporting uh
 
00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
charter schools have to do reporting uh
as

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
well and the Department's reporting has
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
to be given to the governor's office
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
including I think it's important that
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
the governor's office see uh what's
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
going on and what progress hopefully is
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
being made in
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
this the bottom of the page gets into
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
the teacher prep program which is um
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and it lays out the requirement to do
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
a survey of the teacher prep
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
programs um with
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
criteria that were was developed by the
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh national teacher quality Council n
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
tcq um they did uh two years of work
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
work coming up with these criteria and
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
they surveyed um uh teacher prep
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
programs around the
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
country um to see if they were meeting
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the uh criteria that uh the NT CQ
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
came up with um I'll just mention um the
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
four New Hampshire colleges that
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
submitted um their um results um to the
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh to the council
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh Keen State got a B Plymouth State got
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
a D Southern New Hampshire University
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
got an F you and H got a
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
D so
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done in the teacher
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
prep programs if any progress is going
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
sustained uh for our children in in
 
00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
sustained uh for our children in in

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
literacy the next section um of the uh
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment um starting on line nine on
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
page three um are reading Improvement
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
Grants um these would be grants to um
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
districts or elementary schools that are
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
in the uh below the state average in
 
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.829 align:start position:0%

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
um I I've talked with the chair of
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.389 align:start position:0%
um I I've talked with the chair of
Finance

00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
um about um appropriation for these um
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
grants and um um we he says that uh if
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
the bill comes to finance they'll work
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
on finding the
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
funding um and the department would be
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
involved in looking at plans submitted
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
by the districts in terms of how the
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
funds would be used uh to um improve um
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
literacy in their
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
schools uh the next section on the
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page um modifies current
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
Statute in terms of literac literacy
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
School skill
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
development and includes the fact that
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
we want to move to this uh
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based instructional methods and
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
outlines um at the bottom five or six
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
sentences of this page um the components
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
of reading literacy that we'll be um
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
interested in and um you can see that um
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
I've borrowed from the original 1015 and
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
added writing um in there as well as all
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
the other components
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
section so those are really the the key
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
components of this um
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and I I think that it it
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
really identifies a um comprehensive
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
approach um I've worked with uh people
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
around the State national experts um as
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
well as the department and and I see uh
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
director white here um but um it's I I
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
even sat in on a professional
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
development uh session um in London
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
Derry this summer um with teachers um
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
going over uh presenter talking about
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
moving to um the science of reading and
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
um uh it was uh very interesting uh
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
being the only non- educator um in the
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
room um but
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh they are all interested in in doing
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
this um some of the schools were already
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
doing it um many weren't and so um uh
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
there is the interest in doing it and I
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
think that what I've tried to lay out
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
here also will help
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
teachers um and Educators in moving uh
 
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.549 align:start position:0%
teachers um and Educators in moving uh
to

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
evidence based uh research and
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
instruction um and we we've talked in
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the past about some of the research um
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.070 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about
uh

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the reading brain
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the detailed efforts to even
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
identify um parts of the brain and what
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
happens um when students are learning to
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
read and the difference with dyslexia
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
also when student has
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
dyslexia um how it works differently in
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
the brain so we want to take advantage
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
of this research we know that um we know
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
that it work works from results around
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
the state excuse me around the nation
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
there's something like 30 states in the
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
past 3 or 4 years that have moved to
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
this evidence-based instruction and I
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
think it's uh time for New Hampshire um
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
to move in that direction and I thank
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much are there any
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli oh sorry just represent restive
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't know with an amendment
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
usually you don't get a fiscal note but
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is such a rework of the whole 1015
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if there's and it seems
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
like the local um Lea is going to uh
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
have to expend a lot of money as well
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
money and time so um I was wondering if
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
if there is a fiscal note or would there
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal Note coming and shouldn't it
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
include local
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
um uh if it is passed out of the house
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
it'll go to finance so um they will be
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
examining this um uh in depth I'm sure
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I as I mentioned I've already talked
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the chairman of Finance about
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
it usually we get a fiscal note here
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
though well yeah I'm not sure if um we
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
get a fiscal note with all uh
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
amendments um and um I can't remember
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
the bill last year if that had a fiscal
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
note or not attached to it um but this
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
is different in terms of of um I think
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
the grants uh section is different
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
because we're in the middle of a budget
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
season um I approached these as uh
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
competitive grants um instead of I think
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
what I had tried to lay out last year um
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit different in that
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
regard because it's the middle of the
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
budget we have a follow follow yes so is
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education um will they
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
be hiring extra staff or a reading
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
specialist um they have someone already
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
on board um serving that function and
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
they won't be hiring additional staff I
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not going to speak for the
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
Department uh in that regard but um
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
maybe Miss uh director white can uh
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions in that thank you
 
00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:46.669 align:start position:0%
answer any questions in that thank you
well

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
vain any further question oh yes
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you very much
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um throughout
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the um the amendment and and um and and
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
actually in the the I I don't have it in
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
front of me but I think the um the the
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Baseline Bill also refers to grade level
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
predictive measures and I was wondering
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
if you could talk with us a little bit
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
determined um I I think maybe some
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
people behind me can speak to that um
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
more accurately than I
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
can okay thank
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
bbon thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um just a
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
couple of things is this um this is
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
identical to the bill that we looked at
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
last fall um I don't think it's
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
identical the amendment the amendment
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
right well I have it's pretty
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
close so what's different
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
then um I'm not sure I've been working
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
on this for a long time so I'm not sure
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
exactly I haven't done it side by side
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
with the bill from last year I know the
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
reading um Grant section I believe is
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
different and some other sections I've
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh updated based on uh comments from
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
last year and even looking at the
 
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.750 align:start position:0%
last year and even looking at the
original

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
1015 um follow yes followup um just well
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually it's kind of a different
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry um you made the
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
comment that they are all interested in
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
doing this and I'm just curious
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
who well um for one um many of the
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
people um uh attending that um
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
professional development uh session that
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
I went to um the room was uh uh full uh
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that showed the interest um
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh from schools um uh as I recall
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
schools around the state were
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
represented there and I'm sorry I'm just
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
trying to determine that the what you
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
went to was something that was um put on
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
by the London da School District or was
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
it it was um it was a professional
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
development uh um session I think um put
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
on by the department if I am not
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
mistaken um with a presenter from um
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all I'm trying to get is
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
is the scope representative bone follow
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
it yes please u i I'm just trying to
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
understand better the scope of the
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
attendance that was at that
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
event um I I did not have an attendance
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
list but I I talked to quite a few
 
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.070 align:start position:0%
list but I I talked to quite a few
people

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
there um I've been to various sessions
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
I've been to um there was a session um
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh I guess um this summer sometime um uh
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
with uh people who have been to the uh
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
letters training that the department is
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
paying for with over um 3,000 people
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
around the state Educators and parents
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh being trained in um in the letters
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
program which is training on uh this uh
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh instructional methods
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and it was uh actually disappointing
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh for me to learn that I think it was
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
only maybe five teachers from our
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
Regional School District um had been
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
training representative Hall you madam
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative would you agree
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
that because teachers attend these p
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
sessions they don't necessarily buy into
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
what's being presented they they go
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to go or they
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
go because they need PD hours but it's
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
not that you don't assume that they are
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
buy I I I I'm not making that assumption
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
I just the people I talked to were quite
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
interested thank you representative
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you this is kind of a
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
procedural question I don't um so your
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh or the original bill
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill to this one was laid on
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
the table um in in session right is that
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
what happened at
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
10:15 10:15 yeah no we haven't
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
um uh we haven't voted on that in the
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
Full House as I Rec it was your original
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
Bill the one that is almost the same was
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
tabled last year was tabled in the house
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
session yes so how was that able to be

back because was
 
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:31.789 align:start position:0%
back because was

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
taken off the table at the
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
house representative Luna thank you very
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair um on um on page two of
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment in section three and then
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
later in section four um section three
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
on line seven talks about an individual
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
reading plan and section four on line 35
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
talks about a reading Improvement plan
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
are those the same thing or can you sort
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
of explain what the what the difference
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
is here I I I believe they're basically
 
00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:08.310 align:start position:0%
is here I I I believe they're basically
the

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
same thank
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
ball good morning thank you for allowing
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
me to speak today um and also thank you
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for all the hard
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
work that you put toward this amendment
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
in full disclosure I should say I
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
believe I am a sponsor on the original
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh bill that that representative
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli put
 
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
cordelli put
forward

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how to say this without
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
being uh wrong here but I am
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed that this um amendment was
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
put onto my bill um that I wrote the
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
reason being is that the bill that I
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
presented if you look at the original um
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
RSA it's this long it's one
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph and my intent when I read this
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
as I stated in my testimony last week
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
when I read that section it immediately
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
red flagged me that this was special
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
education wording it came from that
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
going back to that deliberation form I
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
shared last week that's where this came
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
from and my intent was to make this more
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
informational so people understand
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what the components are of
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
literacy and if you notice they include
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
math math and writing which I don't see
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
importantly the purpose and the re
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
reason for my writing um 1015 was to
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
Define literacy expectations in New
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to reflect the federal
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines and expectation used in
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
identifying children with a specific uh
 
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
identifying children with a specific uh
learning

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
disability and to establish limited
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
timeline for providing RTI prior to
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
ruling out A literacy disability or
 
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.950 align:start position:0%
ruling out A literacy disability or
learning

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
disability I believe that my bill
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
presented an effective way to establish
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
just enough guidance to allow schools to
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
look more critically at their literacy
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
programs um that they may be considering
 
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.710 align:start position:0%
programs um that they may be considering
to

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
purchase while still allowing them to
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
have enough local control to choose
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
which program works best for their
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
district and their
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
students my concern with the bill now
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and all of these um
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
requirements being put
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
forward is that school districts have
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
already started purchasing programs I
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
know that in Salem they are already
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
piloting the Wilson Foundation program
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
in grades one and
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
two I know that because those are the
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
grades my grandchildren are
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
in I've also been informed by
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
constituents that Rochester Plymouth and
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
Kean have already moved in the direction
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of the old fest and panel
 
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.669 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of the old fest and panel
members

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
type method and moving into the phonics
 
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.789 align:start position:0%
type method and moving into the phonics
based

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
instruction I was also told by a teacher
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
last year in nasua they literally threw
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
away the teachers were told to take all
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
the font panel materials and put them in
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
the dumpster so they have already moved
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
away and are moving toward the science
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
of reading or the phonics based
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
instruction my concern is that if we
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
start making more stipulations and the
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
programs and districts have already
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
started buying programs
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
RS that we could have a conflict and
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's really important
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
to set our expectations right away and
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
not bog down the bill with all this
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
extra stuff we can always come back I
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
think the the idea of certifying
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
teachers and making sure teachers um the
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
students who are being certified as
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
teachers coming out of our colleges I
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
definitely agree they need more training
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
but I think that should be a standalone
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and not associated with what our
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
expectations are for the definition of
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
literacy um I was
 
00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:33.549 align:start position:0%
literacy um I was
also

00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I again I I go back and I
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
say I I really commend representative
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
cordelli but even as a co-sponsor on the
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
bill I had mentioned to him I had
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
concerns um for one thing we already
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
passed a screening Bill last year so
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
that's already being
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
implemented the other thing is that when
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
we talk about screening in in his bill
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
there's no mention of ruling out vision
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
and hearing and dyslexia is a hearing
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
disability because children don't always
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
here they can't hear the
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
articulation um so that worries
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
me the other thing that I had brought
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
forward to him and I don't see that had
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
been changed is that the deficiency are
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
below age appropriate benchmarks but
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
when we identify children or we evaluate
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
them for special education as I showed
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
you the Wyatt last week the welshire
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
individual um the achievement tests that
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
we use academic um achievement test we
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
always use grade level
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
Norms we have to because age means
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
nothing I mentioned my two
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
granddaughters my granddaughter who's in
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
first grade is six she's the youngest in
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
her class while my granddaughter who's
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
in second grade is eight she's the
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
oldest in her class there's a two-year
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
difference in their in their ages but
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're only one year apart in school we
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
can't go by ages because that doesn't
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
tell us what skills we should expect
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
that they have been taught in their
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
grades so I believe that that needs to
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
say grade level
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
expectations or grade appropriate
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
benchmarks because then we would know
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
what they've actually been taught and
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
what we could expect them to
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
know um a few other
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
things that I was jotting down
 
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.909 align:start position:0%
things that I was jotting down
is

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um screening children when they come
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
into a district I think that's a
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea but why stop at third
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
grade I even go back to the testimony
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
last week saying that they should all
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
end at third grade that doesn't make
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
sense because phonics continues we're
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
still learning phonics in fifth grade it
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
what's included in phonics when we're
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
teaching um vocabulary we need to be
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
teaching root words Greek and Latin root
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
words if we don't teach them then how do
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
we teach teach children when to use a pH
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
for f sound versus an F Well we have to
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
teach them it's a Greek based word uses
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
a pH if we leave that out we're leaving
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
out we're making a gap where they don't
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand so now they're just going to
 
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.829 align:start position:0%
understand so now they're just going to
memorize

00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
memorize
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
again phonics continues it's a lifelong
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
lesson we continue to dissect and
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
investigate and if we present it
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
correctly to our students it should be
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
fun it's a puzzle it's uncovering a
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
puzzle on how literacy works and
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
literacy doesn't just end it phonics it
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
includes vocabulary if we don't have
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
vocabulary we don't have comprehension
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why phonics going back to
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
that whole decoding is so important
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
because if children keep stumbling over
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
words they don't get fluency without
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
fluency they you know you fluency I'm
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
not really I should take that back
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
because fluency you should only read as
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
fast as it as you can comprehend
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're just reading words but
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
you need to integrate that into your um
 
00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:58.870 align:start position:0%
you need to integrate that into your um
background

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge but we can't have
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
comprehension if we're still trying to
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
decode so this this continues and it
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't surprise me to hear that in
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's uh District
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
that the reading proficiency levels
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
dropped in middle school that goes right
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
back to what I said in middle school is
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
when we find out when the reading
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities are there because we have
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
multi- slabic words and yet no way for
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
children to actually they don't have the
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
skills to decode those words so they're
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
reading level drops and that's why we're
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
identifying children in Middle
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
School um there were a few
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
items when I was going over the bill and
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
I don't really think I need to go into
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
every one of them I would really love to
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
work more with representative cordelli I
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
just don't think this portion is ready
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
for prime time yet I think it could end
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
up H um hindering the possibility that
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
we could pass what I put forward I am
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
more than willing to to amend if I can
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
or have somebody work with someone here
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
to amend mine to include the charter
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
schools that was talked about or even
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
take off section two if it's needed the
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
whole thing on the RTI and we do that as
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
a standalone but right now I think the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
most important thing is to provide the
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
guidance to the school as to what
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
exactly we expect literacy education to
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
look like in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that includes encoding decoding
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
grammar mechanics writing mathematics
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's all part of literacy
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you do we have any
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative ball
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative belter thank you madam
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
question uh the one thing I wanted to
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
get a little bit deeper in is you
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that schools were already
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
starting to purchase um new reading
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
materials and whatnot do you have any
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
specific examples or or or programs that
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know of that are being purchased
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
that would not qualify under this um
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
this sort of rubric of evidence-based um
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
science reading well you have to keep in
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
mind that phonic is a standalone you
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
still have to have a comprehension a
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
reading program that includes
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
comprehension um and also we have a
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
writing component the other I keep
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
mentioning fontis and panel but Lucy
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
ckins is the writing program that has
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
also been debunked so that also needs to
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
be replaced um in many of the schools so
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond just the phonics I don't
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
know exactly I just know that in Salem I
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
know that they're using the the Wilson
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
Foundation programs for phonics in the
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
first and second grade I know they're
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
piloting it
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
um most good I haven't looked at every
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
single one of them but good reading
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
programs or phonics programs would
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
include these components but my concern
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
is that what's not included here is the
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
writing and the mathematics we're just
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
focused on Phonics and we haven't we're
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
kind of leaving out the other portion um
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
of literacy which includes math and
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.630 align:start position:0%
of literacy which includes math and
writing

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
house

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair temporary chair
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
good morning yes and uh my name is
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
Deborah H I'm president of the American
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
I am here today to speak in opposition
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the non-gain amendment and uh
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
actually of HB 1015 as well
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to state that you know on
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of my members we are actually in
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
support of the goal of the bill and and
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
the Amendment but I do not think that
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
either is necessary at this point and uh
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
some of the timelines involved could get
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
in the way of delivering the help that
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
students need to become strong confident
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
readers um we have 3700 members cross
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
state most of them work in K12 education
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
many of them are directly involved in
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
teaching students to read every day and
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
that is my background I worked 18 years
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh teaching students to read in NASA um
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a parent of two
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
um adults now who took very different
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
Journeys on uh learning to read one
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
learned very easily and one struggled
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
with it mightily so I know this
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
personally as well as a professional um
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
my first concern with this is are either
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
of these bills necessary at this point
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
just last year this legislature approved
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
a uh law
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 259 that um change the universal
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
screening for dyslexia so every student
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten through third grade will
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
get screened with an evidence-based
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
reading screener that has many if not
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
all of the components that were outlined
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the non gerain amendment that we saw
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
today um administered twice a
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
year and uh you know you will see the
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
results from that and teachers need time
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
to look at those results and um that law
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
requires that schools take action upon
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
those results so that is what is in that
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
law that you just passed last year that
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
took effect September first this year uh
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh this 2023 sorry this school year uh
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
so when you see those results and you
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
see a student is below grade level on
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
one of those benchmarks of the component
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
skills of reading you need to do
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
something you need to decide whether
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
they need you know a little extra
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
practice in the classroom uh separate
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
intervention lessons um or whether it's
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
you know solo it's an immediate referral
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
to uh special education evaluation um
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
without giving that law a chance to work
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
it hasn't even had a full school year
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
yet you can't see if it's having any
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
results so piling either of these on top
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
of it would
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
be doing too much too
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
soon and um inviting
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
confusion and getting in the way of
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
helping students another concern is the
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
timelines in these bills both the uh HB
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
1015 has a timeline for special
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
education that that can interfere with
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
special education referrals and um the
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
non-main amendment has a very short
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
timeline for intervention
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
plans when you do the diagnostic
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
screening which was described in the um
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the nerain amendment you need time to
 
00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
look at it because it does not tell you
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
once you see that student is below gr
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
grade level it doesn't tell you what you
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
then go and do it just tells you this
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
student isn't performing well enough in
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
this component skill say it's phonics it
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you where to start you
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to waste that student's Time
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
by going back and teaching them that
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
this is the layer C this is the shape it
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
has this is the sound it makes if they
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
know the letter c already you need to
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
know which letter sounds you know which
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
letter shapes do they know which letter
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
s they know is it long vowels short
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
vowels where is it you start with that
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
student now imagine you have just
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
screened your whole class cuz you tend
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
to do the screeners all at the same time
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to lose a lot of
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
instructional time to do doing these
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
Benchmark screening you want to be
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
efficient so say of your class of 18 to
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
22 which is an average Elementary School
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
class it's not really one teacher to 12
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
students or 14 students um that's that's
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
a statistic that counts all the adults
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
with a teaching certificate in the grade
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the building not all
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
the adults actually in front of a class
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so say in your class of 18 to 22
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
students you've got six of them and now
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
you've got six school days to figure out
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
the reading intervention plan based on
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
what part of the Benchmark there below
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
grade level on that's not workable that
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
would be forcing teachers to come up
 
00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:20.670 align:start position:0%
would be forcing teachers to come up
with

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
plans without having the chance to sit
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
and use their professional skills to
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually analyze what the student needs
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
and if it's not one of the really
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
obvious ones like phonics where you've
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
got a lot of background in working in it
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
you might need to consult with the
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
reading Specialist or cons consult with
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
a special education teacher to figure
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
out okay this student student scored low
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
here where do I
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
start and that's professional
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
collaboration that goes on every day in
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
schools when you've got a kid where
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
you're not quite sure what to do with
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
them and then you know for if so you do
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
need to group them together somehow so
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
that you're teaching lessons that mean
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
something to the student and help them
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
with what they need to work on but also
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
makes use of the time because there's
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
only so many hours in the day so we
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to be so strict in our
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
timelines and
 
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.190 align:start position:0%
timelines and
so

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
um um um dictatorial in what we're
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing that it gets in the way of
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually helping students and the third
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
thing is we're um having having the
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
Education choose the screener and
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
possibly through these Innovation
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
grants choose the programs and and uh
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum I mean it's a carrot if
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
you're giving money but it also gives
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
them a lot of say in what you choose we
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
have districts already making choices
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
about what they want to use for reading
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
programs that should be a local control
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
issue but for these reasons we do have
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
concerns particularly about the non
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment but also about you know
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
is HB 1015 needed at this time let's see
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
how last year's newly pass RSA 259 works
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
out and we we are all working hard to
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
help our students we need to trust the
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
professionals these are at this time
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you thank
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
Terry uh so you the third person to
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
testify and I'm I'm trying to put all
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
the pieces together here and as I do so
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
and particularly with respect to your
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I I seem to be hearing that
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
you are saying what I'm hearing is that
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that we're already
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
beginning to address and to
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
fix uh problems in this
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
area and so we don't really need or
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
desire prescriptive
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to Define what it is that we
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
should be doing because we're already
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of what is being
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
proposed so if that's the case would you
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
either verify or correct
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
that misunderstanding if it's a
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding or or verify if I'm
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
correct and if it is correct would could
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
you explain what has driven in your view
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
what has driven a kind of Awakening if
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
you will that there needs to be a change
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
and why the changes that are being made
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
right now that you're describing are
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat in line with what we're
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
actually seeing in the bill and the
 
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
actually seeing in the bill and the
amendment

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
thanks uh you there is concern about
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
reading proficiency and reading
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
achievement um and there have been
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
numerous attempts to address performance
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
in that area some of them came together
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
sooner than
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
others I I think part of it is timing
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
this as you heard was also a bill last
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
year most of it um and didn't make it um
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
so you see some of that is still being
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
carried over um I I don't
 
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
carried over um I I don't
think

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing similar
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
things one year after another is going
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
to result in better change it's just
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to result in more churn and that's
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
learn oh follow
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
up so what was I correct when I stated
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that I thought that what I was
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from you is that we really don't
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
need either of these because the there's
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
a dynamic that is at work already within
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
the education Community to make the
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of changes that are being
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the bill Andor the
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
amendment in part or in there is a
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
dynamic out there that why is that
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
happening why is that happening and why
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
long you know that Dynamic is out there
 
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:16.589 align:start position:0%
long you know that Dynamic is out there
from

00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
just you the
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
um you know internal process
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
of frequently
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
examining um Statewide assessment scores
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
and benchmark scores and looking to see
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
differently it is a long process to
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
change within districts but um you it is
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
something that we examine on a district
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
level all the time and there is a
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
growing um Statewide pressure as well so
 
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.510 align:start position:0%
growing um Statewide pressure as well so
it

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.030 align:start position:0%
it
yep

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative belter thank you madam
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
question um you you referenced the uh
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
the bill we passed last year regarding
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
the dyslexia screener yeah and um makes
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
perfect sense that we would identify
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
it's good that we would identify such
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
students as needing help this bill seems
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
like so it has part of that part of
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's here but it also goes to the
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
other side of it which is once you've
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
identified a student that that has a
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
problem how do you address address that
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
student which is I think a significant
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
amount of what this is speaking to so do
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
you do you think that
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
um that what's happening right now in
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
school's absent us passing this bill
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
would already generally meet the
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
criteria of of addressing it with with
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
better techniques than have it been
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
previously used that has resulted in
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
problems uh the bill passed last year
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
does require that you act
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
upon the um The Benchmark testing so
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
that you don't just say oh well the
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
students Lo will grow out of it that is
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
not an accept acceptable action under
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed last year you
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
have to um you take some action whether
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
it is additional support in the
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
classroom whether there is some kind of
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
specific intervention and I I would have
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
to look again I was reading it yesterday
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
um but I was also reading the non-
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment and um but specific I
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
believe it was not evidence-based
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
intervention and or it could be a
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
referral to special ed so there were
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
different Pathways you could take um but
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
it did require action as opposed to just
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
a wait and see um approach so it wasn't
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
well you know we could wait and see
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
whether they get better at the next
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
expect for that is not an acceptable
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
approach to helping students learn you
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
do need to take an affirmative action to
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh try and remedy the
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
situation you it's not as detailed as
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
you have six days to write a plan but
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
then again six days to write a plan is
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
not realistic if you want a thoughtful
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
plan as supposed togg just well I will
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
follow the letter of the law but you're
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
going to force me to have a canned plan
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
for every student that would not be
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it wouldn't really
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
help students learn it would just be
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
hoops any further questions
 
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.630 align:start position:0%
hoops any further questions
representative

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss H um um I think
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony uh earlier when the
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
amendment was introduced that um that
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
and I um I I want to make sure I
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
characterize it right so please correct
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
me if WR you said uh
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
52% of students are State Statewide
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide so the my my question um sort
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
of has two parts to it um do some
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
districts exceed that Statewide average
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
and in those cases is what what what
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
what are you attributing to sorry excuse
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
me well obviously with an average some
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
districts would be exceeding that and
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
the districts that exceed it are the
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
ones that have better resources are able
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
to have lower class sizes fewer students
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
to teacher ratio um more learning
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
supports in place whether that is uh
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
highly trained par professionals who are
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
by the way are like assigned to one
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
classroom instead of just pulled here
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
and there to fill out the spaces in the
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
schedule so that no minute is left
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
unfilled in their day um so they can
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
truly collaborate and be part of a
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
learning team uh to support students um
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
and also have you know Specialists such
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
as a dedicated reading specialist in in
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
each Elementary building and the middle
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
schools um and um you know plenty of
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
onsite uh support from um school
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
counselors and perhaps a social worker
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
if if that is something that is needed
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
in the community um and and and many
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
other supports so that the students can
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
learn and thrive in the
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
school and a quick followup yes followup
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
so so so thanks and um and it it sounds
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
like what what what those districts are
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
doing is different than what this
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is suggesting but but is is
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
the science of reading is that a is that
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
a substitute for all the things you just
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
talked about well the science of reading
 
00:54:32.839 --> 00:54:34.789 align:start position:0%
talked about well the science of reading
is

00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
a wide
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary study that looks at
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
how students learn to read it crosses
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
many disciplines of science it does look
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
at more than just phonics and
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it does end up in a
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
discussion of phonics most often but it
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
covers uh
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
many domains the skill component skills
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
of learning to read
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I lost the rest of the
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
question it is not a substitute for
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
having u a a well-functioning
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
well-funded school and
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
um you know in a community where you
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of students who are coming
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
from another language background or
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
coming from uh a background
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
where you know you've got a lot of
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
families struggling at economically um
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
science of reading is only going to go
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
so far in
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
overcoming what students are bringing in
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
from outside the school so so a final
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
final followup on that thank thank you
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
so what um what I'm what I'm hearing you
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
say then is that is that while while
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
there there may be um evidence that
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
suggest the science of reading or that
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
that type of thing has has um some um
 
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.630 align:start position:0%
that type of thing has has um some um
some

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh benefit in terms of instruction and
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
materials if it's with without the
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
proper um resources in place to
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
implement it it may not actually move
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
the needle uh in the direction we think
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to go is that what I'm
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
hearing it can move the needle but it
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
can't do the whole job
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
because a child is not a robot so you
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
know they're bringing their whole life
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
in with them every day
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
so what happens outside affects what H
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
outside of school affects what they're
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
doing inside of school great thank you
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
very much any further questions thank
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
you very much Miss house and next we
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
newerk thank you madam chair um thanks
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak to you my
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
name is Tom new Kirk I taught at the
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire for 35 years
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
I've served on the oyst River School
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
Board for 11 uh I have one more day
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is the end of my career there
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm speaking for myself here I'm
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
not speaking for the board and I'm here
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
to speak in uh opposition to this uh
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment which really seems almost like
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
a new bill to me uh and um and it's the
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
objections I have are the same ones I
 
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
made last week because it seems to me
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
that it's important to figure out what
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
the impact of this bill is on local
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
districts and what pressure it places on
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
them this is a momentous bill as I see
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
it I think it would affect every school
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
every budget and it's important to
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
determine what the impact would be
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
financially and in terms of the demand
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
upon teachers of this bill um so one
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
thing that I did was I you know I I got
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
it on Thursday and first thing I did was
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
I circulated I I I gave it to one of the
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists who who's very
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
worked in a number of schools in New
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I I asked her just to
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
annotate it and give me her reaction to
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
it and she thought even with the robust
 
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
intervention we have at oer River which
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
is a very well-resourced
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
School District that has made a real
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
effort on Intervention this tier 2 kind
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
of intervention she looked through it
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
and said we couldn't do this we would
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
need additional staff to do this even
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
given the efforts that we have because
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
of the requirement for an individual
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
reading plan for every student in tier
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
two essentially and the all the
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
reporting and um really the the the
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
paperwork that this of course we don't
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
use paper I guess that's a term well
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you you know what I mean okay
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
um just the the requirement for
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
reporting recording uh communicating she
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
would think we we need extra Personnel
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
even at Oyster River where we've put so
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
much into it which made me think what
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
would happen in a district that didn't
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
have our resources and that had some
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
more serious issues because we have
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
relatively we have students who need
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
this but relatively fewer than other
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
districts that have more you know come
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
from maybe lower soci drawn lower
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic groups um so I I just as a
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
mental and this was I did this pretty
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
much looking kind of calculating on the
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
envelope what would happen in Manchester
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
went forward what would be the pressure
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
that was placed in
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester and so I did some
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
calculations and these are very rough
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm just kind of saying
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
this is the when when I I mentioned a
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
stress test when I came here before what
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
is the stress that this bill would put
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
on a district that had a large number of
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
students in this you know who would need
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
Improvement and they had to follow a
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
bill like this uh and in Manchester you
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
have I have some calculations here I'm
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
not going to just go through them but
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
essentially you have like almost 3,600
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
students in K through three um and if
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
you look at the test scores of you know
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state test scores grades 3 through 8
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
you you have almost 49% in the lowest
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
level okay that's 3 through eight and if
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
you if you assume that the 49% is the
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
figure for K through three or something
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
like that that and if you the 49% are
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
probably six 6 months behind grade level
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
if that's your
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
threshold you have something like um let
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
see I 1751 students who would fall into
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
that category
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
1751 and if you assume that some of
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
those are probably going to get some
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
special help anyways you know through
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
special education um if you even say 30%
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
which I think would be pretty generous
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
you come with 1225 students who would
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
fall into the category of needing an
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
independent reading plan according to
 
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.670 align:start position:0%
independent reading plan according to
this

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it would be tremendous
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
if every one of those students could get
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
that but what would it take could could
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
you say that and I think you need to say
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
that in a in a city like Manchester with
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
their resources as they stand because
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill if it's passed would be in
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
operation if you pass it in May it would
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
be you know operative in July they would
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
have to be have this all in place and
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
they would have to have at least if you
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
count if these figures are even close
 
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.670 align:start position:0%
count if these figures are even close
almost

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
1,200 create 1,200 independent
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
individualized reading programs I mean
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
is that even realistic where would the
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
where would it come
 
01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
from so it would seem to me I mean and
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
and you know these figures are just
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
approximate but I hope that you as a
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee look to see what the impact
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
would be of what you're asking
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay to create this is not just giving
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
support to to kids who need extra help
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
this is like creating a plan similar in
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways to what you do for a
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
special needs
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
student this is a very heavy
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
ask and so the reason I think that you
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
should at least be extremely cautious
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
about this bill and do your due
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
diligence is I think you need to see
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
what the impact would be on local school
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
districts what would they need to
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide that they you know that they
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
they might not be able to provide now
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
and I think in in low economic districts
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
it would be enormous it would be a huge
 
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.589 align:start position:0%
it would be enormous it would be a huge
huge

01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
ask and just
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
finally I think if you go into schools
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
now I think you'll see teachers under
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
amazing stress I think it's a very
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
difficult time to be a
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
teacher and I think one of the things
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things you wouldn't want to
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
do is to increase the demand upon them
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
without increasing the resources that
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
they need to fulfill that demand I think
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
that's a recipe for failure that's a
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
recipe for resentment that's a recipe
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
for feeling you know just increasing the
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
sense of stress the teachers feel now so
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll stop here because I know you
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do yeah yeah thank you
 
01:03:18.079 --> 01:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do yeah yeah thank you
representative

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
Dy thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm thinking
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
back back to what we opened this hearing
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
with with the quote that said once you
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
learn to read you're free forever and I
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
wonder if you if we've taken into
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
account the fact that this will help and
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
there will be benefit down the road so
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
are you adding that into the equation
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
yes it might take resources now but then
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
later I think that initially you'll need
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
resources all the way through because
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking longterm so I
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
think initially you're not going to be
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
able to pull everything out of fourth
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
fifth sixth grade to to to do this so I
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh initially there'd be it
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't you wouldn't you'd still
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to increase your Your Capacity with
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
the younger kids and and there's no
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's no funds here there's no you
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
know like in our district there's no way
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
we could even increase because the
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
budgets are set for next year so so so
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
longterm yeah I can see what you're
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
point I think but that's quite a long
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
ways down the road because initially I
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
think this would just put tremendous
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous pressure on districts can you
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
see that I mean I I think that's a long
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
longterm answer but in terms of the
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
short term in terms of that you're going
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
to you're going to just
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
overload the uh kind of referrals the
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
testing the uh paperwork for the uh for
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
that's um just one second do we have
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else I we're out um Mr new
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
kerk's pink card was the last one that I
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
had is there anyone else waiting to
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
speak oh do you have a pink card I don't
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
yeah can you can you just fill out a
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
pink card and and submit it please thank
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
you all right more questions
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you thank you
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question for being
 
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.390 align:start position:0%
for taking my question for being
here

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
so if if we accepted the premise that
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me that this set of protocols
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
should happen I don't necessarily accept
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
it but just that as a baseline to my
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
question and if we somehow believed that
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
there would be an abundance of resources
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
for these
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
grants um and disregarded they're
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
competitive so some districts would
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
apply needing money and not get it is
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
$75,000 per District anywhere near
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
this I think I think think it's a good
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
idea to have the
 
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
$75,000 I mean so i i u but I think the
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
answer is no because on the school when
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
I was on well I'm still on the school
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
board for more day that's right um uh we
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
always said like you can't use onetime
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
funds for long-term
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
projects you know and there's a tendency
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
to do that so you know you get you get
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
you know this happened with Esser funds
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
for some schools you but the Esser funds
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
were going to go away so so so so if you
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
get 75 $5,000 I think that would be
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
really useful for training I think that'
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
be really useful for um getting
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
materials for you know so I think it's
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
useful but I don't think I don't think
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
it solves this problem this is a per I
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
think a Personnel problem where you need
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
people to do this kind of work you need
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
more PA of professionals you need more
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
tutors uh and I think I think if you're
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
going to attack this problem you really
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
have to kind of put a lot of that money
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
or more you know in terms of personnel
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
earlier on that's that's what by even in
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
Oyster River we thought if you if we if
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
this was required we would have to hire
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
people we you know a $75,000 Grant not
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
that we get it anyways because I mean if
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
you have any kind of criteria we
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get it you know um uh um so so
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
even if even if you know you could get
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't solve that problem it's kind
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
things any further questions
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
representative belter thank you madam
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here uh I
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of of what you said but
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
there was there was one thing that I
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't totally clear on I wanted to
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit I heard you say
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
that this would be especially difficult
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
for the school districts that are in a
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
lower socioeconomic area um however my
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is given given uh State
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
funding formula we use free and reduced
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
launches a metric or a standin for that
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
and as a result those areas that are by
 
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
income status Lower socioeconomic status
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
are funded to a higher degree by the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
state so I'm trying to understand why it
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
would be more difficult for those areas
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
to fund it than anywhere else well I
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
think I think because still you have
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
districts like like Claremont that are
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
are struggling you know I mean even with
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
even I mean if you look at if you
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
compare I mean this compare Claremont to
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
Handover me 30 miles apart uh just the
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
the resources that Claremont has um are
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
so are so limited even even with the
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
additional State money okay um and to go
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
back to the earlier question one one of
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the things that happens in a poor
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
district is you have all kinds of
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
instability one thing I don't think
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
money buys you Excellence necessarily
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
but it buys you stability so that you
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
don't have teachers coming and
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
going now oyer River we don't have
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
teachers come and go we hire them they
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
stay where do we get them we go to
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
places like summersworth and Rochester
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
and take the teacher and that teacher
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
comes so we create instability in in in
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
places like Claremont in
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester and we have stability in our
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
district so you have all these
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
advantages that come I think from money
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
and and the state the state funding
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
difference doesn't nearly make up for
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
that thank you any further questions
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr newer the next
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
card and I believe the final speaker is
 
01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:37.950 align:start position:0%
card and I believe the final speaker is
Karen

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
llant good morning good morning thank
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for letting me speak today
 
01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:45.799 align:start position:0%
um I am my name is Camen La plant and I
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
am a reading specialist um in New
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I work at a middle school I've
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
had several years experience working in
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
both both Elementary um more years in
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
elementary than middle school but both
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
um my title is actually special ed
 
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
reading specialist because I work um
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
with a Special Education team at my
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
school and have over the past um several
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
years worked in that role so I have a
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
strong understanding of um both the
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
special ed process and um reading
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
development and
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
instruction um I wasn't completely
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak today so just took a
 
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
few notes might be a little all over the
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
place place but I also want to be able
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify and answer some questions
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
that came up um first of all I'd like to
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
say that I am um in support of the
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think what may be um not
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
emphasized enough is um you know there
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a comprehensive bill
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
um all the different components um being
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the screener for both reading and
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
spelling the reading interventions the
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
action plan um that needs to be
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
developed for each student which I will
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
say by the way yes an individual action
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
plan needs to be developed but that
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that student needs to
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
be seen oneon-one by an interventionist
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
so um many children um are seen in small
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
groups and um benefit from those
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
interventions um also um the fact that
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
it includes the products monitoring is
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
super important um the dyslexia bill is
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh certainly a step in the right
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
direction but because we only have the
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
screener in place for two times a year
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
it leaves um it leaves out an important
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
piece because that middle of the a
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
screener is very important so that
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
interventionists and teachers can adjust
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
their instruction uh based on that data
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
that comes in in the middle of the year
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that didn't make it
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
into the bill um the workshops for
 
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
parents and families and Educators is um
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
important for obvious reasons and the
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing um professional development for
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
teachers is essential I know we have the
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
um letters program right now um that was
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
implemented by the state which is
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful and many many teachers have
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of it but some have not
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately um the last round is
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
starting this
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
fall um and I believe it's full so it is
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
that we will still have teachers out
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
there that don't have the proper
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
training um the reporting the
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
accountability piece is important as
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
well and I'm glad that that's included
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
in this um Amendment we didn't have
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
accountability with the previous
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
dyslexia um bill and I know that that's
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh the dyslexia screening is is part of
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment too and I think that's
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
important for the state to know um who
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
how many students have risk factors what
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing to address them and how many
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
students are making progress are we
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
moving in the right
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
direction um the most important one the
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
most important parts of this bill I
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
think is the part that speaks to um in K
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
to five I understand the screen or k to3
 
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
um phonic skills uh yes they can and in
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
some cases should be taught in all the
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
way up through grade five for those
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
students who have not um mastered those
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
skills um in the K to3 grades but the
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
fact that we are in this bill it states
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
that there will be evidence-based
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
instruction and K through five I think
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
is very important and the reason why is
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
because if we
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
are doing what we need to do at that
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
tier one level with our core instruction
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see many kids as many
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
children that need tier 2 instruction
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly not tier three instruction
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes we are creating reading
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities by not providing the proper
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
instruction in schools and um you know
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
specifically schools that are using
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
programs that include
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh the 3 queing system um you know those
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
programs are actually harming um many
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
children there are certain children that
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
can learn to read with almost any type
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
of instruction but it's it's not the
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
majority of students the majority of
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
students need the explicit instruction
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
and when you're telling them you know
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
you come across a word that you don't
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't know you guess at that word um
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're really just doing them a
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
disservice so I'm I'm very happy to see
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that is also stated in the bill
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
that will not um
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
continue so couple of comments on um
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
what has come up today um for questions
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
I know that um representative cordelli
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
was asked um who are the interested
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
parties that were in that Prof specific
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
professional development um I was there
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
it was a summer professional development
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know in my district it was
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary um I saw every uh group of
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
teachers who are there representing
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
their schools and districts um engaged
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
working on projects to get the ball
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
rolling in um being able to um Implement
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
a screener and provide the interventions
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
and all of that um I would not you know
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a teacher uh many years as far as
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
professional development goes yes
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is mandatory
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
professional development that schools
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
will Implement in their school and say
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
oh it's professional development day
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
we're bringing this into our school and
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
we want you to be there and learn about
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
it but there are many many many many
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities that teachers voluntarily
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
go to and um having a large network of
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
people that I work with and colleagues
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
and that um I would say you know to
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
answer that question you know who are
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
the people who are interested I would
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
say all teachers who care about kids um
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
we have way too many kids in this state
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh who are not reading proficiently and
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have an answer to it and I feel that
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's time for us to act um I would also
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
say that any teachers in the district
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
which I think there are 2500 or maybe
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
3,000 I could be wrong who went through
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the letters training um I could I could
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
almost guarantee that they would
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
certainly be in favor of um the
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to to this bill and getting
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
these U the ball rolling with these um
 
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.430 align:start position:0%
these U the ball rolling with these um
this

01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um just looking to see if
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
there are any other questions oh the
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
grade level someone asked about um the
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
grade level directive measures I think
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you had asked about that um those are
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
determined um you know based on the
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
research certain assessments have um
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
been put in place in schools certain
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
screeners like for example Dibbles or as
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
web those type of screeners and they
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
have certain criteria that need to be
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
met by each grade level so for a
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
kindergartener um it would be looking at
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
um you know f of awareness uh letter
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
sound knowledge letter sound
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
correspondences um can they blend sounds
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
together and then for first grade it's
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask for those skills and a
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more and um each grade level
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
has a different uh set of subtests that
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
um enable uh the school to gather the
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
data that they need for that particular
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
grade level does that make sense so so
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
that's where that comes in so not every
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
student would be tested I think it goes
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
a through H year not every grade level
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
would need each one of these
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
subtests to determine that they are at
 
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
subtests to determine that they are at
grade

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
level um I think that is all I had does
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for me I
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
thought maybe I could does anybody have
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative luno thank you
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for for
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the the question that that I
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
had asked representative cordelli uh
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
earlier um the
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
um a question along that line though is
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
is where how are those benchmarks
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
established because my understanding is
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
Education has been shifting proficient
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
proficiency benchmarks in the last
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
couple of years I'm not quite sure um uh
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
in response to what but but we did hear
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
from them that that they've been
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
shifting and uh and then the the second
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
part of my question if I may have a
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
second part to this would be how would
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
this be um be implemented what what
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
would it take to implement this in the
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
school that you work in um sure so as
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
far as the state um you know the you
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
know schools look at grade level
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
standards and try to meet those
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
standards and the
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
assessments can vary per School District
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
as far as what they give students to
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
help determine if they're um progressing
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
and meeting grade level benchmarks um as
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
far as you know what the state is
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
actually um asking schools to do I mean
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
there's the SAS right and um you know
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
that's the the assessment that's given
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
once a year in grades uh I believe it's
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
three and yeah the Statewide assessment
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
yep um so I know that that data is
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
looked at at the state level but there's
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
nothing in place right now that at the
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
state level that I believe in that
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually looks at the um screeners and
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
progress monitoring that's done in
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
schools that's what I see happening with
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
this bill being put into place um and as
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
far as how something like this would be
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
put into place I do uh hear you guys as
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
far as you know personnel and the
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
finance and and that whole end of it but
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know schools could certainly use
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
some guidance on um having an efficient
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
model um I know that the district is now
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
talking about mtss multi- systems of
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill would align nicely
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
with that and um basically that system
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
of support if you're not familiar with
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
it works just like this bill does
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
basically you know you're screening
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
students you're looking at the data
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
you're um providing interventions where
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
interventions are need needed um
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to monitor students and um
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing there are three
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
tiers so there'd be the tier 2
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
instruction the tier three instruction
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
tier three isn't necessarily specialized
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
instruction special ed but sometimes it
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
is um so I think that this bill aligns
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
nicely I think individual schools would
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
need to look at their personnel their
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
model their systems that's a lot of what
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
we um had learned at that Workshop over
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
the summer was you know it's a it's a
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
systems change um but in the schools
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
that I've worked in I think one of the
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
best things schools can do is look at
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
their personnel and say where are their
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
strengths what are their
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
training and how can we make this work
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
within our school by shifting some of
 
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
our um structures within the
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
school um I think schools that do have
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know reading Specialists and a
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
reading team are certainly going to be
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
able to to tackle this more so than
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
schools that don't but but I do believe
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the majority of schools now have
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists um a lot of schools
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
have now taken on the role that I have
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
as special reading specialist in
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
addition to their regular red reading
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
specialist so schools that have teams
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
like that could certainly um take this
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
on thank you any further
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions and oh yes representative
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
leus thank you thank you for coming and
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
speaking to us um so do you feel feel
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
doable I
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
do I do the the components that I can
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
speak to as you know my role um uh
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly I do I've seen similar
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
structures happening in schools that may
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
just need to be um boosted up a little
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
bit tweaked here and there um but we do
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are screeners that are actually
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
free that you can use um and that I've
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
used in schools um that have helped us
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
monitor progress and put students into
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
intervention groups and I've seen great
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
gains when you have you know highly
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers and interventionists
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
students thank you thank you any further
 
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.590 align:start position:0%
students thank you thank you any further
questions

01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
and um a question of the chair uh I
 
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if there are any more cards
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
in there but I was I was wondering if we
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
might be able to hear from the um School
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
administrators Association because I do
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
have a question with respect to um
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
implementation and given the fact that a
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
lot of uh school districts pass their
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
budget for uh for next year uh uh
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday or
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
Saturday or Tom or tomorrow yeah the
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
recent passing of or or passing budgets
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is of significant concern for
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
many reasons not just this bill but yes
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
if if uh uh anybody would else would
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
like to speak to answer representative
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
Luna's question that would be
 
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
Luna's question that would be
appreciated

01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
Y and so I think yeah I I you know I
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
think my question to the chair was made
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
made the question pretty clear but but
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of a of a comprehensive
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
program like that given the fact that U
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
that budgets are um are are in the
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
approval process final approval process
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
right now and that implementation in
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would begin January of 2025
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
halfway through the school
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
year thank you Mr F Dr
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
fro thank you welcome good morning Madam
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the committee this morning um
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions I was
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
not prepared I actually came from a an
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
event um to get over here for because we
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
were supposed to have somebody in the
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
audience for the next bill so uh the
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
work session so anyway uh getting to to
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
the point and thank you for the
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address it um there are
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
school districts who have already
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
adopted their budgets for um next year
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh or will be having pretty important
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
votes tomorrow uh or over the next
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
weekend if if any live in the area may
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
have seen the issues that the Pembrook
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
School District are are faced with um
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the potential for a a huge budget
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
cut coming from the floor of their
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
school district meeting school districts
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
are not in a position right now to be
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
adding additional staff to Implement any
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to be quite honest
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um whether it's this or or any decisions
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are made moving forward the the
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
budgets for next year are adopted uh
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
within the next weeks for the most part
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
significant uh shifting that is
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
suggested um we are we can't find people
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do some of these jobs right now uh
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are there are
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
um challenges in in a number of
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
districts and and have the opportunity
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
to meet around the state in different
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
regions and just
 
01:25:23.239 --> 01:25:25.390 align:start position:0%
regions and just
finding

01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
um just finding folks let alone quality
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
folks uh that are that are trained and
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
able to do this and this is not a
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
condemnation to this to this bill and
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the the curriculum that's advocated
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
the letters training we have a staff
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
member who's attended the letters
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic the money however in all of
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
the grants that people talk about are
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
drying up school districts are hitting
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
um major decisions with Staffing and
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
supporting um the monies that are that
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
are being appropriated and so every time
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
a decision is made to spend local funds
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it's one
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
more crushing blow to local school
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
districts and um it's again it's not
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
about the methodology here uh teaching
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
kids uh the components of this bill is
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do um but where do
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
we find the
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's not just finding a warm body we
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
can't find people to do the lunchroom uh
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
let alone uh to teach kids struggling
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
read um directly to direct
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
follow so thank thank you very much Dr
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
Fu so um if we were able to to set aside
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's difficult to hire
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
people let's assume we could fi find
 
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.750 align:start position:0%
people let's assume we could fi find
find

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
whoever school districts needed to um to
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
to to um implement
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
this do you believe there's a way of
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
estimating the Statewide local cost to
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
to provide um to implement this bill uh
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
K3 3 times a
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
year and I think there's some other I
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
think I saw maybe a fifth something
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
through fifth grade too somewhere but to
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
implement this bill a way to estimate
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
the Statewide cost to implement this
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill um Statewide serving you know
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
students thank you for the question
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative um there's always a way
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's a question of how um efficient
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
and how robust the data is and what the
 
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
current data should
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
right every school district has
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
different numbers of the of the number
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
of children that might need these
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
interventions right so everybody has
 
01:28:00.639 --> 01:28:01.629 align:start position:0%
interventions right so everybody has
that

01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
information um it's collecting it and
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
translating that to appropriate tier 2
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
level support and the potential for
 
01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:11.910 align:start position:0%
level support and the potential for
special

01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
education uh implications uh those those
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
are the wild cards if you will and
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um perhaps over time that could be done
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
but but I don't see how that could be
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
done in the next 60 days or 90 days
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
or thank you thank you representative
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
you for being here that brings me to my
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
question if we were to change the
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
effective date because the budgeting
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
process is largely underway in terms of
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
making this bill ready for the next
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
budget would that address a lot of your
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you representative for
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
the question uh it would certainly give
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
a runway for people to determine the the
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
financial impact as well as the state to
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
be honest to help support local school
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
districts because uh I you know the the
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
um and just let me site an example that
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with all right when I was a
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent at
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
kirar because of our budget
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
situation as superintendent I had to be
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to present my budget for the
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
following year to the school board by
 
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.270 align:start position:0%
following year to the school board by
September

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
1st think about that September 1st and
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
then there were a series of Schoolboard
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
meetings and Municipal budget committee
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
meetings throughout all of the towns so
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
that they could have a deliberative
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
session the first Saturday in January
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then vote by ballot the second
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in March on on the ballot so
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
those are um kind of the timelines that
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
would be needed for legislation to take
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
effect in 2026 or 2025
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
I actually have a question um what do
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
you think the academic outcome for
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
students would be if we do not enact
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation thank you for the
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
question Madam
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not arguing that the
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't need to be
 
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
enacted um I believe that academic
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes can improve significantly
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
um given the right conditions the the
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
right learning conditions and that's
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
that seldom takes place the conditions
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
of for learning seldom take place in a
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
conversation uh in the legislature but
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
they take place all the time in
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
classrooms and offices in our state and
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
in our community so I do believe there's
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
hope to improve the performance
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely there there is uh and we have
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
um we have instruments and tools in the
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
toolkit that can be available but they
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.510 align:start position:0%
toolkit that can be available but they
all

01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
the resources of time in the school day
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
and uh demands on Staffing thank you we
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
do have another hearing coming up so is
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
this really pertinent to this or could
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
it wait for our executive
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
session you can I'm just wanted to make
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we know we have an agenda to
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
keep today too thank you thank you for
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I represent about
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
half of Sullivan County which includes
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
Claremont Cen sonap and several other
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
small towns it's been referenced by
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
prior speakers Claremont as is
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
frequently an example of a inadequately
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
funded struggling school
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
system I think there are some amazing
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
Professionals in Claremont who work very
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
very hard at educating students but they
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
are the training ground and then the
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
stability question that was mentioned
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
earlier is very
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
real further Foundation from my question
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
cin and Arc Force school has a basically
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
four-person Staffing and we have been
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
absent one full-time staff member for
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
two consecutive
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
years so with those examples and there
 
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
are many many others throughout the
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
state as you know would you comment on
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
what we need to be doing to provide the
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
Staffing that would support this kind of
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
Bill you've said that you're not opposed
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
to uh the programming the screening and
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
programming and the bill but that we
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
simply don't have the people we need so
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
what would
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
help thank you for the question
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative I do believe that there
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
has to be flexibility and and decision
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
making available at the local level um
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
for um Staffing in in the ways that they
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
feel fit for the the four person croen
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
staff or the or of Manchester um
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
there has to be flexibility and and
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to entertain talented
 
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity to entertain talented
individuals

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
um locally and then the small rural
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
communities see this every day up up the
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley along the river up in the
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
North Country um Staffing is a is a
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
major problem so uh we have to have
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility to to help accommodate and
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
make accommodations for those staff I
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't maybe it was actually it was a
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
here the meeting that I was in to hours
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
ago that was talking about making
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
accommodations for
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
staff thank you thank you any further
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions and seeing none we will close
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing on the non gerain amendment
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
10:15 we'll take a five minute break
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:44:25.550 align:start position:0%
 
session

01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
our work session on the various
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
structures organizations of uh schools
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
in in the
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
state and just to make sure does
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee have one of
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
these packets because we'll look at that
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
first before we look at yeah right
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay what I what I put together is
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
just so so folks will have a a an
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of what some of these
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
agreements look like between Cooperative
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
school districts seeing that the bills
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
which we're dealing with today are not
 
01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
all Cooperative school districts but
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
they do allude and speak to various
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
issues uh referencing Cooperative school
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
districts so I do have if there's
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
anybody out there that maybe wants to
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
follow along there are a couple extras
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
of these right here now um if if
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
somebody would like does anybody want to
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
have a copy there there's two exas right
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
there thank you is one here yeah I'm
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
going to give her this one and I'll take
 
01:45:31.239 --> 01:45:32.270 align:start position:0%
going to give her this one and I'll take
the

01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
through Barrett are you willing to enter
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
in part of this discussion so you might
 
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
want to come up to the table if you
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
would please I know you're the resident
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
this but uh in moving forward now um in
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
and and looking at that first sheet
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
which you have there which there is five
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
pages to it it lists the Cooperative
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
school districts which we have now
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
granted yes this is written July 1 2017
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
but those Cooperative schools districts
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
are pretty much here and and and you can
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
look at the message which that provides
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
you starting off with con of cook and
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
looking down through Dairy Dron Etc as
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
she move down um uh as you're looking at
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
the the quop names on the left hand side
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see a small check mark by some of
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
them those are ones where we have copies
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the agreements when they were
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
originally put together so that you can
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
follow that up and look at the agreement
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
with is uh governing that particular
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
District but in looking at this I also
 
01:46:59.550 --> 01:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
underlined uh for you uh various
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
sections under each one of those which
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
show the
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh ratio between average
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
daily membership and equalized property
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
valuation there are some coops here that
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
fund totally based upon ADM only
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
that there are some that use the uh uh
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
some ratio perhaps for Capital costs
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements there's others that
 
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
might be funding 90% ADM 10% based upon
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
equiz property
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
valuation and I don't know the exact
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
date in which Cooperative school
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
districts but we're basically going back
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
1960s and when they came about and some
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
of these agreements were established and
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
haven't been really changed since that
 
01:47:50.119 --> 01:47:51.350 align:start position:0%
haven't been really changed since that
time

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
but the individual town or district has
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of property valuation in terms
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
of population of of uh
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
students and this has become a bone of
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
contention between many of the districts
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
one of the districts which you'll see in
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the in this report here after you'll see
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
all the agreements
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
um let's see where that one is located
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
um there there was a report an
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
investigation done pursuant to uh what
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
was going on with the district uh in
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
which we have up north where the town of
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
Carol is a part of that particular
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
Co-op and they've had a number of
 
01:48:37.589 --> 01:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
appeals which have gone right to the
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
State Board saying you know we're paying
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
how much money per student it's over
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
$440,000 per student whereas you might
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
have some of the smaller other towns
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
within only paying $9,000 per student
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
and they're saying our population
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
changed our our our economic base in the
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
community is certainly not the same as
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
it was back then and it's simply not
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
affordable uh that that's something we
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
may want to look at when you look at the
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
town of Carol and Dalton and Jefferson
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
Lancaster Whitefield you can see that
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
the town of Carol um has very few
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
students in relation to you know perhaps
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh others so so that is something we
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
might want to look at I'm just going
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
through this very quickly also we have
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
had in the past a number of bills
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with how people on the quop
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
board are elected and do they have to be
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
coming from the specific town in which
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're representing or they voted at
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
large uh you have some co-ops where all
 
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
members are voted at large I live in one
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's others which uh are very very
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
different from that and so I have asked
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
Barrett to come forward and and explain
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit about some of these
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
agreements and some of the issues which
 
01:49:59.310 --> 01:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
we've encountered um we certainly have
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
more information to explain some at the
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
last article in this whole packet you
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
can see there's a uh about a lawmaker
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
proposes the dissolving Co-op school
 
01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
districts totally and reworking and
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
going forward he's sitting to my right
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
and that article is you know he has some
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful you know is in there which
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
he's explained to the conquered monitor
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
but um in dealing with even the I
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
concept of going with tuition programs
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the The Coop so look at that
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
as well but Barrett welcome and if you
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
have anything that you you know I think
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
we what the whole objective of this is
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of give a little uh prefix to
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of co-ops and why they
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe were established and and and they
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
how they exist today and they are they
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
doing what they were initially sought to
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
be doing sure thank you very much
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
chairman lad good morning members of the
 
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee um I don't have anything
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
specific to really say more here just to
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
be a resource as the committee is
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
sorting through I think it's a half a
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
dozen or so Co-op bills um a little
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
history of of the of of the Cooperative
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
school districts though if you look
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
through the the document that chairman
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
lad handed out you'll see that many of
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative school districts were
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
formed within maybe a three or foure
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
period and sort of the early and mid
 
01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
1960s um that was because the the
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
general Co-op law that we know it today
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
um as we know today RSA
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
195 um that version is is is the laws
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know it today has its Origins not
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
entirely but mostly in about
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
1963 there was a Statewide effort um
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
spearheaded in part by the legislature
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
and by the Department of Education at
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
the time to uh regionalized school
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
districts as a cost-saving mechanism
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
essentially um rather than having a say
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
a high school for each Town some of
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
these small talents with a th000 people
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
1200 people it didn't make sense for
 
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
them to have a to have their own their
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
own high school um from a from a fiscal
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
standpoint um but they also wanted those
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
communities to just um to not just
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
tuition districts Over the River and
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
Through the Woods as we like to say they
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
wanted that Community to have some stake
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
or bu in or skin in the game if you will
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
in um not just facilities but
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
administrative functions as well too and
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
the district as a whole um you know we
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
used to phras a Cooperative School
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
District or a Regional School District
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
um and the legislature again this is
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
sort of just going back from my own my
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
own research the purpose of of the
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District Circa
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
1963 um was to to regionalize school
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
districts to build high schools um cuz
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
most of these Talent would obviously
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
have their own sort of K through 5 K
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
through 6 K through 8 school district um
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
and also share some of the costs with
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
the uh that would be attenuated from
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
from building a facility um curiously as
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
as some members of the committee may
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
know they built the building aid program
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
an RSA
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
9815 wherever that is in the in the
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
statute where if you're a Cooperative
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
School District you received more
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid based on the number of of
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
school districts that you had within
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
your Cooperative School District if you
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
had a three Town Co-op you got a certain
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
percent of your building Aid if you had
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
a four Town Co-op you got another 5% a f
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
Town Co-op another 5% on top of that um
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
and also sort of curiously the my
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um the
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education at the time
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
back in the the late 50s and early 60s
 
01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
he went on a barn storming tour of the
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
state to sell the idea to the to the
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
local communities saying that this is a
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
good idea the state will help you build
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
your high school we'll regionalize we we
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
save money on on administrative costs on
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
facility costs um and also everybody
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
would have would have stake in the game
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
if you will in that in that political
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
subdivision The Cooperative School
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
District um we know that I mean fast
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
forward now 50 years ago or 50 years
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
since um we hear Rumblings from time to
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
time in a co-op here or a co-op there
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
about one town perhaps wanted to
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the co-op or one town is
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
um uh uh not um not in favor of the
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
apportionment method that the voters
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
have have have adopted previously so
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
we've had some bills in this committee a
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
number of bills I'd say the last six
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
years or so addressing Co-op some have
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
gone through some some have not um I
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
think um um chairman lad is so sick of
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
me saying this but I'm going to say it
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
again since I have the microphone that I
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
think we need the study commission sir
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
um again nhs's recommendation going back
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
a number of years would be a two-year
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
study commission to look at RSA 195 and
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
its entirety in its totality and I
 
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and I we've talked about
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
this and I know why that's not an option
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
right now but I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
keep saying until until until I get my
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
way I
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
guess um I kid um but anyway um so yeah
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
I mean there are there are there are
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
also Pockets you know nhs's position
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
generally with the number of Co-op bills
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
that we've had the last number of years
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
is that I think the law as it's written
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
is the law is not perfect there's room
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
for Change and updating in the in in
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
throughout RSA 195 I won't I won't
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
dispute that but I think Mo I think the
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
statutes as they are allow for um allow
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
for resolution of the issues that may be
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
popping up in one particular town or or
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
one particular Co-op um I also will say
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
too there are there are 32 Cooperative
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
school districts across the state you
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
know from time to time on any particular
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
Bill we'll get people representing one
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
Co-op two co-ops maybe maybe three
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
co-ops that come and testify they in
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill or whatnot but I think
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
by and large um the way the co-ops are
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
operating Statewide anyway um seems to
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
be the the people in those communities
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
again just anecdotally from what I'm
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and from seeing people that come
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
down come down to conquer to testify
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
that by and large things things work
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
well um with the the current structure
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
and within current articles of agreement
 
01:56:24.589 --> 01:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
that that create these these Cooperative
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
school districts um but um so I don't
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
know I think I'm just kind of rambling
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
at at this point I mean I'm certainly
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions or be
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
whatever resource I can for the
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee but without a specific
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
question directed at me it just kind of
 
01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
babbling along okay maybe one one thing
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
we can do sort of Might generate some
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
questions let's turn to one of these
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement let's turn to the
 
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
one dealing with gorm Olf and shelburn I
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
picked one from the North Country um so
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
that if you can hunt through your packet
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
here and come down to the agreement that
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
that uh there's not page numbers it's
 
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.950 align:start position:0%
that uh there's not page numbers it's
it's

01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
about maybe a quarter third the way the
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
way down in it's up in it says 95- five
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
other words 95% of the cost is based
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
upon ADM and the 5% based upon equiz
 
01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.510 align:start position:0%
upon ADM and the 5% based upon equiz
property

01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
valuation um one of the things I like
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
about what they have in their artical
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
agreement and which is something that
 
01:57:32.109 --> 01:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and I have
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
talked about in the
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
past is that if you see going down where
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
it says members of the cooperate School
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
Board shall be elected by the
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
voters um and going through and and read
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the pre-existing districts they
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
represent and must be residents of those
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
the at large shall be elected by vote of
 
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
the three pre-existing districts voting
 
01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
will be by the individual Town check
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
towns checklist all members elected
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the organizational meeting
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
shall be elected to threeyear terms at
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
the regular Town elections and it goes
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
on reapportionment of the coopa school
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
board may be proposed at any time in
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
accordance with New Hampshire statute
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
but in any case the ement as specified
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
above shall be subject to review for
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
possible amendments in 2010 and every 5
 
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.189 align:start position:0%
possible amendments in 2010 and every 5
years

01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
thereafter some districts do not have
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
this this phraseology at the bottom
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
there where they're required to look at
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
these agreements every five years but
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
then you have to look at okay who's
 
01:58:39.069 --> 01:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
making that decision and where are all
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
the votes weighted they're waited to the
 
01:58:42.069 --> 01:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
town of course that loves what they've
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
got going on maybe so um looking at this
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
they have 11 people on their board board
 
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
have to have an odd number anywhere up
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
to what is it 13 I believe 13 or 15
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester is 15 but because they're a
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
city they may be a little bit different
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
I believe Rochester is 13 but again a
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
city they're Charter or maybe different
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
I think the largest that I'm aware of
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
would be conil which I think is either
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
11 or 13
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so let let's just open this up to
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
some of the questions and issues that
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
people may have in their minds right now
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of The Cooperative school
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
districts apportionment or how they pay
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at that town of
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
going further north where I talk about
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
Carol and Dron and white Whitefield and
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
that there is one particular Community
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's getting hammered pretty hard and
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
yet they can't get out because they
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
out yes represent dry I think you may
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
have hit you know one of the nails on
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
the head and unfortunately we don't have
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
like fall mountains um
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh original agreement yeah um because I
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
think there is one town that has a
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
better equal equalized value was the
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
problem but the the contract was or the
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
original agreement was based on ADM how
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
do you change that if things have
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
1966 bar could you walk through for
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
example when how this occurs because
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
there has to be certain votes and then a
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation goes forward to the State
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
Board of Education you we have two
 
02:00:23.709 --> 02:00:23.719 align:start position:0%
reports going up and the state board has
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
to make a decision on one or the other
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
um well that's only if if a town is
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
looking to withdraw from from TR to get
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
out in terms of changing the articles of
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that's simply a vote of the
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
body of the voter of the voters of that
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District I understand
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
in some concerns that if the town has a
 
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote good deal and they've got
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
the larger population there there
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's I understand there's not
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily an incentive for them to
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
change the the apportionment formula or
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be to the to the you
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
know stated or alleged detriment of one
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
of the other towns in the in the um in
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
the um in the Cooperative school
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
district one
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
of one of NHS Ba's frustrations is that
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
when when we're talking about the ort
 
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll get to the appeal in a second
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative when we get to and I'm
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go on a school funding
 
02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
rant or tangent here but but when people
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
are complaining about their property tax
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
that gets back to the to to the
 
02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism with which we fund our schools
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that one town is going
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
to pay more and you know that's the it
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
can't be it can't be even it's just not
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to be the mathematics just don't
 
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
work out if you've got a 100 kids you're
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay a higher rate than the town
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
that has 500 kids in that Co-op that's
 
02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
just the economics of it so um you know
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of appealing to the
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
to the to the Cooper appealing to
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
withdraw there is a process in statute I
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:55.430 align:start position:0%
believe it's
195

02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
195
 
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:57.390 align:start position:0%
195
colon

02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
colon
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry it's it's in this it's in
 
02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 195 I forget the specific um sub
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
chapter of that I'm looking at it now
 
02:02:08.189 --> 02:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
was it 18 maybe
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
19 um where a town can can can put on
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
the warrant article you can do this both
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
at the Cooperative School District or if
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
you're the pre-existing town you can put
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
it on your Town warrant not necessarily
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
the school district warrant to initiate
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
a a a a study of your current
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district and the town
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
that initiates that can look at
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from a Cooperative School
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
District they can look at changing the
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement um if they are
 
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
looking to withdraw um there's a process
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
in in statute where they have to go
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
through a uh um you have to go through I
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's an 180 day study committee
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
locally that and statute tells you who
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
has to be on the committee um they look
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
at the numbers they look at the
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
apportionment and then that vote is is
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
sent out um we changed that law was that
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
just just last year we changed the law
 
02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
for the three- fifths voting and and and
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
and and calculating the vote on withdraw
 
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
if the withdraw goes through it has to
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education to
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the withdraw plan has all
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
the elements that the the statute
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
requires that are checked off I don't
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
think the state board has any particular
 
02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
authority to weigh in whether or not
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
they think it's the withdrawal is a good
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea it's it's more does
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
the plan list all the the things that
 
02:03:27.149 --> 02:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
the that the statute says that plan has
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
to um include and then it goes back to
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
the to the voters again um to um if if
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the State Board allow allows the
 
02:03:37.069 --> 02:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
withdraw if it goes back to the to the
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
voters again to to formalize um to
 
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
formalize the vote uh upon withdrawing
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that town then withdraws from that
 
02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District they are no
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
longer a no longer a community that
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District the last sa
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the last Cooperative School
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
District that we I think we've had a
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
couple here and there break apart a town
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
here a town there over the last maybe 15
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
years um I think the most significant
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
one to my recollection would be um the
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
madok Regional School District um they
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
had two or three towns withdraw I want
 
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
to say in the mid to late 2000s sui for
 
02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
example withdrew Sullivan withdrew I
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
believe hin Dale used to be part of
 
02:04:21.629 --> 02:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
manano if I'm if I'm not mistaken as
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
well too so um that was um probably like
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
2008 2009 um there have not been too
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
many withdrawal Co-op withdrawals that I
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
can think of off the top of my head in
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
the last maybe 15 years or
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you and just so just to
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
expand on that um I'm not sure that
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal was the is the answer in that
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
case because they tried to withdrawal
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
and it it didn't pass right
 
02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that a different it
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
might just be the terms of the you know
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
the co Cooperative district is the
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
answer but the terms are not um what
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
they want and so you're saying the
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
better they can do that internally they
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes so I I should have
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
clarified to for starting from the
 
02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
beginning Cooperative school districts
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
and and somewhere in the packet are
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
governed by what are called articles of
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
agreement it's essentially a contract
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
between the communities that have that
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
have chosen to form this Cooperative
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
school district and create this
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District those those
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement can be altered or
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
amended it has to be approved by the
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
voters obviously but you don't have to
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education you
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't go have to go to the to the
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I think you have
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
an obligation to submit your your your
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
your new um articles of agreement to the
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
department but they're not involved in
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
the process at all and um but so yeah
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
you can change you can change your
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
apportionment formulas you can change
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know is it population is a property
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
values whatever that might be that can
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
be done sort of internally by a study
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
group of the board if you will or the
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
communities and they're put out to the
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
voters to change the articles of
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
agreement representa
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
leus if you have a small school district
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
or a number of small school districts
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
and a large school district is it then
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
possible that
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
the small District which either wants to
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
change the Articles of Confederation or
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
wants to withdraw can be outvoted by the
 
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
larger school district and thus actually
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
not be able to do anything yeah thank
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question I we've seen that
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we've heard testimony to that effect
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
the last few years in this in this room
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
haven't we um that's one of the yeah
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
that was one of the frustrations with
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
some some individuals that came and
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
spoke that excuse me they're in the
 
02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
smallest town Within the co-op and so
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
they know Co-op whyde they'll never have
 
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
the votes to change everything um I know
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
we changed the the co-op with draw I
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
forget the exact numbers the three-
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
fifths and super majorities and things
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that nature that that that that this
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee and nhba nhsb worked on I
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
um to some degree there needs to be a
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
change of mindset I think among whether
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
you're in the small town or the large
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
Town The Cooperative school districts
 
02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:21.629 align:start position:0%
Town The Cooperative school districts
were

02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
created again sort of bringing people
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
together and and and the one aspect of
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
creating the the co-ops back in the in
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
the in the 60s that I didn't mention is
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
that property Rich talents were
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
purposely joined with property poor
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
towns with sort of a recognition that
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're all in this together right and
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
that you know even though I live in town
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
X I still have a a vested interest in
 
02:07:46.549 --> 02:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
making sure the kids in town wide get a
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
proper education as well too um sort of
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
a Statewide recognition um but um um
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
where was it so so you know and I
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
understand that you know if you're if
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're elected from town a you have uh
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
your first duty is obviously to the
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
constituents in town a that elected you
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
but you also have further obligations as
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
a Schoolboard member to the district as
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
a whole to all the kids um and not just
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
all the kids but pres we all the
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and as well to cooperative you
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
know we're it's a it's a group concept
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a group mindset so you know maybe
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to be able to compromise a
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
little bit more and say you my taxes may
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
go up a nickel but next door their taxes
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
are going to go down a dime and it's
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
still good for everybody I mean I'm not
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not the one that has to live that
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not the one that has to
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
negotiate that but the the concept or
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
the notion or the mindset that it it
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's the collectively it's what best for
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative School District not
 
02:08:49.149 --> 02:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily what's best for this town or
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
what's best for this town but I mean
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
those are decisions made by locally
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
elected officials in their communities
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not you know that that's not for me
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
to to say but rather sort of looking at
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
the broader concept of of why we had
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
co-ops to begin with thank you thank you
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
we had go ahead r s
 
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr here I just wanted to
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
clarify for my own sort of benefit how
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
this how this kind of works um it seems
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
to me that based on the fact that things
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
change I mean Industries and towns can
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
change residencies can change over you
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
know years and
 
02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
decades it seems that because there is
 
02:09:32.189 --> 02:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for a single town to
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
reliably initiate a withdrawal by itself
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
from an
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that it's at least conceivable
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
that within a district as things do
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
change and one town may become more
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
property rich or poor the more town
 
02:09:52.270 --> 02:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
within that District or the the more
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
original districts within that
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District that um are
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
benefiting from that change compared to
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
one town that may be not benefiting from
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
that change it actually seems the more
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
tilted it becomes the more difficult it
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
is for one town to possibly get out is
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
is that accurate yeah thank for the
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
question representative I that that's
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
certainly a a fair and reasonable way to
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
look at it AB absolutely abolutely yeah
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
if you have two districts A and B in a
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
co-op just two and a wants to get
 
02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
out okay it's going to be very difficult
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
for them to get out seeing that then
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
this District here that remains as a
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
single District it's going to have to
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
buy all the capital investment that town
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
a has and it's a huge cost yeah and
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if I if I may
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
expound on that chairman lad let's be
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
clear to the withdrawals
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
and and when the study commission is
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these things it's not
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
always just about I mean the the
 
02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision the ultimate factor is
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
not always just about sort of a portion
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
formula um for example if there's a an
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding Bond on a building the town
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
that that that's looking to withdraw
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
they still owe even if they withdraw
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
because that agreement was they bonded
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
that with that town in there and those
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
other three other communities were
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
counting on the revenue from that fourth
 
02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
community so it it it and and then and
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
then you've got to you've got to pay to
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
get out where where are the facilities
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
who's going to buy the facility you know
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
if you have the if you have the let's
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
say the high school in your town or your
 
02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
community as opposed to you know little
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
Elementary School K through 4 that's
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to impact you know what you buy
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
out what other people have to pay in
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
there are collective bargaining
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
agreement issues that that come into
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
come into play with this as well too
 
02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
because if you have staff that are part
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
of the Cooperative school district
 
02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
teachers union and then a town withdraws
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
that carries half their staff with them
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
suddenly you're going to have to create
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
a new bargaining unit over here as well
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
too you're going to have to start from
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
scratch with a with a with with a new
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
with a new collective bargaining
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
agreement as well too so it's not always
 
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
just about taxes it's about buildings
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
and facilities and staff and and taxes
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
are one part of it I'm not going to
 
02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:11.559 align:start position:0%
overlook that fact um but there are a
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
myriad of of factors that that the study
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
commission study committee excuse me has
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
to look at locally when they're
 
02:12:21.549 --> 02:12:21.559 align:start position:0%
considering these
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
factors further yes represent cordelli
 
02:12:27.669 --> 02:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
then represent tannah thank you
 
02:12:31.069 --> 02:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
um um I I think uh chairman lad you
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
touched on um Carol and the White
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
Mountain Regional School District and as
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
in the middle of our packet there is the
 
02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
um letter from the State Board of
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
Education to the White Mountain Regional
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
School District um and it touches on the
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
um under
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
19529 um if the majority voters uh
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
reject a plan the withdrawing districts
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
has the right to appeal to the State
 
02:12:59.470 --> 02:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
Education but the final outcome from the
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
state board's investigation of the vote
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
in uh the White Mountain Regional School
 
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
District is um that uh state board of
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
education has no authority to reverse
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the election right so uh
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
basically they're they're stuck they I
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
think this was the third or fourth
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
attempt by Carol to withdraw from that
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
school district um so I I think that you
 
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
know that goes to the whole uh voting um
 
02:13:41.470 --> 02:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
and um make up uh a problem um but I
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
think Switching gears to a different
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
branch um if I might um it reflects also
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
um in the membership and we had a bill
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
this year and it's on our list here
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
1383 that um got into a little bit of
 
02:14:03.149 --> 02:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
the membership of the board um of the
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative district and that goes back
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
to what chairman lad mentioned also um
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
we had a bill in
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
202 yeah um SB 353 and I think a copy is
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
attached or we have copies where we
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
tried to address that because um uh I
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
think Mr Christina mentioned it's it's a
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
collective um but in many districts that
 
02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
Collective votes for the member of a
 
02:14:35.079 --> 02:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
Collective votes for the member of a
little

02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
town um I know that's the case in our
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
district where uh poor little Effingham
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
um wants to elect someone from their
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
Town um which is fine but the entire
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
Cooperative right votes on who that
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
member from Effingham should be so very
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
often um it's the um maybe the um
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
locality the largest locality where the
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh sa is headquartered everything else
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
they want their person who they like in
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
Effingham to be on the board so that's
 
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
who gets voted in not the necessarily
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the person that that um a lot of people
 
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
in Effingham want or the majority of
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's the last election the majority of
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
people in Effingham wanted person X but
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
person B got voted in because wolfb
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
wanted them right so I think that's a
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
problem and that's something we
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
certainly can address that's something
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
we do need to address and and and going
 
02:15:41.709 --> 02:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
on just to while you're looking at that
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
that the the the co-op that we're
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
talking about Whitefield Carol and
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
dressed in that if you go to page five
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
and six you can see why Carol's so upset
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're paying
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
$46,000 per
 
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
pup Dalton Jefferson Lancaster and white
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
pay 99,100 14,700 5,700 8
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
9,700 per
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
pupil if you Liv in Carol would you have
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
concern in that in that investigation
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
findings the on on uh that represent
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
cordelli was mentioning that report if
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
you look at Pages five and six of that
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
of that report at the bottom of page
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
five you'll see yet Carol pays a per
 
02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
puple tuition rate of 46
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
Grand it's about half it's about halfway
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
packet and on the top of uh page six you
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
can see one two3 the other four
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
districts what they
 
02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
pay 9,000 14,000
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
5,000 9,000 per
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
pupil this is why Carol has gone to the
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
state board so many times on this and
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
remember you got you have to have when
 
02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get out you have to
 
02:17:05.309 --> 02:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
write a report uh which is going to deal
 
02:17:05.319 --> 02:17:06.629 align:start position:0%
write a report uh which is going to deal
with

02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
sustainability and and and and how
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to function and then move
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
on then two reports go to the state
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
board and the State Board looks at and
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
sees if you checked all those budget
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
boxes it comes back and of course it's
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
like a gorm where you have six board
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
members coming from
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
gorum one from
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
shelburn and one from Randolph and three
 
02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.830 align:start position:0%
shelburn and one from Randolph and three
at

02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
large and you can see how that's all
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
going to stack up goram's going to have
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
the six that's out of the board of 11
 
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
they already have a majority but then
 
02:17:45.309 --> 02:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
they control the at large as well so Mr
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
chair yes so so thanks and I and I do
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
recall I found the the the page you
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
referenced and I do recall having this
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
conversation I think on a couple of
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
several bills that we've looked at over
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
the over the last um few terms um but
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
but you know even even looking at the
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the bottom of page of
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
of that report page five you know it
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
talks about how back in 1963 something
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
was a certain way and and over um over
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know five decades things have uh
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
things have changed and now now the
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
ratios are out of whack is that that's
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
correct right so so I guess sort of
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
stepping back from yeah there's there's
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
all these sort of acute problems that
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
have developed over the last 50 60 years
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
with a lot of these co-ops what what's
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
the what's the
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
general what what's what's the
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
committee's feeling in in terms of how
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
we go about uh addressing this thing
 
02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
because at one point these were um you
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
know contracts between you know an
 
02:18:59.790 --> 02:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
agreement among towns that they all like
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
the terms of the agreement uh and and U
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know as I think a lot of people
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
probably know you know uh agreements
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
along with a lot of other things don't
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily age really really well and
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh and that's why a lot of agreements
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
have breakup terms and and stuff like
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
that in them and and unfortunately a lot
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
of these didn't have have have terms
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
deconstruct um but um you know what I I
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
I've I've I've heard some things in the
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
past like the general court doesn't
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
interfere with private contracts and
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
things like that and I don't know to
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
what extent these are considered to be
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
private contracts but clearly and I
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
agree with you Mr chair that something
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be needs to be done the the the
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
only thing I can sort of relate to um
 
02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
you know in a in a similar you know
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
similar situation affected a lot of
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
people is um is some work that the
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislature did several years back um
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh uh uh agreements in
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
um oh what do they call it um
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and and um and you know
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
call things cuz a lot of those did not
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
have standard I uh terms and conditions
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
or um and and and it was I remember it
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
was really frustrating and I was on
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
Commerce at the time because it's like
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
now the state is looking at interfering
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
with with with private contracts but
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
these things don't age well so the
 
02:20:38.110 --> 02:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
question is what I I there's one thing
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
about cleaning these little acute things
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
up piece by piece or setting something
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
that ends up being a a i I think that I
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
I hear where you're driving and I think
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
that's the frustration that we had and
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
that was what I think generated
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
represented cordell's Bill break them
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
all up and let's start over from scratch
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know it it's it's you know you look
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
at Whitefield and you look at their
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
ratio uh of you we were just talking
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
about it where it's 60% based upon ADM
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
and 40% on um uh awise valuation what
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
happens if property values are changing
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
but we're still at that 40% or the
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
population's changing but we're still at
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
that other ratio but then if we do
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
increase that that's it's it's what are
 
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
we going to do again in another 20 years
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
come around again you're going to have
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
acute problems again yeah
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
thanks so represent Damon represent
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
Tanner you next excuse me then represent
 
02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
Damon yeah thanks um
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess I was uh started teaching in
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
' 69 so karge had just formed as a
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
Cooperative so I remember a lot of the
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
haggling and waggling and everything
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
that went on and the fact that they did
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
put property Rich towns with property
 
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
not rich towns um
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
and I I think the kir Serge has gone
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
back several times and and redone their
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement um it seems from
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
sitting on this committee because this
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
comes up all the time that the that you
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
can pinpoint maybe five to 10
 
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
cooperatives in the state that are
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
knocking at the door all the time have
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
the same complaint all the time um with
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
one small town or the fact that you know
 
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative isn't working rather
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
than throwing the baby out with the bath
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
water uh because there is a an economy
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
of scale um and we've also talked about
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
how topheavy uh schools are with
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
Administration and this kind of co uh
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me puts the administration
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
together why don't we identify excuse me
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
those that are having problems and speak
 
02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
those that are having problems and speak
to

02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
those I think I got the gist there thank
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you I mean I don't know if
 
02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
there was so much a question in there if
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
that was directed to me representative
 
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
but I mean that's sort of one way to to
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
look at it as well too
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
um the other thing to um I don't know if
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is a problem but just sort of for
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
the historical background for members of
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
the committee um we see that um a lot of
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
the districts of co-ops were formed in
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
1963 1964 1965 it's my understanding
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
this is not don't take this as gospel
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
because I don't know for for certain but
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding is that the
 
02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education developed sort
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a template articles of agreement and
 
02:23:42.190 --> 02:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
then shipped it out to everybody and
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
then so there so you know there was a
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
tweak here and a tweak there but if you
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
were to look at it they all those that
 
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
were adopted from say 63 to about 66 or
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
68 they're all probably about 80%
 
02:23:54.910 --> 02:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
similar and then there were some local
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
changes here or there as well too so
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
sort of to represent of Luna's Point um
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
there's no Escape Clause there's no it's
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
not like we signed a prenup when we when
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
we enter this marriage right and say
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
upon dissolution of the Cooperative
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
School District we're going to have to
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
you know get it here or there now we're
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
trying to figure that out now 60 years
 
02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
into these contracts having been having
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
having having been in place I mean I do
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
like the idea representative chairman
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
lad you pointed to the the goral Goram
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
shelburn Randol language that you know
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
they have they have built in that will
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
review these every every five years you
 
02:24:33.269 --> 02:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
know statutory language I think I'd
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
probably go every 10 years just cuz if
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
you do it every five years you're going
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be doing it all the time then but I
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
think that's I don't think nhba would
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
have any particular objection to that
 
02:24:44.429 --> 02:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
and at the very least it's probably a
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
best practice anyway that you're looking
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
at your your your property tax rates
 
02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
your apportionment rates your your PO
 
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
your student population rates your town
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
population rates cuz those those could
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
be very different um and certainly
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
different than they are or were when
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
these articles of agreement were were
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
whatnot represent Damon then represent
 
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
Balon and then another hand I saw down
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
here thank you so I think um my one of
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
my two questions may have just been
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
answered but just to
 
02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:21.950 align:start position:0%
answered but just to
confirm

02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
so has there not previously been an
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
effort to put into statute a requirement
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
to revise or at least review and
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
possibly revise the Articles of
 
02:25:35.550 --> 02:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
agreement every X number of years has
 
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
that ever been attempted to put in
 
02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
statute we we've talk had a lot of talk
 
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
about this but I don't think we've ever
 
02:25:45.150 --> 02:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
had I don't think there's ever and
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's been concurrence on this idea
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
right but we've never gone forward with
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
something that we may start considering
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
and then I have a imped why not right I
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
think there were other issues which were
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
really surfacing we had you know uh uh
 
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
issues how people are getting elected to
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
the board um advisory budgets and all
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
that those kind of surface to the top
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
and this other one which snuck
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
underneath the radar the whole time we
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
never got to which I I think that's
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
something that we could handle and and
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
probably go forward with something uh
 
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
there were several other people first I
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
one more yes thank you so the other
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
question is also has there ever been an
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
effort to put into statute with actual
 
02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:32.950 align:start position:0%
effort to put into statute with actual
bill

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
proposed a cap excuse me a cap on the
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
per student responsibility and I don't
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
mean an actual dollar cap but in
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
proportion so when you look at like the
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh White Mountains District in the huge
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
disproportion between Carol and what the
 
02:26:52.269 --> 02:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
other towns pay has there ever been
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
effort to put in statute for all co-ops
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
we we do have the first bill on a doet
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
is $195 that's dealing with uh different
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
methods for
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment but take a look at linol
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
sir that that's for SE cost that's not
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was okay but if you look at like
 
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Woodstock which is a Cooperative
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
they don't a portion based upon ADM or
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
they do it just a percentage by Town
 
02:27:23.070 --> 02:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
yeah Lincoln has 65% Woodstock
 
02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
35% that's it and it wouldn't it
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't surprise me either if that's
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
reflective of the the student population
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
as well too I don't know but I'm just
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
saying it may you maybe 65% of the
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
population is from that town 35% is from
 
02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
the other town I I don't I didn't read
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
their their agreement on that but
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's some real issues up in
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
that particular Community with the value
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the ski areas and all that and equ
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
property valuation is you know high and
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that's and and some of the incomes
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
of those working at these Resorts is low
 
02:27:59.389 --> 02:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
and that there be it the
 
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
issue there were represent mil there was
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else represent Bon represent
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
Bon you had your hand up before
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
everybody up front
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
here uh thank you Mr chair it's actually
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
a kind of a wide question um when the
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
governor spoke at his State of the State
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
address and one of the things that um we
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
hear from the governor and the current
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
um education commissioner is that with
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
declining School enrollments that we
 
02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
need to be looking more at
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
consolidations and all we keep hearing
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
is about how people don't want to
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
consolidate so it seems like a just a
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
big philosophical issue in terms of
 
02:28:40.349 --> 02:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
where we're going here um and I don't I
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what kind of a
 
02:28:43.950 --> 02:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
question that is but well it's exactly
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
what Vermont went through the middle
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
this last weekend when they went forward
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
with their they've already had their
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
Town meetings school board meetings
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
onethird of all the towns in Vermont
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
voted down the school budget correct and
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
they're in the they're in the they're in
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
the mess because of they did this
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so-called consolidation yeah they they
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
Consolidated they're still finagling it
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
but was about maybe five years ago they
 
02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
went from I had the numbers somewhere
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I mean we know main tried
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
consolidation 15 16 years ago that that
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
didn't that didn't go well but
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
concurrently we had you know co-ops that
 
02:29:22.110 --> 02:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
were seeking to break up and the the
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
process for withdrawing from your school
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
Min review Into Your SAU is as easy as
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
can be I mean we have we have 20 more s
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
more than that I started an nhba in 2005
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
I believe we had 84 saus Littleton was
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the most recent withdraw we're up to
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
what 107 now if I'm not mistaken so more
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
than one a year and that's just the SAU
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
I get the the issues are different but
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know the the we're seeing the
 
02:29:49.950 --> 02:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
breaking apart in New Hampshire where
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
our neighbors were looking at
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
consolidation yeah that's well was
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
represent yeah represent LE then
 
02:29:58.399 --> 02:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
represent yeah represent LE then
represent

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
mybody so I guess my question is even if
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
we say we're going to look at these
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
every five years or every 10 years or
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
whatever we say we still have the issue
 
02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
of a big town controlling controlling it
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
and how do we deal with that I mean
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I mean I I
 
02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
know you're sort of putting that out
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
there almost philosophically and not a
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
direct answer I mean you know one of the
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know when we talked about some of
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
the voting bills and how the people are
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to be elected from from whatnot um
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
and I I forget the the representative's
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
name I believe she was from Hillsboro
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
Dearing and she talked about how Dearing
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
has 2,000 people Hillsboro has 4,000
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
people but yet the people over the 4,000
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
people in Hillsboro still get to vote
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the the Dearing rep as well too and
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you explained well too
 
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli we can make a
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
system where only the Dearing residents
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
vote for the Dearing rep and only the
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro people vote you know reps vote
 
02:31:00.269 --> 02:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
for the the but what you're still going
 
02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
to run into is because of the one man
 
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
one vote Provisions the bigger town is
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
going to have more Representatives than
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
the small town so you know that that's
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to be so whatever vote is before
 
02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
the the people or the election or the
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
warrant article or the
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's kind of you know that's the
 
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
nature of you know the nature of of of
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
is I think uh the last time we looked at
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
this systemically was the grure look and
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
that was what
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
2016 something like that 16 17 yeah
 
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
something like that that's in the packet
 
02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
that report it's in there and the
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
concern I guess I have
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
as we look at this as we look at the
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
multiple issues that have emerged just
 
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
this morning is you know we can try to
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
peac meal this thing
 
02:31:59.870 --> 02:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
together or we can try to have a more
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Global look at this because I do think
 
02:32:05.269 --> 02:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
that there the um conditions have
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
changed we we've mentioned several
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
student count uh a poron etc I know
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that would not trying to
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
kick the can down the road here but I
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
guess I'd rather kick kick it down the
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
road and get something substantive than
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
trying to continue to just Pac meal this
 
02:32:25.269 --> 02:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
thing together with some kind of a a
 
02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
commission or a group that could look at
 
02:32:29.309 --> 02:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
this and say okay let's look at the
 
02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
funding let's look at the governance
 
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
section of it let's look at the student
 
02:32:36.429 --> 02:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
population section and then the the
 
02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
charge to that group would be to come
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
back with some legislative
 
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations so that it would be a
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
full package looking at this rather than
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
just contining to do a little bit here a
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
little bit there not really addressing
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
the totality of it I mean I this clearly
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
is an issue that that needs to be
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
addressed and I just trying to figure
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
out figure out a way to look at this
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
from a systemic standpoint rather than
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
just from a peac meal standpoint so that
 
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
would be the concern that I would
 
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you in terms of uh a
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
length of time for reviewing the
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement um I'll just read
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
the the last uh sentence from um the
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
bill SB 353 in terms of reapportionment
 
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
um says reapportionment of members of
 
02:33:27.550 --> 02:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative School Board should be
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed revised and updated no less
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
frequently than every 10 years and
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
reapportioned if necessary based upon
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
the latest Federal Des Centennial census
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
and pursuant to several
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
rsas um so that was that but um in terms
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
of addressing the maybe the the
 
02:33:53.269 --> 02:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
districts that aren't happy um I'd be um
 
02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
actually I was thinking of this as an
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um back in uh 2022 when I
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
introduced it my but my dissolution and
 
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
repeal um of Cooperative school
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
districts I'd be very glad to upfront
 
02:34:08.429 --> 02:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
put in a common phrase if you like your
 
02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
Co-op you can keep it we've heard that
 
02:34:13.309 --> 02:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
phrase applied to many things before so
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to reintroduce it with that
 
02:34:15.439 --> 02:34:20.710 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to reintroduce it with that
Amendment

02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
2022 it was uh SB
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
353 and it was an amendment amendment
 
02:34:31.150 --> 02:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
number I think it's in your packet there
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
there is a rough draft of that amendment
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the packet I i' I've got copies of
 
02:34:38.910 --> 02:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
the actual Amendment and this this
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
helped generate what uh representative
 
02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
cordellia just mentioned and you'll see
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
the last sentence on the third page
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
there it does talk about uh the 10-year
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
reapportionment time frame and and Etc
 
02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
census okay were there other questions
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
on this right now this is just sort of
 
02:35:05.269 --> 02:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
just opening up these questions and
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
issues that are associated with co-ops
 
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just Laden with
 
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent oh% represent
 
02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:16.950 align:start position:0%
questions represent oh% represent
leus

02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
leus
 
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all of this just kind of I
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
started writing down a a maybe an idea
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
if um we take a vote in each Co-op town
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
by town and if all the towns in
 
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
particular Co-op are happy with it we're
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
done um if not they have a certain
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
time to come up to change whatever um to
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
try to come up with something that when
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
we take that vote
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
again if they all agree now cool they're
 
02:35:53.269 --> 02:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
done if they don't agree it gets
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
dissolved and we start
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
over just an idea that I was just
 
02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:00.429 align:start position:0%
over just an idea that I was just
thinking

02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
of represented
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
Amon thank you I'm going back a good bit
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
in this discussion because I just want
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
to make the observation that if one were
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
to replace co-ops or some
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
co-ops with
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
dissolve them in with tuition in the
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
students towns that tuition students
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:36:25.950 --> 02:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
representation on the school school
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
boards of those school districts they
 
02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:31.110 align:start position:0%
boards of those school districts they
have

02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:36:34.349 --> 02:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
basically um you're paying your tuition
 
02:36:37.550 --> 02:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
but you do not have any voting
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to influence what is
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
happening for your students even if all
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
community

02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recall do we have any
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
co-ops in
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
co-ops I mean yeah I mean you have one
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
you have one up in is that
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
Romney no and those up all the way up to
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
Campton Romney oh is that 48 and down
 
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
Co-op py Baker I think we have co-ops
 
02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
within coops well is I mean you have
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is a co-op isn't it isn't
 
02:37:18.990 --> 02:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
that's no no hail's uh was because he
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
had there were the two there were the
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
two districts within the town that's
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
right that's what Dairy is essentially
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
Dairy is a whole other weird animal that
 
02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how that I think that
 
02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
took an Act of the legislature to get
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
created if I'm not mistaken but when we
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
were dealing with Bridgewater last year
 
02:37:38.110 --> 02:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there is one up there that has
 
02:37:41.230 --> 02:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
oh no um they're tied to the southern
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
district there it's an there's there's a
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
couple co-ops in
 
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
sa35 which is like Bethlehem
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
profile um Lafayette Regional there's I
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
that I I without pulling up the
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education list there is a
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
co-op within a co-op yeah I think it's
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
may be the one in sa35 that you're
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of Mr chair
 
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay um further discussion maybe
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes there's a also a co-op Dresden which
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
is includes the town in yeah and that's
 
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
what messed up cuz they have norch
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
Vermont and norch takes their kids to
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
Hanover High School right that created a
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
nightmare in terms of when they were
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
mandated to be K through 12 in Vermont
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
right and nor is saying oh no no we're K
 
02:38:33.429 --> 02:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
through 12 in this relationship across
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
the river right with intergovernmental
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
District yeah and it just tore apart
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
state um okay I think what we ought to
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
do is look at Several of these bills
 
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
here and weighed through a couple of
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
them first the
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
1195 is a bill which relative allowing
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
school districts to approve different
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
apportionment methods for school
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
administrative units
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
saus which is a different
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
animal any discussion on that one right
 
02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:14.710 align:start position:0%
animal any discussion on that one right
now

02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
1195

02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes repent
 
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
B um thank you Mr chair it's uh my
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
district my
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
Sao uh so I know a little bit about it
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on there help out um
 
02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
they're not happy with the abortion
 
02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
methods being used and um I had inquired
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether they had tried to just talk
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
within the seu itself to try to get it
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
resolved and there seems to be some
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
question whether or not legally they can
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know it has not been
 
02:39:59.710 --> 02:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
brought up at the SAU level in terms of
 
02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:01.349 align:start position:0%
brought up at the SAU level in terms of
a

02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussion does is there anybody that
 
02:40:05.269 --> 02:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
needs some help in trying to Define what
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
organizationally represent Bon you had
 
02:40:15.309 --> 02:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
your not in this one that question but
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you you Mr chair um So based on
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
everything we were just talking about
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
for a while and understanding let me see
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
if this makes sense to anybody else
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
based on this bill so the potential
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
problem I'm seeing I don't know how this
 
02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
would actually play out in the real
 
02:40:33.790 --> 02:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
world but hypothetically anyway it seems
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a situation where we've
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
just heard that a number of you know
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
districts original districts within a
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District could be in a
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
position where the one town could get
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
more more sort of tilted over time
 
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
against it and it can't really do much
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
about it because the articles of
 
02:40:54.429 --> 02:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
agreement do not allow it to withdraw
 
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
unilaterally nor does New Hampshire law
 
02:40:59.469 --> 02:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
as of right now it seems to me that this
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
would actually have the potential to
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
make it considerably worse for them
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
because it would allow that same sort of
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
majority within the school board to vote
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
to change the apportionment method in
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
such a way that it could actually become
 
02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
worse for that town that's already
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
already being
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged um outside of the current
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement it's it's like
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're intervening in a way that could
 
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
really make this worse unless I'm unless
 
02:41:28.750 --> 02:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
something my the district which I'm in
 
02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:33.550 align:start position:0%
something my the district which I'm in
is

02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
sau23 it has within it the haal co-op
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
has Benton has bath has
 
02:41:42.429 --> 02:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
Pont uh
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
Warren and sau23 Co-op is saying we want
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
out because we feel we can educate our
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
kids cheaper but to get out then you
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
have the issue of who where are all the
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
buildings located for those others
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
they're all in
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
havil and and so they're locked in they
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
can't do that because they're going to
 
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
have to buy it all you know the cost of
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
all those other towns Benton bath which
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
is sizable and and uh Warren and and
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
permont uh so this is a real nightmare
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
how we've organized this entire State
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
co-ops yes represent tner I think one of
 
02:42:29.710 --> 02:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
the you know I agree we need a study
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee for this or a commission of
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
some type but I think we also can look
 
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
at some of the ones that have happened
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
and and what's been the major problem
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
like lster oan which was where Jim
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
Grenier was involved with and like you
 
02:42:46.269 --> 02:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
said it was a nightmare when they when
 
02:42:50.110 --> 02:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
they split up um and H how you know kind
 
02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:51.349 align:start position:0%
they split up um and H how you know kind
of

02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
a pathology report on it I guess uh I
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
would I would say to look at that as
 
02:43:02.349 --> 02:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
well as looking at the ones the the
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
commonalities between all the districts
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
that are having Pro all the co-ops that
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
are having problems it seems like you
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
know it's it's one small town that's
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
having an issue in most of of these and
 
02:43:18.429 --> 02:43:18.439 align:start position:0%
when we talked about Hein when Hein was
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
here and we had all that discussion the
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
the people at the
 
02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
SAU felt as though they weren't informed
 
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have an opportunity and
 
02:43:30.910 --> 02:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Bon you just
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
said that the district hadn't really
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
talked about it and so you know some of
 
02:43:40.269 --> 02:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
it is this this feeling that why don't
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
they get together and talk about it I
 
02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:43.110 align:start position:0%
they get together and talk about it I
mean

02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
what what's the what's the hold up with
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
that uh and why should
 
02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
we again Pander to somebody that just
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
comes here and doesn't even try to go
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
system the costs associated with the
 
02:44:02.670 --> 02:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
with an SAU they have an SAU
 
02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent and central office staff
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
basically which are maybe your special
 
02:44:08.429 --> 02:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
ed staff which go out to the various
 
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
districts within maybe you have
 
02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
Specialists going out too like a PE
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
teacher or a music teacher and those are
 
02:44:15.790 --> 02:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
all underneath
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
SAU budget and those towns have to pay
 
02:44:22.590 --> 02:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
into those those those costs which are
 
02:44:24.510 --> 02:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
established by the SAU and again those
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
towns maybe don't have the weight of the
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
vote to control much of that uh you
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
youve been familiar with this represent
 
02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:33.070 align:start position:0%
youve been familiar with this represent
cascaden

02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
cascaden
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
um um I'm familiar with area agreements
 
02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:37.710 align:start position:0%
um um I'm familiar with area agreements
yeah

02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
um not so much Cooperative agreements so
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're a little different like we said
 
02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
another animal another animal you can so
 
02:44:47.710 --> 02:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
you can you know you can
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
accept represent
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
Bon um as you said uh Theus are
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
different in terms of each Town owns
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
their own buildings they own their own
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
property they control their own schools
 
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we really share is
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
is I believe what this bill is trying to
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
get at is uh the uh what the services
 
02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
provided by the seu which has its own
 
02:45:11.790 --> 02:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
separate budget and the the
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
apportionment is that that is what goes
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
to pay for the seu bu you know what the
 
02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
the apportionment formula is like for
 
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
they have to pay is based on per pupil
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
or um it's the same one it's it's a
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
singular one that's that is in the
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
statute which is 50 it's based on a lot
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
of the co-op have it I believe it's the
 
02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
50% um um according to the valuation and
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and so are they looking to be able
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
to modify that statute from maybe 60 to
 
02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:45.830 align:start position:0%
to modify that statute from maybe 60 to
40

02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
40
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
or my understanding is because they they
 
02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
believe their property valuation is high
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and their student population is low it
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
means that again their their proportion
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
they believe is higher than it should be
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
and because co-ops have the ability to
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
do it saus do not it's only a singular
 
02:46:05.469 --> 02:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
Statute in the SAU I think that's what
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the issue is yeah okay that that helps
 
02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:09.309 align:start position:0%
the issue is yeah okay that that helps
Define

02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
Define
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
it want to go on to the next bill okay
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
let's go on to the next one here which
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
is uh 1383 relative to
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
elections

02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
1383

02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
this is addressing some of that
 
02:47:00.269 --> 02:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had earlier today where
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
they get elected by their own District
 
02:47:06.429 --> 02:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
um could I hand out that previous we had
 
02:47:10.349 --> 02:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
these are these are copies of that
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
2002 uh
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that uh
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad and I worked on with
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Lichfield who used
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be a member of this committee who
 
02:47:24.750 --> 02:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
brought the original Bill forward and
 
02:47:31.389 --> 02:47:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
Means maybe we when everybody gets this
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we just take an opportunity to
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
walk through this one right here this
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment because it does address some
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the issues which are coming up in
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
these bills which we're
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:55.910 align:start position:0%
these bills which we're
seeing

02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
do you want to walk people through this
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli okay uh
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
um uh first of all on um the middle of
 
02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:07.110 align:start position:0%
um uh first of all on um the middle of
page

02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:48:12.269 --> 02:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
one um it uh goes over what the um
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
existing options are and we
 
02:48:20.269 --> 02:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
removed that uh provision that all
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
members shall be elected at
 
02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
large um we were trying to get away from
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
at large members and move as you see in
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page to
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment um by uh
 
02:48:39.870 --> 02:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
town of
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh proportional number of
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives so I think in my
 
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
district we looked at something to the
 
02:48:49.469 --> 02:48:49.479 align:start position:0%
effect that wolfboro would have four
 
02:48:52.110 --> 02:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
repres maybe wolfboro would have three
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh toughen Boro 2 and
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the the other four towns
 
02:48:59.790 --> 02:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
would have one so it would be a
 
02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:00.990 align:start position:0%
would have one so it would be a
proportional

02:49:00.990 --> 02:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.279 --> 02:49:10.429 align:start position:0%
 
population

02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
um um and you see that uh on over on P
 
02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:15.750 align:start position:0%
um um and you see that uh on over on P
page

02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
two um it would require a transition
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
plan and a staggering so that you know
 
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
if you're if you were one of the atlarge
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
members and your term lasted for another
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
two terms you're not going to be kicked
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
off the board um so it was a a
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
transitional plan uh to move to the
 
02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:38.070 align:start position:0%
transitional plan uh to move to the
proportional

02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
02:49:40.229 --> 02:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
representation um and then down at the
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
bottom was the um review every 10 years
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
things could be adjusted for population
 
02:49:49.630 --> 02:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
with with the
 
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
main yes represent luno
 
02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks but but didn't um didn't a a
 
02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last year or the year
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
before face a
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
um uh face an issue with the sort of one
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
person one vote type of type of thing
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
because you've got a um a voting
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
district and
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
then if you don't have everybody in the
 
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
district being able to vote on all the
 
02:50:27.389 --> 02:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
people who are running for school board
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
then you you ran a foul of other state
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
laws wasn't there something about
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
possibly about that but but in here you
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
would you would just vote on the members
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
from your town right but but that I
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly what the so the the
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
problem I think arose around where
 
02:50:48.269 --> 02:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
you've got here in Roman 3 um which
 
02:50:50.349 --> 02:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
she'll be elected within their own
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
District so
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:02.590 --> 02:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
district there there is there were those
 
02:51:05.150 --> 02:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
that were oppositional to represent Norm
 
02:51:08.229 --> 02:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
major was not too excited by this uh
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
seeing his community was would which is
 
02:51:13.309 --> 02:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
basically controlling
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
now uh would lose some of that ability
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
to control the coop they had a number of
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
at large members that's right what was
 
02:51:27.630 --> 02:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
the disposition of this bill yeah and
 
02:51:29.389 --> 02:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
pardon me in 22
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
22 what was the disposition of this bill
 
02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't it itl it it did not move forward
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if it was sted or it's
 
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
just and when and when you're talking
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
about the districts like in in uh make
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
in in 1383 talking about the the
 
02:51:53.389 --> 02:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
um the pre-existing District that is now
 
02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
a member of the
 
02:51:57.790 --> 02:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
co-op it's not the co-op District right
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
right it's the pre-existing District so
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the town so to speak right yes um
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where where the where
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the um the challenge was because the
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the voting district is actually the
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
the the the what what's it called the
 
02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:23.429 align:start position:0%
the the the what what's it called the
political

02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
body yes you're talking about the
 
02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
governance of the co-op is that's a
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
separate entity right and then but you
 
02:52:31.950 --> 02:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
have districts which are participants
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
within that the pre-existing districts
 
02:52:36.110 --> 02:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
pre-existing those towns which came in
 
02:52:38.110 --> 02:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
and joined this Co-op but when they
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
joined the co-op the district the
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts no longer exist
 
02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
and that the and I see I see Barrett
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
nodding on that the co-op district is
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision not the
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
pre-existing so it becomes a a a the
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts no longer have
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision status to conduct
 
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
an election I I think that's what
 
02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
the what the what the what how the
 
02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:11.479 align:start position:0%
discussion went on how Bill 1646 back in
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
2022 right but they they have they have
 
02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
elections now Effingham has an election
 
02:53:21.030 --> 02:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh tomorrow but the the problem is or
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
the issue is the fact that um the other
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
five towns can who rep can vote on who
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
the Effingham representative is no no I
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
think we're saying the same thing that
 
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that that all the members the
 
02:53:35.229 --> 02:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
voting district is the co-op District
 
02:53:38.229 --> 02:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
not the not the town of Effingham when
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
it comes to members on a on a qu on a
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
subdiv political subdivision School
 
02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:51.630 align:start position:0%
subdiv political subdivision School
Board

02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
what's

02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
what's
 
02:53:55.710 --> 02:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
that sorry go ahead so if I'm
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
understanding you correctly that would
 
02:54:02.830 --> 02:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
be requiring all the co-op board members
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
to be elected at large which is not what
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
happens now
 
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
right I think but the question is that
 
02:54:14.670 --> 02:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
David was relating to is that there when
 
02:54:18.750 --> 02:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
these co-ops were created there was some
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
reason why all members of a co-op board
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
elected how that process my presumption
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
is that there was some some um
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
legal basis for how they currently were
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
recommended on how they should be
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
elected I would right but each articles
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
of agreement defines it
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
differently right but I think I I think
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
this goes more more to a a um I don't
 
02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
know what you call it you know this is
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
an election law but sort of uh you know
 
02:54:57.429 --> 02:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
it it goes to election law or
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
representation but but for example for
 
02:55:04.110 --> 02:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
for all the people in our um represented
 
02:55:05.790 --> 02:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know the districts we
 
02:55:10.269 --> 02:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
represent um there's not some
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
that how do I how do you how do you say
 
02:55:14.429 --> 02:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
it you I mean we all have different
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of constituents in our districts
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
depending upon how many representatives
 
02:55:23.710 --> 02:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
you are in the district but you you
 
02:55:28.830 --> 02:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't have um a representative that has
 
02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
a e you know either represents a smaller
 
02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
number or a larger number it's within
 
02:55:36.670 --> 02:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
the voting district you all vote the
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
represent the same like there's four of
 
02:55:41.710 --> 02:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
us in the hopkington boow district um
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
Muriel Angela Mel and me we all
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
represent the same number of of
 
02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and what you'd have here is
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
in Roman 3 I believe is you'd have
 
02:55:57.630 --> 02:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard representatives of a of the
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
co-op subdivision District that some
 
02:56:03.389 --> 02:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
would be representing 300 voters some
 
02:56:07.150 --> 02:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
would be representing 3,000 voters and
 
02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
and so it gives you a disproportional
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
voice as a as a voter if uh you know if
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
you're from a small town
 
02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
and that and you're and you're you get a
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
seat on the district it's just a
 
02:56:23.790 --> 02:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
disproportional I mean it just I think
 
02:56:26.229 --> 02:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
it I think it spills into election law
 
02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
is is what I recall the the the the
 
02:56:33.150 --> 02:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
challenge that we faced a couple years
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
ago so
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
Damon I don't know if this makes sense
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
or not but it occurs to me that there
 
02:56:44.710 --> 02:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
could be a parallel to our Federal
 
02:56:47.710 --> 02:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
representation that every state has two
 
02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
senators regardless of the population of
 
02:56:52.990 --> 02:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
the state and has a designated number of
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives that is based on the
 
02:56:56.110 --> 02:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
population of the
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
state so in a way that's what the model
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
for the co-ops that have some members at
 
02:57:04.429 --> 02:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
large and some by town it's sort of the
 
02:57:06.190 --> 02:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
same as that now you're are you seeing
 
02:57:09.309 --> 02:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
why you have Barrett Christina saying
 
02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
study uh
 
02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
it it's a really heady topic and every
 
02:57:19.469 --> 02:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
time you go somewhere the the rabbit
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
hole gets
 
02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
hole gets
deeper

02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
deeper
 
02:57:26.349 --> 02:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh so special Commission on education
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
and there may be some things in here
 
02:57:30.349 --> 02:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with advisory Council for
 
02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
budget and all that which we can address
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
but the overall structure of this thing
 
02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
is very complex represent
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
belard thank you Mr chair I was just
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to offer a little bit of a
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
different view on the the issue of
 
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
representation and again I'm not an
 
02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
election law exper iser but I think the
 
02:57:50.309 --> 02:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
most fundamental election principle that
 
02:57:52.510 --> 02:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
I know of is the principle that no
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
taxation without representation and as
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
it stands right now it seems to me that
 
02:58:00.030 --> 02:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
if it's true that we have towns that are
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
voting overwhelmingly for you know
 
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
person X to go represent them in this
 
02:58:06.510 --> 02:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
body yet they're being overruled by you
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
know another town who's voting for
 
02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
person why it doesn't seem like we have
 
02:58:13.229 --> 02:58:13.239 align:start position:0%
an issue where they're going to receive
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
disproportionate representation it seems
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
like we currently have an issue where
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
they have zero
 
02:58:20.830 --> 02:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
representation uh and that that that
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
seems like the exact opposite of what we
 
02:58:24.229 --> 02:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
would want to be doing
 
02:58:28.349 --> 02:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
here Mr chair yes I mean no they're
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
they're not they their candidate may not
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
have been elected but they got to vote
 
02:58:35.630 --> 02:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
on candidates that were running and the
 
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
people who were elected represent all
 
02:58:42.510 --> 02:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
the constituents in all of the the towns
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
that comprise the co-ops they do have
 
02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
representation it just might not be
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
their neighbor and I'm not disagree I'm
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
not saying that that's right or wrong
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that I think that's where
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's where I think the the conflict
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
was in maybe other parts of election law
 
02:59:01.389 --> 02:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
that that we have and what
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
representative Damon talks about with us
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's obviously Federal and we we've I
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
think all heard arguments about about
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
you know you know you know New Hampshire
 
02:59:13.950 --> 02:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
having a disproportionately large
 
02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
representation in the um in the US
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
Senate compared to say on a per what we
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
got to do in about 5 minutes going to
 
02:59:21.309 --> 02:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
break this thing down or a couple
 
02:59:23.550 --> 02:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
minutes here uh represent cordelli is
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
going to direct you right now to profile
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is up uh in uh Franconia area right
 
02:59:31.750 --> 02:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
there there shall be seven members of
 
02:59:34.030 --> 02:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
the school board for the profile um
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
Co-op four members of the
 
02:59:39.870 --> 02:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
profile four members of the profile
 
02:59:41.429 --> 02:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
School Board should be elected by the
 
02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
voters of
 
02:59:46.349 --> 02:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem three members shall be elected
 
02:59:47.950 --> 02:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
by the voters of
 
02:59:51.150 --> 02:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
Lafayette so they are electing people
 
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
from their own town in that
 
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
case so that's what we were looking for
 
02:59:59.590 --> 02:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
with s SP
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
323 and that was proportional four four
 
03:00:02.439 --> 03:00:05.229 align:start position:0%
323 and that was proportional four four
to

03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
three okay is are there need for any
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this this has just
 
03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
been an intro to Cooperative School
 
03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
boards and you're walking up probably
 
03:00:17.469 --> 03:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
more confused now than you've ever been
 
03:00:21.550 --> 03:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh however um we have six bills here are
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
so in front of us that are we're going
 
03:00:24.910 --> 03:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with issues associated
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
with the structure of school
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
districts co-ops in this state um I I
 
03:00:32.830 --> 03:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
advise you know folks to try and read
 
03:00:34.510 --> 03:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
these bills before we come up and we're
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
not going to be dealing with them today
 
03:00:39.309 --> 03:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh but we will be within what I think
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
that they come up on Wednesday is it on
 
03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
that they come up on Wednesday is it on
Wednesday

03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
so uh I've asked several of the sponsors
 
03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
to be here I know representative
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
spillsbury is here on one of them he'll
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
be here he's didn't come in today but he
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
will be here when he came in a little
 
03:00:58.910 --> 03:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
earlier today we talked with him uh but
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors will be here so when
 
03:01:02.229 --> 03:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this I'd like to
 
03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
have during that time we're discussing
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bills to maybe they can bring up
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
provide us a little bit more insight as
 
03:01:12.229 --> 03:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
to what's going and what generated that
 
03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
particular bill right R now so with that
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
let's take take a break right now and
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at 1:00 right do you
 
03:01:24.229 --> 03:01:24.239 align:start position:0%

caucus before 1:00 um well we could
 
03:01:31.229 --> 03:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
always caucus at one o' and it just take
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:05:42.269 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.279 --> 03:28:10.269 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.279 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:48:08.469 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:08.479 align:start position:0%

e

03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.479 --> 04:15:36.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.040 --> 04:27:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.960 --> 04:35:30.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
going forward with these bills we have
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
an ad doet for uh representa clud
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%

weigh down through these there um there
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
are some which we will not be discussing
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
today and so the first bill 1015 we're
 
04:35:53.709 --> 04:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
waiting for an amendment on that bill
 
04:35:57.551 --> 04:35:57.561 align:start position:0%
dealing with the date change so uh we
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
won't be discussing that today we'll do
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
a quickly the subsequent day um jumping
 
04:36:05.709 --> 04:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
down here uh 148
 
04:36:08.429 --> 04:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
we've done that that's been exec this
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
came over as REM as a result we had to
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
get the list of bills over to upstairs
 
04:36:16.230 --> 04:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
by noon on that Wednesday and we did
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
some of these execs in the afternoon and
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
so we just said pile them all in on the
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
next go around and so that's what's been
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
done there
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
1450 um I got a mending language
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
provided to me yesterday from the
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
chancellor of the University system

04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with the higher education and
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%

state of New
 
04:36:51.310 --> 04:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1450 so that won't be today
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
either uh
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
1458 we've done
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
that uh previously and the last one 1646
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
also so that leaves for today who
 
04:37:05.799 --> 04:37:07.470 align:start position:0%
also so that leaves for today who
together

04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%

1087
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%

04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
that happens if that happens to be one
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
of them represent cordel you'd be the
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
speaking person because you made the
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
motion okay thank you Mr chair you're
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
welcome this topic is very important to
 
04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%
me of information
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
literacy uh I actually wrote a book
 
04:38:31.470 --> 04:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
about it for college students so um
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to speak on it now I
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure you're clear that I
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
think it's very important and what is it
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
really fundamentally but learning how to
 
04:38:42.719 --> 04:38:44.910 align:start position:0%
really fundamentally but learning how to
discern

04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
discern
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
truth so my opposition to this bill has
 
04:38:50.750 --> 04:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the purpose of this
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
commission but with the commission
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
itself and its
 
04:38:54.199 --> 04:38:56.269 align:start position:0%
itself and its
makeup

04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
I I had heard there might be an
 
04:39:01.869 --> 04:39:01.879 align:start position:0%
amendment but that's I'm we're just
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
going with this bill that's here that uh
 
04:39:05.639 --> 04:39:07.150 align:start position:0%
going with this bill that's here that uh
for

04:39:07.150 --> 04:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
instance I feel like some of the members
 
04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
of this committee would have a political
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
bias I also feel like the legislative
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
mission that comes out in lines three on
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
page two and line uh 10 about
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh makes it a bit too
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
political and when you start getting
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
political you start having a bias which
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
takes away from mission of discerning
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
truth so um and I have a spefic specific
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
problem with the current bill naming on
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
line 13 a member of Media power youth uh
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
you can learn a lot about organizations
 
04:39:45.070 --> 04:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
just going to their website and I won't
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
get into the details but there is a
 
04:39:48.990 --> 04:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
political agenda to that group as there
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
is to the New Hampshire school library
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
media Association I did look at their
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
website last night and there are many
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
links to Ala American Library
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
Association material uh and there is no
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
denying that the American Library
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
Association does have a political agenda
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
and so those are my main
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
objections uh I think that is
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
all I had to say on it I also think we
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
have to be real careful it it does seem
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
like we have a lot of bills asking for a
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
commission on this and a commission on
 
04:40:19.948 --> 04:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to be careful with
 
04:40:22.270 --> 04:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
sort of reing that in a little thank you
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli do you you made the
 
04:40:27.070 --> 04:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
the second nothing thank
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.280 --> 04:40:33.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:40:33.788 --> 04:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:33.798 --> 04:40:36.830 align:start position:0%
um
me

04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
you would like to speak right now
 
04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
represent yeah go ahead thank you Mr
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
chair first of all I'd like to say that
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill was developed um for
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
positive reason not a political reason
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
and it was brought up because we've had
 
04:41:00.750 --> 04:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of um discussion debate over
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
media what what is in libraries and this
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
was a bill that would hope make the
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
Librarians and the libraries and the
 
04:41:13.150 --> 04:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
media people um having a commission uh
 
04:41:15.628 --> 04:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
looking at what's happening developing
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
uh processes in the future um it was
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be a positive thing not a
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
political thing and um we have an
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for it that I'd like to
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
just say that it speaks to the two
 
04:41:32.190 --> 04:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
issues that was were brought up in
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
committee before one about it takes
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
removes the media power youth
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
um reference in the in the uh Bill and
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
it also adds um what I believe
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative dry added uh which was to
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the uh report go to the chair of
 
04:41:54.430 --> 04:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the chair of the house so
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%

04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
we heard the first time around and asked
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
that um something that could be positive
 
04:42:07.948 --> 04:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
and could include a lot of people and U
 
04:42:09.868 --> 04:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the issues that have
 
04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%

of simplifies things a little bit uh it

removes the objection which was the uh
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
Media power youth
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh notice in it and also it includes uh
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that the bill uh the result of the
 
04:45:27.868 --> 04:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
commission's finding should go to the
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the president
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%

04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
and um as I said before it's it's
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
something that we could do that's
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
positive which we don't often get a
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%

swinging so I appreciate that this was

04:46:09.868 --> 04:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
specific Media power Youth Organization
 
04:46:11.470 --> 04:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
I can't recall when during the hearing I
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
think it was mentioned some somewhere if
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else can remember that this is
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
the only organization right now that
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
fulfills the requirement as now put
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
forth there on line 18 of the amendment
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
but my concern again is just getting an
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
organization a nonprofit organization it
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
seems like anytime most most
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
organizations today do have a political
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
agenda so whether that would be on
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
either side of the eye I believe that
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
brings a bias into this commission and a
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
bi with a bias comes that um problem of
 
04:46:43.470 --> 04:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
sort of compromising on the mission of
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
discerning truth I just wanted to
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
mention that since you did address my
 
04:46:48.480 --> 04:46:51.350 align:start position:0%
mention that since you did address my
objection

04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
objection
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay doesn't look like we' have have any
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
more hands up
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
so i' just like to ask the question I
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
see your hand up I'd like to ask the
 
04:47:01.708 --> 04:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
question that you kind of implied um
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
which was are there other me media
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
literacy organizations that serve youth
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
organizations can anybody answer that
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
question representative McDonald it was
 
04:47:19.230 --> 04:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
said in testimony by Media power youth
 
04:47:20.548 --> 04:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
that at this time they're the only
 
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
organization that meets a
 
04:47:23.320 --> 04:47:24.948 align:start position:0%
organization that meets a
requirement

04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any further hands for
 
04:47:31.470 --> 04:47:31.480 align:start position:0%

recommendation here yes and um so
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner you'll be writing
 
04:49:51.548 --> 04:49:51.558 align:start position:0%
that OTP and you'll be writing the itl
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you OT yeah yeah otpa down there
 
04:49:55.600 --> 04:49:56.948 align:start position:0%
thank you OT yeah yeah otpa down there

04:50:04.548 --> 04:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
so take a break
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we're going to take a break here
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.990 --> 04:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
minutes caucus break am I pronouncing
 
04:50:15.548 --> 04:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
your name correctly
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
actually I might have done it different
 
04:50:25.548 --> 04:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:28.110 --> 04:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
too so what is
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
CL cler
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
okay I just know it's important to
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
people yeah John's been around a while
 
04:50:41.040 --> 04:51:02.830 align:start position:0%
people yeah John's been around a while
John

04:51:02.830 --> 04:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.840 --> 04:56:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
cluer

04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.000 --> 04:56:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
are

04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.360 --> 04:56:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
me

04:56:36.990 --> 04:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay so we're now addressing 1287 this
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
is a relative the definition of the term
 
04:56:44.830 --> 04:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
evidencebased within public education
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
represent beler you're recognized for a
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I would move
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
off to
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second I'm a second
 
04:56:55.868 --> 04:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
represent Lin seconds that
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
motion so beler
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
leus representative beler recognized as
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
the prime SP or maker of the motion
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and we've discussed
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
this quite a lot so I won't belabor the
 
04:57:08.910 --> 04:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
points I'll I'll just say that the the
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
idea of this bill is really to just to
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
differentiate between what represents
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
good science versus less good science to
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're con consistently
 
04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
moving the direction of improvement and
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
reading out things that are not actually
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
properly supported by evidence the bill
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
places no burden on teachers because it
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
is not to be enforced on teachers or in
 
04:57:31.750 --> 04:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
an individual classroom it is only for
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
those parties who are adopting methods
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
of education and in that it also doesn't
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
apply to curriculum so it's not about
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
what is taught but it's about how things
 
04:57:41.948 --> 04:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
are taught and I think we could benefit
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
greatly by taking a more science-based
 
04:57:46.548 --> 04:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
approach thank you is there any
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.548 --> 04:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
second I just say wanted to say that my
 
04:57:55.628 --> 04:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
dad being a physicist brought me up in
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
this and so I have too many times uh
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
seen people not following this CU they
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
don't really understand scientific
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
method and I was thrilled to see this
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill because this is closer to the
 
04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
scientific method thank
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else wants to speak
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
against repres
 
04:58:24.868 --> 04:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
luno thanks very much Mr chair so um I'm
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
I'm disappointed that the motion coming
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
out of this committee would be ought to
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
pass to essentially turn science on its
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
head but I guess i' i' have to say I'm
 
04:58:38.110 --> 04:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
not surprised because um seems
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
like half the members on this committee
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
feel that public schools are
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
failing they feel
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
that schools are not doing the job that
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
they're intended to do ref luno I I do
 
04:58:55.948 --> 04:58:55.958 align:start position:0%
not believe that people feel that
 
04:58:55.958 --> 04:58:57.190 align:start position:0%
not believe that people feel that
everything's

04:58:57.190 --> 04:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
everything's
 
04:58:59.390 --> 04:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
failing okay well we've heard certainly
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
heard thank you and and I apologize Mr
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
chair but we've heard a number of times
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
um statements like that made but we
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
didn't hear that made by the governor
 
04:59:12.910 --> 04:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
during his State of the State speech
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
when he said New Hampshire New
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools are doing a
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
great job in fact they're number two as
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
far as student outcomes um uh across the
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
country and it it just it it it bothers
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
me so much that
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
that while New Hampshire public
 
04:59:37.150 --> 04:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
04:59:39.948 --> 04:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
doing a tremendous job as far as
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
delivering student outcomes I know it's
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
not happening everywhere and I know
 
04:59:46.270 --> 04:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
that's we I think we all understand that
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
there's a number of reasons for that
 
04:59:52.230 --> 04:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
that that that by and large because of
 
04:59:54.910 --> 04:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
our policies and because of the support
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um that public schools have from
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
from our public taxpayers that um that
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that bred Staters put a
 
05:00:06.510 --> 05:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
priority on student outcomes in public
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
education why we would want to
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
change how we look
 
05:00:13.280 --> 05:00:14.788 align:start position:0%
change how we look
at

05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
science and turn it on its head doesn't
 
05:00:20.590 --> 05:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me and and why would
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
we want to break something that's
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
working so well and doing so much good
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
state I I can I can certainly
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
think of reasons
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
why maybe stuff like this comes up but I
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
can't believe that that that that that's
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of public schools
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
or our families or our kids or our
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
economy so for that and for so many
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
other reasons I think for at least these
 
05:00:55.390 --> 05:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I would be voting against the um
 
05:00:59.230 --> 05:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass and um and hopefully
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know we we'd be able to um to defeat
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
this um this this this bill which um I I
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
would would certainly appear to
 
05:01:13.708 --> 05:01:13.718 align:start position:0%
undermine um evidence and facts used in
 
05:01:15.990 --> 05:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
public schools today thanks thank thank
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%

by representative
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
mcdonal represent
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
leus yes first off um going down through
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
this bill I really don't understand what
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
we have against having a
 
05:04:43.150 --> 05:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization in
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
education I would think a for-profit
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
organization would do it would be much
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
more responsive to the students who are
 
05:04:52.958 --> 05:04:54.868 align:start position:0%
more responsive to the students who are
their

05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
um who are the ones using their system
 
05:05:02.190 --> 05:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
and more likely to pay for so that's the
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
first part of it I don't understand why
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
we have to only be nonprofit and the
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
second part
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
is all schools everybody already needs
 
05:05:15.628 --> 05:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
to follow all applicable state and
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
federal anti-discrimination laws it's
 
05:05:20.548 --> 05:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
already in there I don't know why that's
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
in there either
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
so and I do have a question what on
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
Earth accreditation standards do
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
for-profits not have regarding you know
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
that what what was the point of this
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill to begin
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
with thank you very much from the second
 
05:05:41.548 --> 05:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
well said thank
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody that wants
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
chair so I think there's numerous
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
examples probably too many to even
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
discuss of uh for-profit Institutes of
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
higher education uh and the disservice
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
they do to their students the uh the the
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
really abysmal um uh completion rates
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
that they see and the uh leaving
 
05:06:09.190 --> 05:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
students with enormous death debts far
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
exceeding those in um in um um in
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or public um U institutes so
 
05:06:20.430 --> 05:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
so I one of the things New Hampshire I
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
think has has has been able to fend off
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
so far is um is for-profit institutions
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
none have so far been um been been
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
approved uh for and given degree Grant
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
granting Authority in the um in the
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
granite state and so uh so this statute
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
seeks to keep it that way um it also um
 
05:06:44.110 --> 05:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh does uh does another thing that I
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
think is very significant and um uh and
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
and something that's that's actually
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily common among nonprofit
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
um uh Institutes of higher education
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is compliance with the Higher
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
Education Act of 1965 and so this is a
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
federal civil rights act um uh that uh
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
that just
 
05:07:12.430 --> 05:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
about every nonprofit Institute of
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
higher education across the country uh
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh endorses and Embraces uh I think um
 
05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh just a few years ago uh we
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
received a report from um from our
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
committee researcher Miss for um with
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
regards to the number of institutes that
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
did not and you could count them I think
 
05:07:36.990 --> 05:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
on one hand uh that uh that that did not
 
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
accept um that did not comply with the
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
higher education act so um so so and
 
05:07:46.708 --> 05:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
then of course it also puts into statute
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
under um under degree granting Authority
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the section that applies to to what
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
the standard is for that that um that
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
these um institutes also need to comply
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
with state and federal
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws what that may
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
be in law already but the fact that we
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
have it here and the fact that we add
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Higher Education Act
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we codify the
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to be nonprofit I
 
05:08:16.030 --> 05:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
think sets a sets a very reasonable hard
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
deck for um for approval of these uh
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
colleges for degree granting Authority
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
