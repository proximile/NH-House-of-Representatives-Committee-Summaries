our rate of job growth exceeds the
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
national average and is the best in New

see our prudent financially responsible
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
approach to taxes and regulations and
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
our commitment to protecting our unique
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
quality of life has made us a prime
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
destination in the region in the
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
competition for
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
talent as individuals assess their
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
opportunities and families look at the
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
the cost and quality of life New
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is seen as a
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
destination where you can re realize
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
your full
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
potential what we've created over these
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
last number of years is special
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
and all of New Hampshire is benefiting
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
from it this success does not come
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
without new
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
challenges like increasing our housing
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
Supply or having a best-in-class
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
education system or keeping up with the
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
demand for our
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
services but I believe together we can
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
meet these challenges head
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
on when I stood here a month ago I
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
shared with you the necessity for us to
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
recalibrate I told you that we must
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
operate within our means and meet our
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
commitments to those who are depending
 
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.830 align:start position:0%
commitments to those who are depending
on

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
us and for the past number of years our
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
budgets have been bolstered by billions
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
of dollars from the federal government
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
due to the covid
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic we've also seen High revenues
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
that made it easy to engage in Surplus
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
spending in new areas
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
our last budget saw a
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
21% spending increase in general funds
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
over a two-year period not to say
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
anything of the off-budget spending that
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
occurred as well the simple fact is that
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
our Revenue landscape looks different
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
from that of the past number of years
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
with Federal transfers dropping and
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
revenues lower lower
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
overall a recalibration of our approach
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
order both for the total amount of
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
spending and also for how we Steward
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
every single taxpayer
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
dollar the state of New Hampshire is
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
strongest when we as individuals
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
families and small businesses have more
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
money in our pockets that's something
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
that our friends on the other side of
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
the strength of our state lies in the
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
individual in those that create the job
 
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.789 align:start position:0%
individual in those that create the job
job

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for others that isn't the
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
role of
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
government furthermore the answer to our
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
challenges is not to take more from our
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
citizens in the way of taxes but rather
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
to look carefully and thoughtfully what
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
what at what we're doing as a
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
state ask if we need to be doing it ask
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
if we can afford to continue doing it
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
much of what we accomplish best in our
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
state is done at the local level and
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we are pushing more funds
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
than ever to the local level and it's
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
why I also challenge our local officials
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
to take the same stance we do as a State
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
and to take a hard look at what they're
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
level thank

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
you when we're sending more monies money
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
down locally I would hope that our local
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
officials would accordingly pass on
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
property Le relief tax relief whenever
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's possible in building this budget
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
our guiding principle has been to
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
deliver a budget worthy of our people
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
that represents a re-calibration of the
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
way we do business while continuing our
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way of not raising taxes
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
but instead taking a hard look at
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
spending we have a constitutional
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to deliver a balanced
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
budget for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
we rolled up our sleeves to find savings
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
to meet this mandate and our
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners work diligently alongside
 
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.070 align:start position:0%

of
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
us in comparison to our last budget we
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
are spending $150 million less in
 
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.780 align:start position:0%
general funds in this budget
 
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
general funds in this budget

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
this adjustment in general funds was
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
undertaken smartly and thoughtfully with
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
a scalpel not a shovel it does so
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
without across theboard cuts and
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
prioritizing those who are depending on
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
the services provided by the state we we
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
focused on making our government more
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
efficient and ensuring that tax dollars
 
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
do more with
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
less we cut bloated contracts from out
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
of state vendors we took a hard look at
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
how our agencies operate and we worked
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
with our commissioners to dial in
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
spending we also found areas to make
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
responsible adjustments that bring us in
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
line with the times and we followed What
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
other states are doing as well as well
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
we brought our Medicaid Eligibility back
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
in line with prepandemic levels and
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
joined our neighbors in requiring
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
nominal co-pays for some of those
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
receiving those
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
benefits I'd like to thank our
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners for their diligence in
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
working through this process and their
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
openness to considering new ideas and
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
approaches to our
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
work those who depend on the services of
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
can rest assured that this budget will
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
deliver for
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
them Rising costs are a problem for
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
everyone and we heard loud and clear the
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
need to help our local communities meet

Weighing on the economic success of our
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
than the housing market and the
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
challenges we're facing there Supply is
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
tight demand is high and inventory is
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
expensive our economic success hinges on
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
our ability to attack attract talent and
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
given the great story we have to tell
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
we're succeeding people are coming but
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
they need an affordable place to live in
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we also need to com combat
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
this affordability crisis is so that our
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
kids stay so that our retirees stay so
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
that our communities keep old faces and
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
welcome new
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
faces our job growth leads the region
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
but today home listings are half their
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels and rentals are
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
extremely tight not to mention higher
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
home prices rents mortgage rates all of
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
which has gone
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
up and it makes it even harder
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that the first step we can
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
take as a state to help our housing
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
market is to be good models of the
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
change that we would like to
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
see this starts with streamlining our
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
permitting process to get Builders
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
answers faster so that the projects are
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
not unnecessarily hung up in
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy which is why I'm announcing
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
a plan to streamline the permitting
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
process to ensure that it takes no more
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
than 60 days and puts the burden on the
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
state to meet this timeline or to
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
Forfeit the right to
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
act this is a first step in ensuring
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
that we are a good actor as a state and
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
it sets a model for local communities to
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
follow as we respond to the critical
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
housing shortage that we face as a state
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
but let me be clear about something we
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
aren't going to meaningfully address
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
prices or loosen our supply unless our
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
local communities are coming to the
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
table and recognize the role that each
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
of those communities also played in our
 
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.589 align:start position:0%
of those communities also played in our
shared

00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
shared
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
success what we have
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it's working but we need to
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
all work together on this housing issue
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's more supply
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
for our
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
state the more we can share what we're
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
doing in New Hampshire the more it is
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
good for our state and for our people
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to understand what
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing well as a state in the
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
context of our
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
neighbors and as I said early earlier
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
our job growth leads the
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
region and it's our ability to attract
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
talent to our state that is really to
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
thank for our economic
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
success we cannot be shy about telling
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
the story about what we're
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
doing which is why I felt it was so
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
important to keep funding going to
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
promote our state encourage tourism and
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
spread the gospel of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
way and since we're on the subject of
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
what draws others here our natural
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
beauty as a state is both one of our
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
points of Pride but it's more than that
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
it is the Bedrock of our unique quality
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
of life here in New
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to me it's pretty common sense
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
to say that our North Country our Lakes
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
Region our beautiful Open Spaces
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
throughout this state shouldn't be
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
scarred by poorly envisioned projects
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
that detract from our quality of life
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
which is why I am announcing today a
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
landfill moratorium and a revamped
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory process for approving these
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
projects coming forward to ensure that
 
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:30.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:39.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

[Applause]
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
compromised and lastly before I close I
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
want to mention again one of my new
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%

00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
a coach will be working diligently to
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
develop new ideas on how our state can
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
become even better like past Governor
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
appointed commissions to improve
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
government operations we brought in
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
outside experts and we're bringing in
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
new thinking and
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
ideas I look forward to reviewing their
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the coming months as
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%

Northeast and to adjust to the revenue
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
environment we're facing some
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
recalibrations they're in order but we
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
have been thoughtful
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
and taking care to ensure that they will
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
not be felt by those who are most
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and who need

Rocky if right to work was a concern
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
then why did President Trump nominate an
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%

order to save time money and effort it
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%

directly from Trump's Twitter
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
feed many of you support right to work
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
because you feel that someone should not
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
have to join a union to get a job I

Families right to work is a
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
concept of hollow unfulfilled promises
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
West Virginia passed it the Republican
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
governor was clear all the promised jobs
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
never showed up Oklahoma passed it and
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
all it did was lower
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
wages it is a failed concept of a bygone
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
era pushed by an organization whose
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
influence and relevance is rapidly
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%

Clark thank you Mr
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker just just a quick question Mr
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker is this Deja Vu or
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
vuja for some of the newer members in
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
the house it's probably vuja because
 
00:58:35.789 --> 00:58:35.799 align:start position:0%
they've never heard this before but for
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of us it's definitely Deja Vu
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
we've all been here with this
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
legislation many times for some many
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
many many times because it's first
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
introduced to this house somewhere in
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
the mid 70s and since we are not a right
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
to work state has been voted down with
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support again and again since
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
its Inception on January 22nd the labor
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee which just happens to be the
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
best house the best Committee in the
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
house Mr Speaker we heard over 5 hours
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
of testimony for and against right to
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
work we heard lots of facts and support
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
of from groups like New England citizens
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
for Right to Work Americans for
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and the jiah Bartlet Center
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
for Public Policy just to name a few one
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
fact that we heard was right to work is
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
supported by nearly 80% of the citizens
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I would agree with that
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
it might even be a bit higher everyone
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
believes that people have the right to
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
work but when we asked if the bill was
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
described to people as the union busting
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill that it is yes or no we got the
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
world run
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
around we were told that it was
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
described differently in different polls
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
depending on who was being pulled so in
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
other words no how do I know that that
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
number might be skewed a bit because of
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
the approximately 1500 people that
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
testified in person or online on hearing
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
day less than 100 were in support now I
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
know it's been a while since I was a
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
crusader at Manchester Memorial High
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
School graduating in the top 400 of my
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
class but that does not add up to 80% it
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
7% another fact we heard was that many
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
businesses are lining up to come to New
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as soon as we become a right
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
to work state when we ask for examples
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
of said companies we were told that it
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
was a
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
secret but just last year Governor
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
sonunu said that many businesses are
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire New Balance just
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
built a 100,000 ft building in Londoner
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
and a 500,000 ft building is going up in
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
Hudson I'm constantly seeing stories of
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking ceremonies at the Tuscan
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
Village in Salem where new businesses
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
are either coming in or existing ones
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
are growing and we are still not a right
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
to work state one more quick fact that
 
01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
we heard was union members are forced to
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
pay dues as a condition of employment
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
not only is that against the law but not
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
one not one of the union members that
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition of this Bill
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
said that they were being forced to pay
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
dues we asked they are voluntarily
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
paying I've worked for many good
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
non-union companies for many years but
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
none could commit to the paying benefits
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
that the Carpenters offers so I chose to
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
join the same exact work for better
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
wages and benefits now I asked now now
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
because of the dues that I pay
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
voluntarily what I put in has already
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
come back to me many times over and will
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
continue through my retirement years
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
unless this bill passes once again I
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
would wager my entire 2-year legislative
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
salary that many of you have left a job
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
for a better opportunity
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere like me not everyone is made
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
for college of the military Mr Speaker
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
but many are good with their hands the
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
carpenters in all of the Building Trades
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
have apprenticeships real New Hampshire
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
certified apprenticeships not just
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
banging this nail okay you're a
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
carpenter no the coers create their own
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce and great employees by
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
investing millions of dollars offering a
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
four-year program where apprentices
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
learn many facets of construction from
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
foundations to
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
finish at no cost to them in buildings
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
paid for by the members not through your
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes or state funding
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
thousands of apprentices and Journeymen
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
are trained at our training centers
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
every year think about it they earn
 
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
while they learn so instead of owing 140
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
,000 after four years of college they
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
potentially made
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
$140,000 and nothing says that they have
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
to stay in the union once their training
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
is complete helmet the hard hats a group
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
that places veterans in apprenticeships
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
to start a new career after serving has
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
the Carpenters and Building Trades on
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
speed dial I'd hate to see that
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity that has helped so many be
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
lost through the passage of this bill I
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
understand that some of you have had a
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
bad experience with the Union you may
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
may be disgruntled because of that bad
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
experience I get it not every day for me
 
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
is perfect in any way but I chose to
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
stay with it keep it knowing that it
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
would the the the bad would be um
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the
 
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
good please remember that union members
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
are members of our communities they live
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
in our towns pay their taxes and
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
frequent our local businesses some are
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
small business owners themselves the
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
union subc Contra that I work for is out
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%

01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
one of the owners is a union carpenter
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
as was his dad and now so is his son
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
they're a family-owned women-owned
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
business that has created millions of
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
hours for their Union employees over the
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
years and the labor committee which just
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
happens to be well you know Mr Speaker
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
it is said that almost every meeting
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
that we should not get between a
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
business owner and their
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
employees let's not start
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
now coer is another building trade
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer their skills to many great
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
causes I've personally participated in
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
at least three makea wish progress
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%

my
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
constituents Mr Speaker esteem
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
colleagues I apologize if I seem a bit
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
nervous or on edge up here today but I
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
assure you it's not because I'm up here
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
speaking in front of all of you it's
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
because all of you are deciding my
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
future and the futures of thousands of
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
union members if this deal if this bill
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
does not pass it will affect no one I
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
believe that to be true because I've
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
never heard of any business going under
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
because of right to work did not pass if
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
it does the families of approximately
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
one in 10 of our constituents including
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
me and many uning companies will be
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
negatively affected after busting my ass
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
on construction sites for over 40 years
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
freezing in the winter sweating in the
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
summer I'm looking to finally retire in
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
about 6 months but my pension and the
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
pension of many others may be in
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy why because if this legislation
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
goes through people will be able to join
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
a union without contributing so I ask
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
you how long do pensions last with no
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
money going in like many Union families
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm relying on my pension to last for
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of my and Francine my wife life
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
please join me in indefinitely
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
postponing this mislabeled misleading
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
union busting Bill once again because
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
you all know in your hearts that right
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
to work is and always will be wrong for
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you Mr
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise in opposition to
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement of HB
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
238 this bill is not anti-union it is
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
pro-worker this bill is part of the GOP
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
platform HB 238 is vital to Fair
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
Employment Practices workers and
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
employers should have the option to
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate their own employment
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
agreement we owe it to our businesses
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
to hear these
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
arguments I urge you to join me in
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to the motion by pushing the
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
much representative Sweeney has
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that M does the
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
kraton um would you
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
believe that after bidding on a project
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
I had to create a union company in order
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
to complete our work and that without
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
forming a union company my family would
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
have suffered drastically along with all
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
workers yes ma'am I would believe that
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative seren we has a requested
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
a roll call is that sufficiently

thank you Mr Speaker if I know right to

work has been removed by President Trump
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
from the national Republican platform if
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
I know it has been illegal in New
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to force someone to join a
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
union to get a job since 1949 and if I
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
know that we cannot make America great
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
again if we don't support American
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
that bad legislation being on the books
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
is a reason to fix it instead of
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
accepting the status quo if I know that
 
01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
accepting the status quo if I know that
the

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
state GOP State platform supports ending
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
Force unionism if I know that public
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
sector unions have continued to thrive
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
since the 2018 J Supreme Court decision
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so will private unions after we end
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
forced unionism if I know that no person
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
who wants to be a union member will be
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
affected in any way but the people who
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to join a union will benefit
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
making this a win-win for New Hampshire
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that many union members are
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the performance of their
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
union leaders but have no practical way
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
to influence them if I know that passing
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
this bill will give union members more
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
power leading to unions stop you know to
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
stop taking their members for granted
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
and what present them and lastly Mr
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that our governor and
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
15 out of 24 colleagues from across the
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
worldall publicly stated they support
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker hb27 is
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
a classic example of legislative
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
overreach it usurps you local control
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
ignores long-standing precedent and
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
pushes a legislative solution to a local
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
problem that is a clear answer without
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
without additional
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
statute it is an overreaction to a
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
single decision made last year this bill
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%

Columbus Day which seems completely
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable until we consider the
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%

high-speed ATV use that they have

Hampshire fishing game oppos this bill
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%

01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
owners of the forest this bill likely
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
violates that conservation easement
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker House Bill 127
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
is a very simple bill but one that has
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
great economic impact on the North
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
Country this bill will extend the
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
closing date of 10 miles of OHV Trails
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%

from September 30th to Columbus Day
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
which is approximately two weeks to
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
align this with the rest of the trails
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
area there are approximately 110 miles
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
of trails on private property in
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh just north north northwest of
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
these 10 Mi of connector trails in
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 900 mil of
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
trails to the
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
South as you can imagine when the
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
connected trails are closed down two
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
weeks earlier than the rest of the
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
trails it land loocks the town of
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh from its business community
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the rest of the
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
state these two extra
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
weekends represents $3 million in
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
economic impact to the area
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
state the town of Pittsburgh has a
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
population of 800 residents but a a busy
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
weekend like Columbus Day there there's
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
no problem having 5,000 people in town
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
now fishing game claims they do not have
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Manpower or the money to patrol this
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
10m section of trail for OHV use for the
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
additional two
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
weeks they are paid to patrol 1,000 M of
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
trails around this section until
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day and to actually Patrol this
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
section also just up until September
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
30th fishing game are also already in
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
the entire area because of bird hunting
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
season they claim it will not be safe
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
for hunting in OHV use simultaneously on
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
these 10 miles of trails but it is
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
allowed on the other 1,000 Mi of trails
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
this makes no
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
sense the Coos County Commissioners have
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
set money aside in their budget to pay
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department to patrol this
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
10 Mile parcel of land for the
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
additional two weeks so there will be no
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
cost to the state and no cost efficient
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%

several times to extend the closing date

will likely result in spillover of

potential for more private land to be

close to ohrv use and while electric Ohr
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles are heavier because of their

public to be clear it was not a wave of

viral incomp confidence that spread from
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
coast to coast it was a wave of viral
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
ideology that placed the comfort of
 
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
criminals over the safety of
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
citizens we have seen the result from
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
coast to coast is blood flowing in the
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
streets be it incompetence or activism
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
either way we cannot allow this virus to
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
spread here in New
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be clear some have
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
suggested we we need to reform our barar
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
laws do we need to reform our barar laws
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
maybe but no law we can craft will solve
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the underlying problem in this
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
issue both the executive and the
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary have discretionary Authority

built into their constitutional
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
duties the problem here is not exactly
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
the law that exists the problem is the
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
way that discretion was utilized in a
 
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.470 align:start position:0%

manner no reform we pass can solve that
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
problem and when we try to do more and
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
more reforms that take away that
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
discretion the inevitable result is we
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
will eventually wind up sending decent
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
people to prison who don't really have
 
01:39:44.119 --> 01:39:45.310 align:start position:0%

to

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
go the way we solve this problem is by
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
addressing the root cause of it we
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
expect good decisions good discretion
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
and Prudence from our
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
Judiciary when they do not or will not
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
exercise that we have a duty in this
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
body to affect a removal from office
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
that thereby establishes a precedent and
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
consequences for that kind of
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
thing the Constitution gives us this
 
01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
burden nobody
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
else we are responsible lives quite
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
literally hang in the
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
balance I would request you vote green
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I would ask for a roll call vote
 
01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.589 align:start position:0%
and I would ask for a roll call vote

mistake good afternoon colleagues I
 
03:07:34.349 --> 03:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the post lunch buzzkill
 
03:07:36.349 --> 03:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
but I want to say that one of the
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
biggest threats facing are the economic
 
03:07:42.229 --> 03:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
value the health and the GU quality in
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are cyanobacteria blooms
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
and the incidence of them is increasing
 
03:07:53.229 --> 03:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
every year last summer there were 60
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
66 warnings affecting 43 water bodies
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
resulting in a loss of recreational days
 
03:08:06.110 --> 03:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
or days under warning of 700 and sorry
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
you guys I should have my glasses 799
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
days and although the prevalance of
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
blooms affecting Lake winnus garnered
 
03:08:17.469 --> 03:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
the most public attention most toxic
 
03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
blooms impact smaller bodies of water
 
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
like Emerson pond in ringe and Arlington
 
03:08:25.710 --> 03:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
Mill Pond in
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
Salem this summer New Hampshire
 
03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
predicts this will be the worst summer
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
as far as number and duration of toxic
 
03:08:37.790 --> 03:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
blooms and it's impossible for the state
 
03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
to implement mitigation projects for
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
every water body
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
impacted but we can enable communities
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
to take on these projects on their own
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
in fact since
 
03:08:53.229 --> 03:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
1849 New Hampshire has allowed
 
03:08:56.229 --> 03:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to form Village districts
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
to address very specific issues these
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
could range from fire response sidewalk
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
installation sewer maintenance and
 
03:09:08.110 --> 03:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
supplying Municipal Water there are
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
presently 100 Village districts
 
03:09:13.229 --> 03:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
operating in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
set up for a specific purpose
 
03:09:20.349 --> 03:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
there are 14 of these purposes in
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
statute and House Bill
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
332 asks to add one more add a 15th
 
03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
reason to form a village district and
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
that is to protect and remediate surface
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
waters let's face it the state and
 
03:09:37.279 --> 03:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
waters let's face it the state and
specifically

03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
Dees does not have the resources to
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate all toxic blooms occurring
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but that should not
 
03:09:50.030 --> 03:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
not stop local communities from doing it
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
on their own by forming a village
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
District to protect and remediate their
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes especially those lakes and ponds
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
residing in more than one
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
municipality local communities can move
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
ahead with mitigation projects without
 
03:10:09.309 --> 03:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
waiting for the state to spend state tax
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
dollars and money that may not
 
03:10:16.269 --> 03:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
come those opposed to this bill claim
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
that it adds a another layer of
 
03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
government not true Village districts
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
while having to comply with local and
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
state laws act independently of state
 
03:10:31.150 --> 03:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
and local government they can be formed
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
they must be formed with a majority vote
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
of each and every town that seeks to be
 
03:10:40.990 --> 03:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
part of a village District if those
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
towns vote to form the district the
 
03:10:46.269 --> 03:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
district Commissioners the budget any
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances Etc must be approved by the
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
voters within that district and their
 
03:10:54.990 --> 03:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
decisions are limited to only what
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
protects and remediates water as far as
 
03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
the concern about taxation imposed by a
 
03:11:04.510 --> 03:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
village District I would much rather
 
03:11:07.510 --> 03:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
have a voter in a village District
 
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
approve and pay for its own water
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
projects then for a tax to be imposed on
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of us or by using state revenue
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
HB 332 is the essence of true local
 
03:11:27.269 --> 03:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
control it enables communities to decide
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
if and how to solve their own problem
 
03:11:33.790 --> 03:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
without having to wait on the state for
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
help help which may never come so I ask
 
03:11:40.830 --> 03:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
you to please vote red vote away this
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
itl motion so that another motion can be
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
made that gives local control to those
 
03:11:49.229 --> 03:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
people closest to the problem and more
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
able to solve it thank you very much
 
03:11:58.190 --> 03:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
harb thank you Mr
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker government efficiency we heard
 
03:12:05.309 --> 03:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
that mentioned this morning during the
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
governor's speech HB
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
332 which allows for the establishment
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
of a village District to protect and
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
remediate surface waters adds another
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
layer of government where the state
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
already has the New Hampshire Department
 
03:12:22.110 --> 03:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
of Environmental resources to care for
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
our water quality and enforcement the
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee it was suggested that there
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
are other better methods of obtaining
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
cooperation between towns such as zoning
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendments we do not need to create
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
another layer of government which could
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
possibly increase taxes for those owning
 
03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:41.150 align:start position:0%
possibly increase taxes for those owning
waterfront

03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
waterfront
 
03:12:43.870 --> 03:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
property testimony was received by a
 
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
resident of the town of Newbury located
 
03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
on Lake sopi water shed they stated that
 
03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
the smart protective policies
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
implemented by local town government
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
local town
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
government was the preferred method of
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
creating meaningful protective actions a
 
03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
similar Bill HB 1250 did not pass this
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
house last year please support the
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
majority vote of itl on this Bill thank

be implemented by local town government

our state address this growing problem
 
03:20:21.189 --> 03:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
first a bit of history back in
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
1991 the shoreline water quality
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
protection Act was passed into law the
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
first sentence of its purpose reads the
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
general court finds that the shore lands
 
03:20:35.070 --> 03:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
of this state are among the most
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
valuable and fragile natural resources
 
03:20:41.189 --> 03:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
and their protection is essential to
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
maintain the Integrity of public
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
Waters the ACT goes on to describe many
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
behaviors and actions that violate our
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
public Waters and it states that quote
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
upon Petition of the Attorney General or
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the municipality in which the
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
violation occurred the Superior Court
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
May Levy upon a person violating this
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
chapter a civil penalty in the amount
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
not to exceed
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for each continuing
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
violation end quote it goes on to say
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner after notice and
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
hearing pursuant to RSA 51 541 colon a
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
May impose an administr a fine of up to
 
03:21:28.830 --> 03:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for each
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
offense all HB 422 does is to adjust the
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
maximum fine to
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
$115,000 which in today's dollars is far
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
closer to what
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
$5,000 was worth in 19
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
1991 it doesn't compel the court or Dees
 
03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
to fine at that level but it gives them
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
latitude to get there when the offense
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
is especially damaging to our
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
environment you'll hear the argument
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
that Dees hasn't issued a fine in over
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
12 years well those of you that were
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
here last term may remember that we
 
03:22:15.630 --> 03:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
fixed language in that statute which
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
prevented enfor enforcement from
 
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
occurring that fix plus updating the
 
03:22:24.189 --> 03:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
maximum level of fines that's in this
 
03:22:27.469 --> 03:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
bill will serve as a strong deterrent
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
for those who think they can violate our
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
Waters without
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
consequence as I've said before toxic
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms pose a grave danger
 
03:22:41.469 --> 03:22:41.479 align:start position:0%

03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
provides a meaning ful deterrent to
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
lessen the threat of toxic cyanobacteria
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%

03:22:58.349 --> 03:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
Shoreline damage please vote red to vote
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%

Donley thank you Mr
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker I would like to talk about many
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
of things that that uh representative
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
Rong just actually spoke about I agree
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
with most everything that she shared one
 
03:23:26.269 --> 03:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
of the most UN disturbing things that I
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
found Doran committee was how
 
03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
unjustified the increase was basically
 
03:23:34.349 --> 03:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
because there was no fines for the last
 
03:23:37.870 --> 03:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
decade so raising fines from 5 to5 was
 
03:23:40.990 --> 03:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
an assumption rather than based on
 
03:23:45.309 --> 03:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
datadriven analysis of past fines NHD
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
did share the last find they issued was
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the proposed fine increase
 
03:23:52.189 --> 03:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
appears disproportionate and considering
 
03:23:54.070 --> 03:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
the number of fines Dees has enacted
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
over the past decade I would encourage
 
03:23:59.429 --> 03:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
us to let's see how this works out we
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
just passed legislation that actually
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
started in January 1 that the language
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
modification empowers Dees to pursue
 
03:24:09.790 --> 03:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
violators who fail to make good faith e
 
03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
efforts to damage public waterways
 
03:24:14.670 --> 03:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
within violation I'm a big believer in
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
let's do education over legislation for
 
03:24:20.910 --> 03:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
making change and this bill makes an
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
assumption that the increase will
 
03:24:26.429 --> 03:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
promote compliance versus actually fine
 
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
violators to curb their violations to
 
03:24:31.790 --> 03:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
secure the shoreline and water quality
 
03:24:34.110 --> 03:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
protection and as she mentioned yes
 
03:24:35.469 --> 03:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
there is a contained provision that
 
03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
multiplies the penalty by a factor of
 
03:24:41.189 --> 03:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
two for every violation that has not
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
been conformed to so I do encourage
 
03:24:47.070 --> 03:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
people to support the itl and let's let
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
our legislation from last year actually
 
03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
move forward and let's see how this
 
03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
actually works and we actually pursue
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
violators instead of just threatening
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
them representative rung has requested a
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%

03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%

03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%

03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority

03:26:13.189 --> 03:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Mr
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that Dees usually
 
03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
encourage is compliance with the
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
through carrots but sometimes it needs
 
03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
the threat of a stick to enforce
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and if I know that the
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
effective size of that stick the maximum
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
fine level has been reduced by 34 years
 
03:26:32.830 --> 03:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
of inflation and if I know that
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
returning that stick to its original
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
proportional size requires increasing
 
03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
the maximum fine from $5,000 to
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
$15,000 would I push the red button so
 
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
another motion can come forward thank
 
03:26:47.469 --> 03:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
you chair recn representative dony for a
 
03:26:47.479 --> 03:26:50.830 align:start position:0%
you chair recn representative dony for a
parliamentary

03:26:50.830 --> 03:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:26:54.990 --> 03:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of enironmental Services
 
03:26:57.309 --> 03:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
has not been consistently finding
 
03:26:59.950 --> 03:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
violators for the last decade it rises
 
03:27:01.590 --> 03:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
the question about effectiveness of the
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
empty threats and versus enforcement and
 
03:27:07.189 --> 03:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
updating penalties if I know without
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
solid data to support the Assumption
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
behind the bill I challenge whether the
 
03:27:13.469 --> 03:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
proposed increase fines would generally
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually improve the compliance without
 
03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:17.389 align:start position:0%
actually improve the compliance without
enforcing

03:27:17.389 --> 03:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
enforcing
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know starting January 1 this
 
03:27:22.990 --> 03:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
year the changes to the RSA updating the
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
shoreline quality protection act RSA
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
which now allows DS to submit fines
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
within the year will generate the buzz
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
amongst the lak front owners and Dees
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to enforce these penalties
 
03:27:38.670 --> 03:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
to take to tackle blatant violators what

a dispute over jurisdiction uh
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
particularly regarding the piscatqua
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%

the law are on New Hampshire's side on
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
this and it's well documented um by
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Bob Smith's report from I
 
03:34:00.590 --> 03:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
believe 1998 all of the documentation as
 
03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
to where New Hampshire's border lies
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
with the the colony of Massachusetts is
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
across the street with the Attorney
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
General's office uh because in 2005 a
 
03:34:13.950 --> 03:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
very similar resolution was passed uh
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
with overwhelming bipartisan support
 
03:34:20.429 --> 03:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
support this resolution um mirrors that

uh there's no there's no reason why a
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
single member of this house should
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
really be against this resolution um it
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
affirms uh what was stated in that 2005
 
03:34:33.309 --> 03:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
resolution the only difference is it EXA
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
it asks for the executive branch of the
 
03:34:37.229 --> 03:34:37.239 align:start position:0%
federal government to issue an executive
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%

F thank you Mr
 
03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if my colleagues have read the
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
majority report or the text of the
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
resolution itself or watched our
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee discuss
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
hcr9 they've probably heard a lot of
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the contents of the the
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%

03:40:56.670 --> 03:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
csdd so they may have heard that the
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
regulations might be overreach by the
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
European Union but I am here to say the
 
03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
text of the resolution doesn't matter
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%

03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%

of the lyrics to Big Yellow Taxi we

should all be against this
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
resolution there's context that has
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
largely been missing from this debate
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
and it's that these regulations are an
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
inherent aspect of international trade
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
the CFR the code of f Federal
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%

03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
standards for importing meat into the
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
United States there are offices in the
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
executive branch that exist just to help
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
companies navigate foreign trade
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
regulations and intercede if companies
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
find said regulations too
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
burdensome this isn't EU overreach it's
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
a global
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%

Congressional interference hcr9 urges
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
Congress to reject compliance with the
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
csdd but they can't do that they aren't
 
03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
a party to it it's a relationship
 
03:42:46.349 --> 03:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
between private business businesses and
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
the EU and businesses want to trade with
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the EU it is some of the wealthiest
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
consumers in the world and it's much
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
easier and cheaper for them to just
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
standardize their entire process than
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
adjust for different International
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
standards depending on where the
 
03:43:05.790 --> 03:43:05.800 align:start position:0%

EU I don't think any of us want to tell
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
our constituents that the reason they
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs is because this body
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
decided to start a trade War
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
but the biggest reason to reject hcr9 is
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
this the European commission is meeting
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
this month or the next and is expected
 
03:44:59.309 --> 03:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
to loosen the standards in the

untimely Reckless and does not serve the
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire I urge this
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
body to overturn the OTP and find this
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%

Reckless it was passed last summer all
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
the European countries have a
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%

03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%

03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
international agreements some of which
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
we probably agree on no child labor no

s this is compliance with all the

adopted climate change
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
policy all the covered parties the
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
covered parties that uh to which this
 
03:47:10.030 --> 03:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
apply start with large businesses that
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
have over a half million dollars worth
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
of sales in the EU
 
03:47:18.269 --> 03:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
but worse it applies to all their
 
03:47:18.279 --> 03:47:19.870 align:start position:0%
but worse it applies to all their
contractors

03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
03:47:25.030 --> 03:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
suppliers and uh Partners upstream and
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
downstream so Nestle was mentioned
 
03:47:31.070 --> 03:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
Nestle buys a lot of its sugar from
 
03:47:33.870 --> 03:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
sugar beat manufacturers in North Dakota
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to comply with all
 
03:47:35.439 --> 03:47:36.910 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to comply with all
those

03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:47:39.149 --> 03:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
standards in New Hampshire we have
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
Electronic Component manufacturers that
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
are selling to Ford Mercedes whoever and
 
03:47:48.830 --> 03:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
again all those smaller suppliers are
 
03:47:51.550 --> 03:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
swept in because they are buying or
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
selling or working with a larger
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so these covered companies
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
must meet all these 89
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
standards and again including their
 
03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
suppliers and if they cannot if those
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
smaller companies they work with can't
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
meet them then the larger companies are
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
required to pay for their compliance
 
03:48:16.830 --> 03:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
if you do not meet these standards
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
you're subject to a 5%
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
annual um fee of of your net revenue in
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
the EU or you have to stop selling in
 
03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:28.630 align:start position:0%
the EU or you have to stop selling in
the

03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
EU so this resolution basically asked
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government and I'm assuming
 
03:48:37.389 --> 03:48:37.399 align:start position:0%
this is going to be the executive branch
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
to tell the EU that we do not
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
Support Compliance with their directive
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
mandates on American
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
businesses we suspect or I suspect this
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
may trigger the t-word
 
03:48:58.830 --> 03:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
tariffs it's worked very well so far and
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
I suspect it will work this time as
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
well the Trump Administration has
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
already said no to most of these ESG
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for government purposes
 
03:49:15.550 --> 03:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
this resolution asked the the executive
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
department to say no for American
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
businesses press green
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
please representative Sweeney has
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%

04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker like my eloquent
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
friend from Amherst this morning I feel
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
a sense of deja vu giving this speech uh
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is one of the first speeches I gave
 
04:01:59.950 --> 04:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
in this body about two years ago uh and
 
04:02:01.950 --> 04:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
we passed that bill with a solid
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support I hope we can do the
 
04:02:04.199 --> 04:02:05.389 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support I hope we can do the
same

04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
today some of uh my friends who are
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill talk about it as if
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
it were an intervention into who a
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
sacred doctor patient relationship let's
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
be clear about something this is not a
 
04:02:21.710 --> 04:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship this is a
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
relationship between a veterinarian and
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
the patient in this case is a cat and if
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
we gave cats a choice I'm pretty sure
 
04:02:32.910 --> 04:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
that they would in fact support this
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
legislation what this bill does is it
 
04:02:39.870 --> 04:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
leaves open the possibility for medical
 
04:02:42.670 --> 04:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
discretion it does a veterinarian can
 
04:02:44.830 --> 04:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
say that there are legitimate medical
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why this procedure has to be
 
04:02:48.910 --> 04:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
done and that is entirely permissible
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
within the bill so it is not an
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
intrusion in that relationship it is not
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
taking away the ability of veterinarians
 
04:02:57.630 --> 04:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
to make the best medical uh decisions
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the patient which is the cat I would
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
also point out that the centers for dis
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
Disease Control for some time now has
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
not advocated the declawing of cats for
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
people who have certain autoimmune
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
disorders or certain disorders related
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
to blood blood clotting in fact removing
 
04:03:18.349 --> 04:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
a CL cat's claws make it more likely to
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
bite which is a far greater danger to
 
04:03:22.990 --> 04:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
the health of the owner than cat
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
scratches are our committee heard a lot
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
of testimony from members of the public
 
04:03:31.229 --> 04:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
as well as Veterinary professionals that
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
this continues to be despite talk about
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
how things supposedly have evolved over
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
the past 30 or 40 years it continues to
 
04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
be simply an inhumane procedure and it
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
should not be permitted in the state of
 
04:03:46.590 --> 04:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank

Aaron thank you Mr
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker welcome back dear house
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues to our what seems to be my
 
04:04:06.750 --> 04:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
neem cat
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
fight I rise today to ask that you vote
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
Yes to itl this bill hb21 one which
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
would ban the deying of cats in New
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and codify criminal penalties
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
for veterinarians who perform this
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
procedure in reality this bill is a
 
04:04:29.469 --> 04:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem the
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
majority in this committee voted to itl
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
this bill because there is no real need
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
to ban this procedure or codify harsh
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
penalties to
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarians we do not have any stati
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
statistics that demonstrate that New
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a problem with our
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarians performing cat declin
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
procedures for non-medical reasons
 
04:04:56.830 --> 04:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Additionally the criminal penalty in
 
04:04:58.830 --> 04:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is really
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
unenforcable who could prove that a
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian did a declaw without a
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
valid medical reason New Hampshire
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarians should not have to worry
 
04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
about being accused of Performing this
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
or any other procedure
 
04:05:17.070 --> 04:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from New Hampshire
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that the overwhelming
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire veterinarians
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
already discourage or do not offer cat
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
decline procedures and instead work with
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
cat owners to use behavior modification
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
and other techniques to prevent the cat
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
from scratching family members or
 
04:05:39.550 --> 04:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
destroying property when those
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
techniques fail and the veterinarian
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
determines that declawing is the only
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
remaining solution aside from rehoming
 
04:05:48.560 --> 04:05:49.750 align:start position:0%
remaining solution aside from rehoming
or

04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
euthanasia then that should remain a
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
choice between the cat owner and the
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarian if an owner has tried all
 
04:05:59.710 --> 04:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
methods available to cease chronic
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
scratching and if deying was made
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
illegal their options would be to
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
abandon the cat rehome it to an
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting home or Surrender it to a
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
shelter or they might even take their
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
cat to a state where declawing is not
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
banned we heard in testimony that cat
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
declaw procedures are only done by New
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinarians when medically
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
necessary for the cat or for instances
 
04:06:32.429 --> 04:06:32.439 align:start position:0%
when cat owners have medical conditions
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
that could be life-threatening or if
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're by like if they're scratched by
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
their cats and if they're on blood
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
thinners it does
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
happen it's an absolute last resort to a
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
chronic cat scratching Behavior we also
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
heard that modern techniques such as
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
laser surgery yield better and much
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
safer results than techniques used in
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
the past and that declawed cats can and
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
do live long healthy and happy lives
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's well known that certain animal
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
activist organizations are flooding the
 
04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
state legislatures across this country
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
with these types of bills and once they
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
get one procedure banned they continue
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
to come back and try and ban others and
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
they use these campaigns specifically to
 
04:07:22.640 --> 04:07:23.870 align:start position:0%
they use these campaigns specifically to
fund

04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
raise lastly and most
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
importantly the majority of our
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
committee felt very
 
04:07:33.109 --> 04:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
strongly and I'm going to say this again
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
the majority felt very strongly that we
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
as a legislature should not go down the
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
road of removing autonomy from New
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinarian
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
and dictating to them what procedures
 
04:07:49.109 --> 04:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
offer our licensed veterinarians have
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
the knowledge the experience and the
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
wisdom to work with their clients to

commit report of inexpedient to
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%

04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
2011 this is a division

vote chair recognizes representative H
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.630 --> 04:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
practice of declaring cats is
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
inhumane which is why fish and game the
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
CDC and other reputable
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
organizations believe it should not be
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
allowed and if I know that despite its
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
being perhaps rare in New Hampshire
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
there is evidence that it's still being
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
done and if I know that the vet client
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
relationship will not be harmed in the
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
least by this bill's
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
passage and finally if I know Mr Speaker
 
04:10:32.590 --> 04:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill does more than scratch
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
the surface but rather allows our feline
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
friends to scratch at will would I now
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
vote red so that a better motion can be
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
made thank you Mr
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%

turmoil we were
divided

04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
divided
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
drastically by the whole issue of
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
slavery by the time
 
04:27:37.630 --> 04:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
he was
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
inaugurated half the states had seceded
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
from the Union
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
situation the other person that I want
 
04:27:56.750 --> 04:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
to honor that you might not know so much
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
about was Frederick
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
Douglas Frederick
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
Douglas was born a
 
04:28:08.830 --> 04:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
slave he never knew who his father
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
was his mother was sold off when he was
 
04:28:12.239 --> 04:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
was his mother was sold off when he was
very

04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:28:18.750 --> 04:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
young so he grew up in a terrible
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
situation he but he had a deep seated
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.750 --> 04:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
teenager he tried to
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
escape one time he he they caught him
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
and brought him back beat him he tried
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
to escape again they caught him and
 
04:28:46.109 --> 04:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
brought him back and beat him
 
04:28:48.870 --> 04:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
again the third time he
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
North and became a
 
04:28:57.760 --> 04:28:59.590 align:start position:0%
North and became a
celebrated

04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
celebrated
 
04:28:59.600 --> 04:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
celebrated
celebrated

04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
celebrated
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
speaker and
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
printer he became acquainted with
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
William Lloyd Garrison Who was the the
 
04:29:15.389 --> 04:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
publisher of the leading abolitionist
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
newspaper in the
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
north and he from the time he went North
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
he became celebrated not just in the
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
north but all over the world he was a
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
abolition he never knew what his birth
 
04:29:42.800 --> 04:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
abolition he never knew what his birth
date

04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
was but he chose February
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
14th because the few times he saw his
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
mother she called him her little
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
Valentine so he chose 14th that February
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
14th as his
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
birthday so when Lincoln was
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
elected the South had
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
seceded the country was going going down
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
path the issue of slavery came up in
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
front of
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
Lincoln was sort of an agnostic he hated
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
slavery but he he knew that he couldn't
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
slavery he he said very famously he said
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
if I could save the Union
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
by freeing the slaves all the slaves I
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
would do it but he said
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
also if I could save the
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
Union by not freeing a single slave I
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
also so after Lincoln was
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
inaugurated Frederick Douglas went to
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
Washington and broke in through a line
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
of off office Seekers and elbowed his
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
way to
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and bent his
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
ear and Lincoln was so taken by
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
Frederick Douglas that for the rest of
 
04:31:26.239 --> 04:31:27.790 align:start position:0%
Frederick Douglas that for the rest of
their

04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
lives they
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
became terrific admirers of each
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
other and Lincoln knew that he could
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
not he could not eradicate slavery
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
but he worked with Douglas and Douglas
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
him and
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
together on January 1st
 
04:32:01.109 --> 04:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
1863 Lincoln issued his Emancipation
 
04:32:04.990 --> 04:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
Proclamation now for that we remember
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
Lincoln as he's the guy that freed the
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
slaves but that's not really true
 
04:32:15.030 --> 04:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
because Lincoln only the Emancipation
 
04:32:15.040 --> 04:32:17.229 align:start position:0%
because Lincoln only the Emancipation
only

04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
applied to the
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
Confederacy it didn't apply to the to
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
the states that had slaves that were
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
loyal to the to the
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
union so as the as the
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
Union forces mve through the South and
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
liberated the South they liberated those
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
slaves and those slaves became free
 
04:32:48.030 --> 04:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
but by the time the war was over there
 
04:32:50.950 --> 04:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
were still about a half a million slaves
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
US they were in the border states
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Maryland Delaware yes Delaware
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
was a slave state
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
but so there were a half a
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
Frederick Douglas was looking forward to
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
working with
 
04:33:18.510 --> 04:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
Lincoln to get the job
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
done and
 
04:33:24.269 --> 04:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
to give the
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
freed black former slaves an opportunity
 
04:33:29.160 --> 04:33:30.510 align:start position:0%
freed black former slaves an opportunity
to

04:33:30.510 --> 04:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
participate in the in the real
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
America well that didn't
 
04:33:36.920 --> 04:33:38.551 align:start position:0%
America well that didn't
happen

04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's life was taken as we all know
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
inauguration but Frederick
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
Douglas kept working at it kept working
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
at it and slavery was
 
04:33:55.439 --> 04:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
at it and slavery was
finally

04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
finally
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
eradicated in the 13th Amendment to the
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution in December of
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
1865 and that's when slavery ended and
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
Douglas didn't stop
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
there the 14th and the 15th 15th
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
critical Douglas not only worked for the
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
freedom of of black folks but he also
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
worked for women's suffrage and and a
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't know that but he was
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
