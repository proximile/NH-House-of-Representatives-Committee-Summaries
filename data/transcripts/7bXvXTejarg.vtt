District 3

Laconia I am introducing HB 275 of which
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor an act relative to the
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
governor's power to initiate a state of
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
emergency and various emergency
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
Powers this bill revises the governor's
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management powers in RSA
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
445 and requires the legislature or
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
executive Council to renew a state of
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
emergency when 445
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
was penned the last year of this covid
 
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh 19 state of emergency could not have
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
been imagined and as such its
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
problematic real world shortfalls became
 
00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.550 align:start position:0%
problematic real world shortfalls became
apparent

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
445 was never put forth to circumvent
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
our constitutional government and the
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
branches of checks and balances yet
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
inadvertently it has HB 275 is set to
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
remedy those issues in section one
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
a condition that must be specified is
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
added under
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
e the condition necessary to extend the
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of emergency this is to provide a
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
clear reason to extend a state of
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
emergency and eliminate the current
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
arbitrary sub subjective
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
reasons in section two a b and
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
c those restructure the intent to use
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
the branches of government and not just
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
the executive Branch this would involve
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
both houses of the legislature and
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
provide a safety in the event that the
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
full bodies of the House and Senate were
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
unable to convene by allowing the
 
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
executive Council to address the
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
continuance of a state of
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
emergency D in this section is provided
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
as an incentive or a deterrent uh to use
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that safety as a last
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
resort um HB 275 also includes clud a
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
very important section uh
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
2G this can create a nominal state of
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
emergency kind of a uh state of
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
emergency uh light if you will one of
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
the big attractions to keeping a state
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
of emergency going is to allow the flow
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
of federal funding to come in that can
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
help our state this would keep that door
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
open while not allowing for the
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
extending of powers to any
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.110 align:start position:0%
extending of powers to any
officials

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
section three will make it clear and
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's expressly written quote within the
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
limits of the governor's constitutional
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
and statutory Authority end quote the
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution cannot be usurped and the
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
governor alone cannot create nor suspend
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
law and finally in section 3D is a
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
safeguard against abuse of power by any
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh public officer such that removal from
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
office is
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
possible uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that's uh 275
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
form point of order Madam chair yes
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you is it
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for representative Huff to
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
be testifying uh without having his
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
camera on so that we can see
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
him yes we have had members of the
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
committee speak without without video
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
you only need it to vote however it is
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
more polite of him to turn his video on
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
so he can actually see him it's more
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
effective so I hope he will do so I've
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
done so M there he
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
dude have you completed representative h
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
i I am thank you very much for your
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.269 align:start position:0%
testimony is there any questions from
the

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
committee I have a question Madam chair
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative leus got there first
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
that's fine just a technical question on
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
24 it um it talks about a super majority
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
vote of both Chambers the question is is
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
a super major is the word super majority
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere either in the
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution or Stat because U you know
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
there are different super majorities you
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
know voting it's a legisl
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
some things are 23 some things are 3s
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
some are
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
just uh thank you representative for
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
your question I am not aware of that
 
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.389 align:start position:0%
your question I am not aware of that
particular

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
um uh section typically uh I will say I
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
I'm of the assumption that it would be a
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
two-thirds but I had not noticed a
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
schm thank you madam
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
chair just make sure I'm both on audio
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
and video uh the question I have for
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Huff is the structure F
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
first of all is this a bill of your own
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
devising because it it it it has a
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
number of aspects uh that are troubling
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering whether you're in a
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
position to I know um make changes to
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
accommodate the committee's objections
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative um I'm a
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but I am uh third and batting
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
order uh simply just to introduce the
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill there are other uh Representatives
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
who are far more vested into this and
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
probably could answer questions a lot uh
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
more in depth than I can um I'd be more
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
than happy to to to give you what I know
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
of it I I I do know um a decent amount
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
but there will be uh folks coming in to
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
this discussion they I had to introduce
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
other legislation so um I I would defer
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
to them if if I can't uh answer you
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
madam followup no representative Schmidt
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
he says he did not the best person to
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
answer and other people are coming in so
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
we'll defer the question as well if you
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative saitech uh question
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the chair representative Schmidt
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
asked whether he's in a position to do
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
anything with the bill the fact is the
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
bill is in our possession at this point
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
he doesn't really have anything to do
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
correct the uh but I suspect we're going
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be making some amendments to this
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill representative and that's why
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's a work schedule work session
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled for immediately after the
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
hearings so that we can get your input
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
as well as others on the committee thank
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm aware of that but I appreciate
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
that all right
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
um yes oh perhaps the others are
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
listening but I have a problem uh with
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
this nominal state of emergency and I'd
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
like to get that ball into play and
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's it's either a state of emergency
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
or it's not if this is a subterfuge to
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
get federal funds without it being a
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
real emergency uh I'm not comfortable
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
with that position I don't know that it
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
may be legal it may be but I'm just not
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
comfortable with I believe that
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has some data on
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
that the difference between a fire
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's burning and a fire that is
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
controlled it's still a fire but you
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
treat it differently so we I've made my
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
I've made my point I don't like the idea
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
of that section either so we will uh
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
we'll definitely be discussing that well
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's enough instruction for very good
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
is all right I call just in case
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%

gmail.com okay great I'll do that in
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
right now thank
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
you okay representative O'Brien you had
 
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.790 align:start position:0%
you okay representative O'Brien you had
a

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
question yes I do Madam chair thank you
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
so much um I I wonder if you can answer
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh Hulk thank you for
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question but on page two line3
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about section c and
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
you did change it from uh
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
evacuations and the original bill says
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
compel and you changed it to recommend
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
now my interpretation of recommend is
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
that if the chemical plant
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
exploded we suggest that you uh get out
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
of there and seek shelter but does this
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
remove and perhaps even jeopardize our
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
First Responders because where the a
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation and my interpretation of
 
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.629 align:start position:0%
recommendation and my interpretation of
a

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be they may choose
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
to stay there thus when they do get in
 
00:15:58.199 --> 00:15:59.389 align:start position:0%
to stay there thus when they do get in
trouble

00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
and it gets past the time of a safe
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
evacuation First Responders may have to
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
go back at Great
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
risk and to get them to leave so should
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
it uh what made you think of going and
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating the compel to go to a
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh thank you for the
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
question representative O'Brien
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
um that was not necessarily a section
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
that I uh I penned however ever um
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
further on from recommend and and I
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
agree with your assessment um it would
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
be recommend it would not be to compel
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh further on down it says any person
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
who does not evacuate such an area upon
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of the governor shall
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
not receive any additional accommodation
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
or Aid at the expense of the state so
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
literally it is up to the individual if
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
they uh if they decide that it's a good
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
idea to get out they can use uh the the
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh the offers of the the state for help
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
um if they decide that they uh would be
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
better off on their
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
own and they're on
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
their I I follow up Madam chair follow
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you and yes representative I
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
did receive that section and I
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're what you're
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
saying there they would not receive any
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh additional accommodations or at the
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
aid of the state but my question is
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
directly the difference between a
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation and the compel also takes
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
into account
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
and if you could focus on it the F the
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
lives of the First
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
Responders that are evacuating the
 
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.510 align:start position:0%
Responders that are evacuating the
situation

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the best I can I can do for you uh Mr
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative is is a hypothetical and
 
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.430 align:start position:0%
representative is is a hypothetical and
hypothetically

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
you I would think that a first responder
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
would be in more Danger trying to drag
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
somebody out of their home as opposed to
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
just having them come willingly
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
other than that it would all be in a
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
theoretical State all this does is give
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh a person uh the ability to use their
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
own good judgment as opposed to being
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
forced by the government that's all
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you madam
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
chair thank thank you for the has a
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
question it's not a question but U I
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the sponsors but I may
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
able clear up that
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
question um I think hold get back I'm
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure we'll be getting back to
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
it still had a question I think who else
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
had a question representative gr oh we G
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
I um I will um not ask my question I'll
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
just the work session thank you I'm
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
sorry R gr I didn't hear that you
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
weren't loud enough I'm sorry I uh
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
removed my question oh excellent
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
representative Shu you had a
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
question madam
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh following through on the line
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
of question that representative O'Brien
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
put forward I would ask um
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative Huff if he's aware that
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
in h a major evacuation situation you're
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
going to have many First Responders on
 
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.149 align:start position:0%
going to have many First Responders on
the

00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
scene um it's likely that whoever would
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
have approached a person telling them
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
that they need to evacuate and learning
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
that a person is resistant to that there
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
would likely be other First Responders
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
who would not get that mess that's not
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
something that I believe would
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
ordinarily go out over their uh normal
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
lines of communication look out uh the
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
house third from the right uh they're
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
not going to evacuate I don't see that
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
happening um how can you expect that
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
you're not putting a certain number of
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
those responders in danger because
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to go back and attempt to
 
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
they're going to go back and attempt to
still

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
rescue uh I believe that's a question
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that can't be answered so uh I think we
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
will add we've already said we're going
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be discussing this among the
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee I don't believe representative
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
Huff has a definitive answer for this
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
one all right I just wondered if they
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
had thought about that I think the
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
question is is that it will depend a
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
great deal on what type of an emergency
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
it is whether it's a fire or a flood or
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
a winter
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
storm those are the much those are the
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
most common forms of emergency in New
 
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.190 align:start position:0%
most common forms of emergency in New
Hampshire

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.149 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
correct

00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.950 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
other okay other no questions uh that
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
case I will recall Mr Justin katees from
 
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
case I will recall Mr Justin katees from
uh

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
Nashville good morning thank you very
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
much for the opport opportunity to
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Justin Kates I'm the
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
director of Emergency Management for the
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
city of nashille I've been in this
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
position for the last decade and I I'd
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
like to just provide some of my concerns
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
about how House Bill
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
275 uh will impact the city's ability to
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
respond and recover from disasters
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's two primary issues that we have
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh with the language of this bill the
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
first one being uh the additional
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
stipulations that have been added to RSA
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
445 uh for the state of emergency
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
declarations uh and how they're renewed
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the legislative process is often slow
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
and deliberate to provide policy makers
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to engage with a a
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
wide variety of stakeholders and fully
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
assess the short-term and long-term
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
considerations conversely Disaster
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
Response must be Swift and thorough to
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
save lives and deal with the rapidly
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
changing Dynamics and complexity
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly prevalent in these types of
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
disasters being experien today uh so any
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislative action that impedes the
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
state's ability to respond quickly and
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensively is really of great
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
concern to the Emergency Management
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
Community um I think another concern
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
there with the changes to 445 uh related
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
to extensions in this nominal state of
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
emergency uh really concern around any
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
gaps that might occur between the
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
initial emergency declaration and the
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
extension approval by either the general
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
court or the executive
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
Council um FEMA has taken a a kind of a
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
significant position I in the last uh
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
few years to really downshift uh more
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
cost to State and local government and
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
try and reduce its role in disaster
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
recovery and I see concerns about how
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
FEMA would interpret uh this nominal
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
state of emergency as a legitimate state
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
of emergency uh the nominal state of
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
emergency is not likely to be seen as
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate if its only purpose is really
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
for eligibility for disaster cost
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
recovery programs uh this can add
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
additional justification to Fe that its
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
programs are not necessary Beyond simply
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
providing financial assistance to State
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
and local
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
governments uh similarly the absence of
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency declaration if it's
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
been discontinued due to the lack of
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
renewal uh during a long-term disaster
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
uh certainly could send a signal to the
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
federal government that the event has
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
been handled and does not warrant a
 
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.590 align:start position:0%
been handled and does not warrant a
federal

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
declaration um I think overall in that
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
first component of this uh Bill disaster
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
recovery programs are complex in nature
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
and require emergency Management's
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration and coordination with many
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
diverse interests within the community
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight of Disaster
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
Recovery is exceedingly helpful when
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
Solutions can be crafted that address
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
red tape and other obstacles to other
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
expeditious community and economic
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
recovery the the second primary concern
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh is to the evacuation language that's
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
been added in
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
445 uh it does not reflect the realities
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
of challenges encountered in disasters
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
requiring the evacuation of individuals
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
and families and it's not realistic to
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
expect that all residents and visitors
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
be intimately aware of the potential
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
threats and hazards that they could be
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
exposed to at all times an individual or
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
family in an unfamiliar area of the
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
state perhaps staying at a vacation
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
property may be unaware of the potential
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of remaining in place and
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
may misjudge the likelihood of impact
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
even when considering personal property
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
and buildings that are very familiar to
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
the person being asked to evacuate they
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
may look to try and interpret resources
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
such as flooded indas maps that are not
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
as accurate or up to date as many would
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
like to believe Hazard conditions are
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
inherently Dynamic weather conditions
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
change hazardous material plume shift
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
Direction evacuation routes experience
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
congestion and the combination of
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
numerous variables can create a threat
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
far beyond what was initially expected
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
in theory the addition of language
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
saying any person who does not evacuate
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
such an area upon the recommendation of
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
the governor shall not receive
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
additional accommodation or Aid at the
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
expense of the state sounds reasonable
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
but repeated experiences across the
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
country have demonstrated that this is
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
not realistic we've seen countless
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
examples during disasters of individuals
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
and families who initially decided
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
against evacuating later to decide that
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
they need help as conditions rapidly
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
degrade we see heroic examples of First
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
Responders UNT taking undertaking
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
extremely risky rescue operations simply
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
because they see this call for help as
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
an integral part of their duty to serve
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
in conditions when when their hands have
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
been tied due to laws policies or
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
procedures similar to those outlined in
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
HP 275 we see an emergence of homegrown
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated civilian groups that take
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
it upon themselves to rescue people
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
under dangerous conditions when Public
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
Safety organizations are unwilling or
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
unable these individuals and groups
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
create numerous complexities in the
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
emergency response in could pose
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
additional safety hazards without the
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
correct training with only a recommended
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
evacuation more local public safety
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
entities may be forced to issue conflict
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
protective actions or make the the
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
difficult decision of providing Aid when
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
it is already unsafe to do so ultimately
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative Emergency Management
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and public health teams
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
work collectively with public uh safe
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
with subject matter experts to assess
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
the best available Hazard information
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
during an impending emergency in order
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
to recommend protective actions to the
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
governor the governor's ability to
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
direct the evacuation of an impacted or
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
threatened area is a tool that should
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
not be removed in the mergency
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
management toolbox the governor is in a
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
unique position to protect residents and
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
visitors from hazards that are not bound
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
or contained by municiple boundaries we
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
recommend this committee vote
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on HB 275 thank
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent Schmid do you
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
question I do Madam chair let me just
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
turn on my camera here so uh Mr Kates uh
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
you've raised the issue that I wish to
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
ask the SP the one of the co-sponsors
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
but but uh the question was deferred to
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
later but you your testimony raises the
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
very issue of workability of this this
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
the bill in many of its uh
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
manifestations um are you aware of of
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
any uh state or country for that matter
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
where uh the the executive uh is
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
basically uh hands over its required
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
emergency authority to the leg
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislature um as such as this bill you
 
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.310 align:start position:0%
legislature um as such as this bill you
know

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
provides representative I'm not aware of
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
a situation like that in in Most states
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the country there are emergency um
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions to allow for a state of
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
emergency that enable similar types of
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
activities to what's seen in RSA 445 but
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any that uh transfer
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
power uh during that renewal over to the
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislature right followup so uh you
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
specifically talked about the
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
legislature being uh you know equipped
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
to uh to deal with uh situations
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
involving uh you know study
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
consideration uh and drawn out periods
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
of time when emergencies uh require
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
immediate action uh can you imagine a
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
situation where the legislature would
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
get tied up and and the emergency would
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh greatly go uh over the top as a
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
result of uh the legislature's inability
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
to act
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
expeditiously so our primary concern in
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
in that case would be um
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
enabling the the quick renewal of uh
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency declaration under
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
those circumstances where we have a long
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
duration disaster and we're not even
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
talking about just simply um covid-19 as
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
an example this is the first uh that
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
we've seen where there's been a kind of
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
this Marathon response uh for almost u a
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
year and now we're going into over a
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
year um I I think people don't recognize
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
that a flood the hurricane some sort of
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
a major disaster can easily go beyond
 
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.149 align:start position:0%
a major disaster can easily go beyond
that

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
21-day uh initial state of emergency
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
requirement and the additional
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
stipulations added by this bill uh just
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
really open up a Pandora's Box in
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that state of emergency
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
can continue uh without delay into those
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh those coming weeks thank you very
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair I I would just
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Kates I didn't quite catch his
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
enti and entire title and job
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility could he repeat that
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm the director of Emergency
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
Management for the city of nashal thank
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
you very much

Audio

00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
Audio
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
Only um so yes um thank you madam chair

representative blosic um I um am here to

speak on uh HB 275
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
um I did uh help pen this um so I'm
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that I can answer some of the
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
questions that um representative Huff
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
could not answer um Andrew manuse is
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
also on this call and he also helped uh
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
write this so I just want to resp
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
respond to a few points that were made
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how adding legislative
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
oversight to the state of emergency in
 
00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
oversight to the state of emergency in
PE

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
PE
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh emergency response it truly doesn't
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
change anything about the state of
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
emergency other than handing some of the
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking to the legislature and we
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
did understand when we wrote this that
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
it may not depending on the emergency
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
always be possible for
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
424 members of the legislature to meet
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
which is why we created what I sort of
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
consider to be the nuclear option which
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
is the ability for the executive Ive
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
Council to
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
meet um and and continue the the state
 
00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
meet um and and continue the the state
of

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
emergency um as far as the um evacuation
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
and I know that people had concerns with
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
the ability of uh law enforcement to
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
understand this but you know with any
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
new regulation or law as that comes
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
about they get retrained on the
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
situation so I would imagine that that
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be handled um in that way
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
um so yes if anybody has any specific oh
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I wanted to address
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
was the nominal state of emergency
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's not the right term um
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's possible that maybe we need to
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
amend that but it what we were hoping to
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
allow for was the ability to have the
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
same state of emergency that we
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
currently have but without handing
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
unlimited authority over to the
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
executive branch right now now as our
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
law is written the executive branch has
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
unlimited Authority with no oversight
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't think that there should
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
always be this where it could go on for
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
you know an unlimited amount of time uh
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
with with the governor being able to
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
make any type of order that he wants so
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
we we simply wanted there to be an
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
option that we could be in a state of
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
emergency without the governor H having
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
the ability to make um emergency orders
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
the state of Wisconsin son actually is
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
attempting to do this with this current
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
emergency and um the previous uh speaker
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
said that other states don't have where
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature has to approve that is
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
actually not true there are other states
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
I I can't remember exactly which one's
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but there are
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
other states where uh a continuation of
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency requires
 
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.710 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency requires
legislative

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Schmidt
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so representative
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
blasic thank you for being here uh I'm
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the idea I'm not
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
sure whether it's this bill or one of
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
the others there are several of them as
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
you know that are pointing in the same
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
direction uh does it require an an a
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote of the executive Council
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
to extend the
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
emergency yes this is the
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
one uh so that that goes right to the
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to ask is it not the
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
case that one single executive counselor
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
then has the uh the power uh and is
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
given the authority actually uh to tie
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
up the renewal of the state of emergency
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
is that a workable provision in your
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
view I guess I would ask the thank you
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
for your question I would ask the re
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question of if we were in a
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
very serious emergency I think everybody
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
would agree that we are in an emergency
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
if C Brook you know is taken out I don't
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
think that there will be a question that
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
we are truly in an
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
emergency how about the situation we're
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
actually in of a pandemic uh
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid you're getting
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I'm sorry there's nothing
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical Madam chair about the
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic the pandemic is a reality
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's been with us for a year it's not
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
a h hypothesis at all I'd like an answer
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
to my question I will answer the
 
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0%
to my question I will answer the
question

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
um the reality is that RSA 445 was never
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
written with the intention of handling a
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
emergency um I could have written
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by the authors of
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
this to that effect um this was intended
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
for war or for a natural disaster or a
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
terrorist attack something like that
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
this was not intended for a disease that
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
is endemic and I think we are at the
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
point with this current emergency where
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
it is no longer necessary to be in a
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that is my personal
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
opinion and that's exactly the the
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
situation that my question goes to if
 
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.109 align:start position:0%
situation that my question goes to if
you

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
have yeah thank you Mr chairman uh if
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have a situation where one executive
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
counselor could withhold his or her
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
approval of extending the the emergency
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
power of the the governor had claimed
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
that would hang it up would it
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
not my opinion is that I would always
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
prefer to air on the side of Freedom
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
that is the intention of when we wrote
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
this law thank you thank you
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you have a
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair um
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious representative you you
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
state that you actually wrote the
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
language in this bill and yet I don't
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
see you listed as a co-sponsor
 
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.270 align:start position:0%
see you listed as a co-sponsor
yes

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I just realized that myself IO I guess
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
I accidentally did not sign off on it um
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative scitech um
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
um representative blasic um normally
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
laws are written because some situation
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
has occurred and we want to prevent it
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
they're not normally prophylactic but I
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
guess that can be can you give me
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
examples of where the governor has
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
exceeded uh his authority in your view
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
here I'm not entirely sure how that's
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
relevant to changing the state of
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
emergency laws but uh yes the governor
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
has violated freedom of assembly he has
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
violated uh freedom of religion um he's
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
violated part uh part one article 2B of
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state constitution and
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
part one article 29 and 37 of the New
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution ution and
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has argued and the
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
courts have upheld that the way that the
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
law is currently written he does have
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
the right to suspend the Constitution
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
now I argue that that is not the case
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
that only during martial law and only
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature May uh call for marshal
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
law declared martial law um but as
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
things stand right now this law gives
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the governor such broad Authority
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
that he has the right to violate the
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
constitution if he so
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
believes that it is necessary in an
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
emergency so yes we are re I think all
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
of the bills that are going in this year
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with the state of emergency laws
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
are intended to reign in some of that
 
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.950 align:start position:0%
are intended to reign in some of that
unlimited

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
Authority thank you thank
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
question um we just heard a number of
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
Articles of the Constitution you cited
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
that the governor has um what you say
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
has proposed were
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um moves and his
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers but yet is it not true
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
you said the courts did not find that uh
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
true thanks for the question yes um no
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
the courts did uphold that in bford
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
versus sonunu back in March that um
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
because of the way RSA 445 is written it
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
is written with such incredibly broad
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
language that he could violate the
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
constitution and civil liberties if he
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
feels it is Justified in an emergency
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that we can allow that
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
to continue for the next emergency that
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
exists that's why I we wrote this that's
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
why uh there are other bills in to start
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
reigning in Governor
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:02.109 align:start position:0%
you
represent

00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%

representative gr still had a question I
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that she didn't mean to drop her
 
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.390 align:start position:0%
think that she didn't mean to drop her
hand

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%

muted I Will Wait thank you okay Madam
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
chair yes excuse me but I don't see
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative proud listed as a
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill either
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shu if you you had let me
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
continue I was going to say he is the
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of House Bill
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
433 which is also about Emergency
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
Management and that's why we're holding
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
a joint meeting on these four bills
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
because they're all
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
intertwined so are we switching to that
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
bill now or I'm not sure we are
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
switching to House Bill 433 and I call
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
Representative proud you will notice a
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
market similarity between 433 and
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
portions of
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
275 thank
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you Madame chairwoman can you
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
hear me yes thank you I am Andrew Prout
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro County District
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
37 the towns of Hudson and
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
pelum the intent of this bill House Bill
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
433 is to ensure that the legislature is
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
involved and has a role to approve
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
long-term states of
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
emergency I think everyone agrees that
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
the executive branch needs some ability
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
to react quickly more quickly than the
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislature can be assembled when an
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
emergency situation arises and that
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
makes sense for for the legislature to
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
delegate Authority for
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
that however when this emergency
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
situation persists for an extended
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
period of time the legislature should
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
role this bill sets that line at 42 days
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
12 121 days state of emergency
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
declaration and one
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
renewal it also contains a provision for
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the legislative bodies to
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
certify that the majority of the members
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the legislature are incapacitated and
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
by extension that they could not meet
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
with a quorum in which case the
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
limitation on the executive is
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
waved thank you for your time and
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
consideration I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
have repres representative lonar you had
 
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
have repres representative lonar you had
a

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
question oh sorry that was delayed I
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
thought one of our reps was in the
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
attendees list that's all okay
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid then thank you
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair so representative proud
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh this current situation is exactly the
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
kind of uh somewhat murky uh situation
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
that uh my
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
question uh to the previous
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative was directed at and I'm
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to ask you the same question how
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
what kind of
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
workability uh do you have when you have
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
as we have now a situation which is
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
viewed very differently uh by members of
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
the public but also members of the
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislature uh you know with claims that
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic is either a serious uh and and
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
deadly epidemic uh Health situation
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
other people say it's a hoax doesn't
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
exist it's this that and what have you
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh is the legislature capable under
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
those circumstances of acting uh to to
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
to make the decision to uh extend the
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
contested uh thank you for the question
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think as we've seen both under uh
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
our current speaker and the previous
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
speaker both of which who have held
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
sessions of the new hampter house which
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
I am going to focus on as the larger of
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the two bodies as the more challenging
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
one to assemble uh during this pandemic
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
and have done so under uh Public Health
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines following Public Health
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines that in ways that have made
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
members from both parties and both uh op
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
camps of opinion uh feel like they are
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to attend and actually get the
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
business of the state done and while yes
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
I think there have been different
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
opinions about how much the legislature
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
has met and how much work it has done
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
versus deferred especially in the
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
previous term uh I think that one of the
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill is to put the
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
burden back on the legislature to
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
actually make decisions and actually
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
exercise its powers as the uh the
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme lawmaking authority of the

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you representative trout
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
you mention mentioned in your previous
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
comment that this would put the burden
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
back on the shoulders of the legislature
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
could you speak up
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
please can you hear me now that's better
 
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.069 align:start position:0%
please can you hear me now that's better
thank

00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned um in your previous
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
this the statute put
 
00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:52.559 align:start position:0%
the back onto the shoulders of the
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
legislature when did the legislature
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
burden um so the burden I'm speaking of
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
is being the
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh being the the body that makes laws
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
and basically sets the direction of the
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
state and uh I I don't mean to be a
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
little bit uh flippant but that has been
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
the the way it has worked since our
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
constitution was adopted back in the
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
1700s that the legislature makes the
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
laws and the executive executes them and
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is always involved
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
in uh when laws need to be waved or
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
changes need to be to be made um so
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps I made a little bit
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%

414e thank you madam chair um we've
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
actually had a lot of the discussion on
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
this because um this handles the issue
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
um between changing compelling
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
evacuation in the state of emergency
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
and changing that to recommend you know
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
which was incorporated in the
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill so the change is to change the word
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
compel to recommend and it has language
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
kind of similar to the previous one it
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
says at the end provided that the
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services shall not be required
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
for those who have chosen not to
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
evacuate and in the answer to some of
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
the questions about that raised earlier
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
I can understand the concern of
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services feeling that they
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
have a a duty to help people even if the
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
people don't want the help and have
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
refused to uh you know follow the
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation to
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
evacuate but you know my view is people
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
have a right to decide if they're going
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
to stay you know where they are or not
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
and you know that does not you know the
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
feeling of other people on how they
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
think they should respond to that
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
situation um does not create a duty on
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
those people in my view to leave now
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
they may be foolish and they may come to
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
regret their decision but I mean that's
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.510 align:start position:0%

laus okay representative
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the language of the bill though says
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
you know if you wave your uh your right
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
to assistance uh you basically uh also
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh you um you give up the right to
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
assistance you think that that's likely
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
to be held to be
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional um can you hear me with
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
the microphone there I can hear you
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't see how it could
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
not be constitutional I mean it's been
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
found all the way up to the Supreme
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
Court that individ that the uh Emergency
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
Services have no duty to protect any
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
particular individual there's actually
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
been multiple cases that have gone as
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
far as the Supreme Court that have
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that uh the case of the
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
police they don't have a duty to come
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
and protect you the Supreme Court's
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
position was they serve a a general
 
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
function of theuring crie now I'm sure
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
that you know police departments fire
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
departments individ police officers and
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
firment you know view it differently but
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
as far as a constitutional question it's
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
not thank you for taking that
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
position okay uh represent Mr katees you
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
had signed up on this bill as well but
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh can I Madam chair I had a question of
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.069 align:start position:0%
uh can I Madam chair I had a question of
the

00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Shu you have a
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you you uh
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative leakas um I would call
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
your attention to in fact one of the
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
things that Mr Kates mentioned about uh
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
how do you propose to handle the
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
situation of someone who first refuses
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
evacuation and then changes their mind
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh we hear quite often particularly in
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
cases of major forest fires uh where a
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
person will
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
rightfully choose to stay at home to try
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
and protect their home but then a
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
firestorm happens and they recant and
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
decide I better get out of here but then
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
it's too late um what say you about that
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
I understand the concern about that
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
and problems that I pause I would hope I
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
mean the way the Bill's written if they
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
refuse evacuation
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
then um Emergency Services don't have a
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
further duty to help them I understand
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they they at least they don't have
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
a legal duty to do so they may feel they
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a duty to do so but you know what I
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
would suggest is that when they're told
 
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.309 align:start position:0%
would suggest is that when they're told
to

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
evacuate whether it's in person or
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
through some broadcas that it will make
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
clear to them that if they refuse the
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
evacuation when it can be done hopefully
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
safely that um
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
they may not they're likely not to get
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
there's no duty to provide them any
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
assistance if they change their mind and
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will you know help people
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
make a better decision and in the end
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
you know if that situation you describe
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
occurs you know my suggestion with the
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services have plans are
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with that and if they can't you
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
know if it's going to be excessively
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous to save the people who have
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
but refuse to evacuate the plan is if
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
they don't um if they can do so
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
reasonably safely and they choose to do
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that's fine if they not
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
required I think my view is that with
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
freedom comes responsibility but the
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
consequences we
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
CH hope informed choice but in any case
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's individual choice to
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
make thank you representative font
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
now uh thank you madam chair um my
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
question is we often uh talk about the
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
necessity for new or revised legislation
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
based on something that has or a problem
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
or fixing a problem of something that
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
has happened do you have an example of a
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
of a case in New Hampshire where evacu
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
evacuation has been
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
compelled um by the governor but people
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
have not uh have not complied to that or
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's been an issue with that I don't
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
have answer that um I mean I wasn't even
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
aware of the statute until I was looking
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
at the emergency order
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
statutes you know in consideration of
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
current emergency and I was surprised to
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
see that people could actually be
 
00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:16.309 align:start position:0%
see that people could actually be
repel

00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
home and a followup Madam chair follow
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
up and and would you think that there
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
would never be a a case where a
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
compelled evacuation could be
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
necessary in the in in event of war or
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
or other
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
disaster uh no I don't believe it'll be
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
right under any circumstances to compel
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
some fact right now you know I might I
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
might believe and argue that they're
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're being foolish at best crazy at
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
worse but you know my view is that's
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
people's right especially know in case
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
talking about some
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative leas for taking my
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
question uh as I look at this and we've
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier uh representative
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
O'Brien brought up First Responders and
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
having to go after folks if they chose
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
not to evacuate in due time um my
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
question is how is it determined that
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
someone um
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
has chosen not to evacuate is there a
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
piece of paper they signed um declaring
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
that they've given up their rights to do
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
this or how do we determine that as
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
First Responders when you see
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
someone in a house that you feel should
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
have been evacuated and you don't know
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they chose on their own
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
or if it's because they couldn't get out
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
on their own because they didn't have a
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
means um how do we determine um if this
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
should happen to go to a court case that
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
these folks didn't get out for another
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
other reason other than not choosing so
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
is there some sort of form or something
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's signed saying that that's their
 
00:56:01.799 --> 00:56:03.510 align:start position:0%
that's signed saying that that's their
their

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
choice first of all as far as court
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
cases go I don't see there a problem
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
with court cases as I mentioned before
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know I understand that individual
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
First Responders and departments may you
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
know lightly I me feel they have a duty
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
um to rescue people if at all possible
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
however numerous cases that have on all
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
as I said all the way at the Supreme
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
Court multiple times that made it clear
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
that there is no such Duty and therefore
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
there should not be a issue now there is
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
a practical issue you rais of you know
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
how do Emergency Services deal with this
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
um at least the emergency evacuation
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
things I've heard of this it's both
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
announced publicly on radio TV that sort
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
of thing U but
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
also Emergency Services people go
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
through you know neighborhoods of
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
notifying people and you know try to
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
convince a leave and somebody you know
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
states that they're refusing to
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
leave then that's the situation now
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
whether wants to have ask them to sign
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
something Asos
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
could draft in some way that's kind of
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you Ma Madam chair and
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
question um I understand your point that
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think emergency evacuations
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
is really
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned in the
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution but however many states and
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
there has been uh situations where case
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
law has been developed and that case law
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
has been adopted by many other states in
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
the example of h a fire situation
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
Michigan versus Tyler which is basically
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
now has become the law of the land do
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
you see by writing this particular Bill
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing or affecting any other area
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
of current law
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the Fire Marshals and uh the
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
attorney generals and any others use
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
those basically Tex laws to uh to affect
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
their particular business on
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
particularly for fire situations to keep
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
the population
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
safe um thank you for the question um I
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
have looked at a number of cases uh the
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
ones that I could find I'm not familiar
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
with the one specifically mentioned if
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
you have a I can try and look it up you
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
know Michigan Tyler but if you got a
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
better I GL have to and also to do that
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
to cons send it and also
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned there maybe some other
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
cases or other actions by States but if
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that people refuse to evacuate
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
there is no further duty to uh to try
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
and get them out at a later time I don't
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
see how there'd be a legal problem in
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
follow up if I may Madam chair yeah to
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
help the representative out if I may uh
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
basically uh by uh adopt a law within
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
our United States and by all states
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
every single fire is uh that is
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
unfriendly is constituted as an
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
emergency so therefore by uh laws and it
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
is a law of this state too every fire
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be investigators to determine
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the cause and everything and by doing
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
that Michigan and Tyler basically says
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
that the fire department does own the
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
building until a certain time that they
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
do have the right to conduct uh a legal
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
type of investigation now this can be
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
extended out in many types of things uh
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
but just to make you aware of it and
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's basically what uh it has to do
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
with the fire uh fire investigations and
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
like I say firefighters are compelled by
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
law to determine the cause because of
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency of the situation so I was
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
just wondering if this could have some
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
hidden type of effect and uh if this was
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
approved by any type of review of uh the
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or any other
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
councel to look to make sure that uh
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
hamstring uh proper investigations
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
during an emergency situation
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um this is under arsa 4453 C which is uh
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's power under declared
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
state of emergency so for uh you know a
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
normal fire this would not have any
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
effect at all it's U aimed at more
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
widespread situations where the governor
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
has declared a state of emergency over
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
some portion of the state or the entire
 
01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.789 align:start position:0%
some portion of the state or the entire
state

01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would it would have
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
any impact on a normal fighting of Fire
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you representative
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you madam
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
Bara

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
Bara
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
Jackie can't hear you trying to stay
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
muted so in case something falls on the
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
floor or something excuse me um so the
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
current statute says that people that
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
men that evacuations are
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory um yes the statute right now
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
says um this 4453 C under the powers the
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
governor has under declared state of
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
emergency to provide for and compel the
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
evacuation of all or part of the
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
population from any strien or threatened
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
area or areas within the state to take
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
such steps as are necessary for the
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
receip and care of such Eva needs so it
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
uses the word
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
compel followup please follow up and you
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
do not think that the governor's office
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
and the information that's provided to
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
them would
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
be would support an
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
evacuation not sure I understand the
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
question I mean the governor could
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
recommend evacuation if this uh Bill
 
01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:04.309 align:start position:0%
recommend evacuation if this uh Bill
were

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
adopted and with you know providing
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
whatever information you thought the
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
office thought was important for people
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
to know to to convince them to be
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
vacated they wouldn't that maybe I
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
misunderstand the question I'm sorry you
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
do let me clarify it under the current
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
statute yeah the governor uses the
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
information that's available to the
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
governor's office to make that
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
decision and you don't feel that's
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
enough to Warrant the statute as it is
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
much Mr katees you signed up to speak on
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
this bill but if your testimony is the
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
same as it was for House Bill 275
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe yeah so it is uh the same
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
concerns particularly around the
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
language that was added uh stating you
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
know provided that emergency services
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
shall not be required for those who have
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
chosen not to evacuate it just it's not
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
realistic there's no way uh for us to to
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
track who has decided not to accept the
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
offer it just it's not possible so our
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
Our Testimony is the same and I'll send
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
a written copy to uh to the email thank
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
you we've gotten one already actually
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for sending
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
it okay all right uh there's no one else
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
has signed up for for house build
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
414 going back to houseu
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
275 I call Andrew manuse who has signed
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.390 align:start position:0%
275 I call Andrew manuse who has signed
up

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Madame chairman uh and
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh today I present testimony
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of HB 275 it's a bill I believe
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
would change state law to clarify
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
executive power during a state of
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
emergency to prude the overreach we have
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
seen over the past year importantly
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's Provisions that I support in HB
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
414 HB 47 and HB 433 which are before
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
your committee as well as HB 277 HB 280
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
HB 325 HB 559 and HB 389 which are
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
before the New Hampshire house committee
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
on leg legislative Administration which
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
also seek to implement additional checks
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
on executive power I trust that you're
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to take the best ideas from all
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
these bills and amend one or two of them
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
to present the best case reform of our
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
emergency statutes for adoption uh I
 
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
also support hcr2 which would end the
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
current state of
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
emergency um I once believed this
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
dystopian nightmare would be over in
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
April of 2020 and the fact of the matter
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
is I I honestly can't believe that I'm
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
presenting this testimony to you today
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
as I never would have imagined an
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
abusive power of this magnitude could be
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
committed in our Free Republic of New
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh part one article 29 of the
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
State Constitution makes it clear that
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
only the legislature May suspend or
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
enact laws in New Hampshire part two
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
Article 5 makes it clear that these same
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
laws may not be repugnant to the
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution arguably RSA 445 has
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
written should align with these
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
principles and in section 3E it should
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
be clear that the governor's authority
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
to perform and exercise such other
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
functions powers and duties as are
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to promote and secure the
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
safety and protection of the civilian
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
population does not give him or her
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
authority to suspend law make new law or
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
suspend the Constitution but during this
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
protracted nightmare the governor has
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
done all three things in fact when it
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
comes to the institution of emergency
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
orders written under the supposed
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
authority of this section the chief
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
executive and his departments have
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
written new policy enforced the same
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
policy and created an adjudication
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
process for the same policy effectively
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
giving the executive branch legislative
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
executive and judicial functions this
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
directly violates part one article 37 in
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution which states that
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature executive and judicial
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
ought to be kept as separate from and
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
independent of each other as the nature
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
of a free government will admit in other
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
words a state of emergency does not
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
erase or minimize the legisl or judicial
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
branches and yet in practice these other
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
two branches have been largely missing
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
in action granted the legislature could
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
at any time vote to Ender the state of
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
emergency under RSA 445 and I argue that
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
it should have back in April 2020 at any
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
point since any day since it was clear
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be no catastrophic
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
curve to flatten and we were simply
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with a really bad virus that any
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
free people could handle with commonly
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
known hygiene techniques and a little
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
guidance and I truly mean the word
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
guidance from a true definition from
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
Health officials however the word
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
guidance has morphed into law and the
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
legislature has been sideline and doing
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
its constitutional Duty and so far has
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
not taken back its power I'm asking you
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
to change that now importantly one
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
reason the legislature has struggled to
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
end the state of emergency is precisely
 
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
because the executive branch has set up
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
a new government running by itself under
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
the color of Law and ending the state of
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
emergency would unravel that new
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
government this is what all of the bills
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned once they become law
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
would prevent from ever happening again
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
now I like HB 275s provisions and have
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
chosen to speak directly on this bill
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
because it's so eloquently and firmly
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
plants The Authority for extending a
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
state of emergency into the hands of the
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislature where it belongs and it
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
preserves autonomy in the hands of the
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
people to govern themselves even in the
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
midst of chaos because in America we
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
believe the people know best how to
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
manage their own lives and the lives of
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
those around them while the bill
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
provides for contingency plans for True
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
emergencies during which the legislature
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
cannot meet it also provides strict
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
penalties to the government during this
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
time period so that the emergency cannot
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
be extended Beyond its reasonable life
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
the governor ought to have the right to
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency after all
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
he or she is managing the day-to-day
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
operations of the state and will have
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
access to the most up-to-date
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
information however the governor ought
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be checked before extending a state
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
of emergency to prevent abuse use of
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
power particularly like we've seen in
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
the last year at no point May the same
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
Governor employ his or her state of
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
emergency to enact new laws or suspend
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
them which HB 275 Section 3 E's addition
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
under the law clarifies language in 3A
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
of HB 275 ensures there is no confusion
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
with this uh principle spe specifically
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
the language clarifies that the governor
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
may use current laws to suspend rules or
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
regulations written by his or her
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
departments to adjust to an emergency
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
situation and potentially reallocate
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
resources between departments as the law
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
allows but by no means May the executive
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
make up new rules or regulations or
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
suspend laws without going through the
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislative process and he or she may
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
never suspend constitutional rights not
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
even the legislature can do that we
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
elect the legislature of 425 men and
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
women 24 sorry precisely because we dis
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
agree on how best to manage the state
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it is in that disagreement and
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
compromise that we come up with a sound
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
policy that is suitable for the most
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
people ideally that policy creates a
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
rule of law that governs everyone
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
equally so that even the minority is
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
protected by it as this process has been
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
thwarted over the past year we have seen
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
one man and his team of Executives craft
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
policy that may uh or may not take
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
everything else into consideration and
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
whether the policy has been Sounder or
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
not it has not been properly vetted
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
under the Constitutional system that we
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
have set up to make sure that it is we
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
have to stop this from continuing and we
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to prevent this from happening
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
again thus the governor should not have
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to extend a state of
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
emergency not even once after 21 days
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature if not the whole state
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to to get up to
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
speed on what is actually happening and
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
make an informed judgment as to whether
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
the emergency persists on top of
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
enabling this the bill also provides
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
metrics for measuring what the state of
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
emergency actually consists of and
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
conditions that would be needed to end
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
it which creates a bright line for
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
call um the bill lows provides metrics
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
for measuring what the state of
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
emergency actually consists of and
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
conditions that would be needed to end
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
it which creates a bright line for
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
policy makers to use as they judge
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not to continue it if the
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
whole legislature can't meet because the
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
emergency truly is that bad then the
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
executive Council unanimously may choose
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
to continue the state of emergency to
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
enable emergency measures to continue
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
and yes uh representative Schmidt I do
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
believe that one executive counselor in
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
his wisdom and judgment should be able
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
to stop a state of emergency from
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
happening as it is right now we have one
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
governor who's making that judgment and
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think he's making the wrong one and so
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
I do believe he needs a check on his
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
authority to ensure that it's truly
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
impossible for the legislature to meet
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
under this provision the poison pill is
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
added removing tax revenue from the
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
state and from cities and towns which
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
will motivate the legislature to get
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
back together and do the job it was
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
elected to do for the people of the
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
state as soon as conceivably possible
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
ideally the legislature should be making
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
policy decisions at all times and the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
executive ought to be enforcing those
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
policies the situation that lasts longer
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
than 42 days cannot possibly still be an
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
emergency that requires abandonment of
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional process and the
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
Republic that was set up to defend the
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
people's ability to govern themselves
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
even in the worst of times the idea
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
behind the changes proposed by HB 275
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
are that the people should always be in
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
charge of their government through their
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
legislature and they also ought to keep
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
autonomy over their own lives property
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
and businesses I urge you to pass it
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
though I acknowledge that many of the
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
great ideas and the other bills before
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
you also present solutions to the
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
problems I've highlighted and I do trust
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
you as a committee will amend one or two
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills to incorporate the best
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
ideas to strengthen the legislature's
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
role in handling future states of
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
emergency into a bill that becomes law I
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
do want to address a few of the things
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
that have come up in
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
conversation um you know briefly that
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
ends my testimony which I have submitted
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
to you by email uh um the First
 
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
Responders forcing people out of their
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
home or
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
businesses um I would I would submit to
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
you that under a true
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
emergency uh a reasonable person is
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to listen to the authority figure
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
and leave that scene upon
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
request um however if that person does
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
not choose to leave that scene they they
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
have an awfully good reason for it and
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
by there there should be no force in any
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
situation whatsoever where a person is
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
required ired by the government at the
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
point of a gun to leave their own
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
property that is just wrong and it's
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
unamerican the uh the second thing is a
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
nominal State of Emergency the the purp
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the the term nominal is is uh you
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
know not the right term to use and I
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome your your suggestions
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
to amend that term but um the point of
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
it was that sometimes a state of
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
emergency um leads to a a different type
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
of state of emergency which can be
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
Financial um in the instance of covid-19
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
in particular um it was the governor's
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
response to covid-19 that actually
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
caused the real emergency and now we do
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
have some Financial emergency that
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
requires Federal funding to keep us uh
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
in in a state of um you know solvency if
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
you will and and that is the state of
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
emergency so maybe it's a Financial
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
State of Emergency if you want to use
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
those terms but the point of the matter
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that the governor ought not to have
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
the power to craft emergency orders and
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that is the problem that we're
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
attempting to address he should not be
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
governing the state and also writing the
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
state's laws it is the legislator's job
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
to to craft state laws and if the laws
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
are not sufficient it is your job to
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
change them um whether uh someone also
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
brought up urgency of the state of
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
emergency in the executive having I
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was the gentleman from nashwa
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the urgency of having the ability to
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
respond in Rapid format in the
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislature's slow response time um I
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that after 21 days
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
there is no reason that the House and
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
Senate could not get together and pass a
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
house concurrent resolution or even just
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
a house resolution that gives guidance
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
to the executive department on how to
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
proceed in including extending the state
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
of emergency under the uh conditions
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
that are outlined in our bill HB 275
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's a critically important section of
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill um in in in terms of uh you
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
know an obligation to protect or
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I believe uh uh it was either
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative goalie or O'Brien who
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
brought this up um there are there is
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
several uh case law um including US
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions that indicate
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
that there is no duty to protect
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um it is simply uh a matter
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
of law
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we have provided this service
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
however it is not an obligation of our
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
First Responders to protect the people
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is the people's uh obligation to
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
protect themselves and they do that at
 
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
their own voluntary uh you know M mind
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
with using their own voluntary decisions
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
and wisdom and if they want to follow
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
the guidance of the state because the
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
state does have uh some ability to
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
accumulate wisdom uh and and and
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
expertise in the form of our First
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
Responders then is their right to do
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
that as well but for those who do not
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
want to follow the guidance it is their
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
right not to and I would submit to you
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
that at the point of a gun you've
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
created a mini War where um someone who
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to leave their house is
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
going to die one way or the other
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's from the disaster itself or
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
from being shot by the first responder
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to uh be flippant with
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
that comment but that's what you're
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually doing if you take your argument
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
to the point of its conclusion so I
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
would argue to you that all interaction
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
should be volunt in a free society and
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
that is the point of this bill is to
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
restore voluntary interactions as well
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
as to restore power to the legislature
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
where it ought to be thank you ladies
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen Representatives I
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
time representative scitech has a
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
question I have just one question Mr
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
manuse um if the legislature can end the
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
state of emergency at any time by
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
resolution why do you think they're
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I I suppose that's a question for the
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
424 members when they decide to vote on
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um I I do know that hcr2 is
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
being heard today in a different
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee I've already testified on that
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative sitech and I I testified
 
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
representative sitech and I I testified
in

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
favor um as I'm sure you could assume um
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it is well pass due time for
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature to do just that
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh but the point of these bills all of
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
the ones I've mentioned here is not to
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
end the state of emergency it is but to
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
protect uh the state in the future so
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
that when there is another situation
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
that warrants a state of emergency to be
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
called that there are added checks and
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
balances to make sure that one man does
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
not have ultimate power and authority to
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
do whatever he wants perhaps this one
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
man who happens to be our governor right
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
now has made wise decisions and I'm not
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
going to begrudge him or even get into
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
his decisions on this matter maybe you
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
agree representative citac that he has
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
made good decisions um I don't know
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
whether you have you do or don't but
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's neither here nor there the point
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the matter is that one man should not
 
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
have that role and Authority that power
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
has been vested in an elected
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
legislature which represents the people
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
of this state and it is the people of
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
themselves

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.070 align:start position:0%
themselves
representative

01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%

01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
Shuan Madam chair um representative
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
testified she mentioned that you and she
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
basically wrote the language of House
 
01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.790 align:start position:0%
basically wrote the language of House

01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
not well that's a very easy question to
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
answer representative Shu I am not a
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
representative uh I'm just a man who uh
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm happy to answer any
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill because of
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
that thank you are you not my
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
error I was a representative in 2011 and
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
12 that thought I remembered the
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
name um Madam chair I do have one other
 
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.310 align:start position:0%
name um Madam chair I do have one other
question

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
um Mr manuse uh you you mentioned that
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
you felt that uh the executive powers
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the governor is enacting uh have
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
been shown to be an abuse of power um
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
but would you not say that the
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
overwhelming electoral support that the
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
governor received in the midst of this
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic while we were all handling
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
these emergency pow shows that the vast
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
majority of the citizens of New
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire felt that the governor was not
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
abusing his power thank you um that's a
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
really great question representative Shu
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate it um part of
 
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
the question is political and I if you
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
want my opinion please ask in a followup
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to provide my opinion of
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
why the governor was reelected but it's
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
a political question and I don't think
 
01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:50.030 align:start position:0%
a political question and I don't think
it's

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
Germain um but I do want to you know
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
explain that we don't live in a
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
democracy where the majority rules or
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
the most praised or popular idea wins
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
the day uh we live in a republic uh and
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
even the best ideas ought to be vetted
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
and held up to the standard of law
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
written into the Constitution to ensure
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the majority's rights are protected
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you an example if 99
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
people of a 100 think that one person's
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
land that he purchased and developed
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
under the law is better suited to
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
another private purpose
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't matter we have a
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision that we
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
actually passed fairly recently that
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits that majority from taking the
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
land because that one person has a right
 
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
to the land the point of the example is
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we have laws in the state that you
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
may have even helped WR yourself and
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
these laws are being disregarded right
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
now by our executive and they shouldn't
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
be the Constitution makes clear that
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
only the legislature or the people have
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
the authority to suspend or create laws
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
the governor and other executive branch
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
officials don't have have this Authority
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
in a state of emergency they still don't
 
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
have that Authority yet they've claimed
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
it so what I'm asking you to do uh is to
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
do what is right under the rule of law
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
and under our Republican form of
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
government and and you know clarify RSA
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
445 to indicate to this Governor or any
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
other Governor that comes after him that
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have the authority to suspend
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that they don't have
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to authority to suspend
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
laws or make new ones and that that
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
power is vested only in the legislature
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
which is what the Constitution says but
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
I do believe it needs to be clarified
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
and and because of the testimony of
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
Representative blasic that she made
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
earlier it's very clear that it does
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to be clarified uh particularly
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
following the Benford ruling um so that
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
is uh that is what we're asking you to
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
do as a legislature as our
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
representatives of the the people at
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
you representative fno you have a
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um and
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just a
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a quick follow up on the same
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
question I had asked representative
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
luckus on the previous bill is that on
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
the section of compel versus recommended
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh for evacuation you kind of indicated
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we may see a situation where First
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
Responders are shooting um people for
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
not evacuating do you know or do you
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
have an example of where that may have
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
occurred in the past that that would
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%
indicate this is a problem we need to
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
deal with representative Fort new I hope
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
I pronounced your name correctly um I
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question um the the
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
comment was made in uh hyperbole
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
intended to show that if you take the
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
um the law as it's written to its
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
logical conclusion you're forcing
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
someone out of their home or business
 
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
force is you know ultimately results at
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
the end of a point of a gun um if
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
someone is not willing to comply with
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
that Force um so while I don't know of
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
that ever happening I do know that it is
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
a person's right to stay in their home
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
if they so choose and the government
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
should not force them to leave and
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's the point of this
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
provision thank
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you thank you
 
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:39.639 align:start position:0%
you all right no one else has signed up
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
to speak on house
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
275 414 yes sorry that case we will move
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
on to House Bill 4117 and I call
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
me can you hear me there you are yep can
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
you hear
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
me yes representative Roy we can hear MC
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um so uh hello
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues um I'm introducing House Bill
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
417 um
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill is a little different than
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
the ones we've heard discussed over the
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
last hour or so I too think that there
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be some revamping of
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
the of the governor's U powers during
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
this but what I don't want to do um is
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
get down into the weeds um the governor
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
is the executive and ero the manager and
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
and the legislature I don't think has a
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
position um as management we can't mic
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
micromanage emergencies so what I've
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
done in this bill is I've if the
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
governor still has the same powers to
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency matter of
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
fact I've extended it to 30 days and he
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
can renew that state of emergency and
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
I've left alone the ability of the house
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the Senate through concurrent
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
resolution to terminate it but if he
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
extends the state of emergency he has to
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
come to the
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and he has to get our
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
approval for executive orders that are
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
issued after that point
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that allow the flexibility for him to
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
do what he needs to do in emergent
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
situations and it also gives us the
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
oversight to look at these executive
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
orders now I've put a provision in there
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
that says if we can't for some reason
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
get together within three days the
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
executive orders in state of emergency
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'll extend for 14-day increments until
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
we can manage to get together I put
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
something in there where the governor
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
has to help us out and if there's a
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
natural disaster where the roads are
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
closed or washed out um he has to use
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
his ability and be it state troopers or
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
what have you to help us get to the
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to help out in this um and I
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
left it a simple majority of the house
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
to make it less complicated um if we had
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
put the House and Senate it would have
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
been much more complicated I put a
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the house president voting
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
no super majorities I just feel like
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
once you get past that 30 days and the
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
nature of the emergency is such that
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to continue the people do
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
have a right to have their voice heard
 
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.350 align:start position:0%
have a right to have their voice heard
um

01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
so if we look at the number of emergency
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
orders that been existed um or issued
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
under this emergency the people have had
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely no say in them um we just
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
have to take them and it is what it is I
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
think that at a certain point these
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
emergency orders become laws I mean
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
literally the executive is governing um
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
with one branch and has been for a
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
year um and that's not to criticize him
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
or or his orders or whether to second
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
guess or judge the this is prospective
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
looking forward do we want to end up in
 
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
a situation like this again where we
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
have one branch of Governor government
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
running state for a year um and I think
 
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is clearly no we have
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
a duty it's our job to get in there and
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually work with the executive on
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
these things so um I'll I'll keep it
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
short at that and I'm happy to take
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Roy
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes I have a question yes
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid thank you madam
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
chair so thank you for talking to us
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
Terry about your feelings on this uh so
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
the without getting into it into a
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
debate with you uh you say the the
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
governor is running the state that's
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
what the executive branch does it runs
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
the state uh but and and and I'd like
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
you to to disagree with that if you if
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
you don't see it that way uh but uh his
 
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation you referred to is
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
strictly to implement his executive
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
orders which are legal under the under
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the statute so uh and is it really
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
workable the idea that in the legis that
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature is going to come back in
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're only in session from January
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
until June roughly okay the rest of the
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
year we're not in session how do we get
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
session ordinarily the governor calls us
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
into special session so uh most of the
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
time year for year there is no uh
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislature there to uh no house there
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
in order
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
to do this resolution that you're
 
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
proposing how workable is your Solution
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Schmid
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
your first question I agree the
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
Governor's job is to run the state um
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
and by run the state in the reference
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
that I used he's running the state um
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
he's he's taking over two branches of
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
the three of government he's passing
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
executive um orders that have the effect
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
of Law and you know within a short
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
period of time that's reasonable when
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
you start getting into years which we're
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
about to cross over um I think it's you
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
know at some point we have to say hey
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay um we need to come back now as for
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
your second part question the the
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
governor would have to call us back as
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
it as is written in that in that uh in
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill um so that we could
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
opine on this and weigh in and work with
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
him on on future executive orders so I
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
think it's entirely feasible um
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
especially if there were a state of
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
emergency like this for us to come back
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I believe it it especially
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
seeing as I left it to a majority of
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
President voting and not you know the
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
have to assemble the entire 400 person
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
body depending on what type of emergency
 
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
it was that may not be feasible but at
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
least get the people's I mean the the
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
People's most direct representatives are
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
us um so if if the majority of us agrees
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
with the governor then we can be assured
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
that the majority of the state agrees
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the governor and that's not to to
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
compared to you know um his polling or
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
or how he did in the election it's
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
directly gerain to whatever the
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
executive order is because our
 
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
constituent will reach out to us and we
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
will be their voice I hope that answers
 
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.149 align:start position:0%
will be their voice I hope that answers
your

01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
question I thank you for your position
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you have a
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
question yes Madam chair thank you good
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
morning representative Roy um just
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
curious uh following up sort of with
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
what you just said that uh just a
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
majority of the house would have to do
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
this but um under this current pandemic
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
we could not even get back into the
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
state house and it took quite some time
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
for the means to get even a majority of
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
us to be able to have a place to meet um
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
and how do you feel that plays against
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
the needs of dealing with an emergency
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
situation thank you representative Shu
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's an important point which is why
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I included in there an automatic
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
extension if we were unable to meet in
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
14-day increments so that we would have
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
time to figure out how to do this how to
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
get together um you know without without
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
getting into the politics of whether or
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
not we should or should be meeting where
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
we should be meeting or
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
how the governor can extend these in
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
14-day increments until we can get back
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
together now if we can't figure out a
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
way to get back together in three months
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
he will just continue extending the
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
14-day increments and so be it um but
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
the goal is that we should have we
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
should have a an impetus to get back and
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do this to to help him
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh manage you know the state and the
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
people's business so I would I would I I
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
was very careful not to limit his
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
ability to deal with emergencies because
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
of us but I was trying to do is make
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
sure we had a way to be aart and have a
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
table thank you representative legro
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
morning representative Ro thank you for
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um isn't the uh the
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
fact that we can't be in the state house
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh having limited having
 
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
and uh having limited having
difficulties

01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
communicating in fact a direct uh result
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the governor's
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
orders and uh is there anything that
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
could prevent the governor under current
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
statute from just saying I'm
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
suspending uh the house uh
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
deliberations he also an
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
emergency um thank you theoretically um
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it would end up at the state
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court in about an hour but
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically he could um and you are
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
correct that the reason that we uh
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
originally did not return to reps Hall
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
is because of the governor's emergency
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
order that dictated how many people
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
could be where and and there's also the
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
the the obvious Public Health aspect of
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
it um but but you're correct but which
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
is why I was very careful to give him
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
that initial 30 days so that he can
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
react on his feet and he can do what he
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
um but after 30 days I think that we
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
should be able to get in there and U
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to do
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
it yes I will say that we the house did
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
in fact meet within 60 days after the
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
start of
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
the for the first session at
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
un follow question follow and and just
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the the
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
attentive this can very quickly devolve
 
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
into just a political exercise for
 
01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.550 align:start position:0%
into just a political exercise for
instance

01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
um in any given state or at least in
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
this state the state uh Supreme Court uh
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
justice I'm sorry
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice of the state supreme
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
court is recent political appoint by
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
Coincidence of this Governor so it
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
worries me that this could rapidly
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
devolve into a political
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
situation is this a further reason why
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
the state legislature the
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people should at
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
some point be involved
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
Absol absolutely thank you for the
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
question um it it should be involved to
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
take the politics out of it um you know
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
as I said we being the 400 member body
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
are the most direct representatives of
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
the people in allowing us to have a um
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
ability to input and approve or
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
disapprove of these things that are
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
directly going to impact our
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
constituents lives um is the most
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional way to handle um
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
something that on its faces is
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so um it's a it's a
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
conundrum and I tried as best as I could
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
to walk a thin line to give that
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
executive the ability to respond with
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
still allowing us to say the people
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I just I want a
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
clarification on something you just said
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
did you did you stti that the governor
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
could tell the Speaker of the House the
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house could not hold or
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
call the body into
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
session um I I think I preface that by
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
saying theoretically I think I don't
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
think there's a theoretical here I think
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
that the separation of powers are pretty
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
clear the Speaker of the House can call
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
the house into session when that speaker
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
chooses answer the question thank you
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative um it does say that the
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
loss is a lot of other things too that
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
that have been that have been waved um
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that's why I said theoretically um
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
theoretically the Speaker of the House
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
can do whatever the Speaker of the House
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
wants is's a separate entity um having
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
said that it also says that the
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
legislature shall make laws and right
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
now the executive is making laws so um
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
it comes down to again a fine line and
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that was I would suppose a a
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question by the
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative taking the argument to
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know ad of serum almost but um when
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
you're talking about unlimited
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
unfettered power that so far has not
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
been checked by us or the court um you
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
know I guess you get into the the
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
question of where will it end or what
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
Broda thank you madam chair good morning
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative Roy morning represent so
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
um the executive orders of the governor
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
has will no longer be viable once the
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
restive orders are rescinded
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
correct um do you mean once the
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
emergency state of emergency has res
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
sended yes that is
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
correct so these are not really laws
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
they are they're not permanent laws
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
correct um well I I I guess you start
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
getting into relative questions about
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
how long how long at what point do they
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
become laws if the state of emergency
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
goes on another year and it's now two
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
years are they still law are they still
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
just orders or are they laws I mean it's
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
a relative question um I imagine the
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
people that have to live under them
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
during the duration of the emergency
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
order will pretty much feel their laws
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
especially if they're fined or
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for violating one of them
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I I your point is taken that at some
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
point one would presume they will
 
01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.589 align:start position:0%
point one would presume they will
eventually

01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
expire thank you representative
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt we thank you madam chairman so
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
but isn't it the case that that all
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
these bills that we're hearing this
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
morning are basically strictly in
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
response to the extraordinary
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance of the pandemic which is
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
lasting uh far beyond what a what a
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
snowstorm a fire or even a flood would
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
impose on the state and its citizens or
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
a particular part of the state and and
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it's very contentious with regard to
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh what the actual reality of the
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic is uh the people on the right
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
tend to say this is a a hoax uh The
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
Masks don't work uh and uh our freedom
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
our freedoms are being taken away from
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
rep yes representative Schmidt I would
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
hope you hope you do not broad brush
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
large portions of the
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
state what is your
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
question the question is is this this
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
not these these bills that we're hearing
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
this morning are they not all in
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
response to the emergency situation that
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
exists right now because of the pandemic
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is an extraordinary circumstance
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
which we have not seen in a hundred
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
years uh the all the other kinds of
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
emergencies are over are over and done
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
with in a very short period of time um
 
01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
and there's no question about it it's
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a contentious political issue
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
right now regardless of how you want to
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
characterize it with regard to how
 
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
people believe but go into the stores
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that overwhelmingly
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
everybody's wearing a mask in the cities
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
at at the very least I answer the
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
question okay so
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to still that down to it
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're asking is Would we
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
not be writing these bills were it not
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
for the nature of this pandemic versus a
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
regular emergency and the answer is
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
actually yes um but what this has done
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
has showed us what can happen with the
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
law as written um I don't believe that
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's any U indication that we won't
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
have another pandemic or that something
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
like this couldn't happen again so it's
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
best that we prepared for it I believe
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I've been very careful not to
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
critique any of the actions or take a
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
position on on the on the validity or
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
worthiness of any of the executive
 
01:42:16.199 --> 01:42:17.709 align:start position:0%
worthiness of any of the executive
orders

01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:42:17.719 --> 01:42:19.350 align:start position:0%
orders
but

01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
prospectively should another uh you know
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
let's say this one ends next month and
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
then in December some type of new virus
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
shows up or a bacteria or what have you
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
we should be um prepared to assist and
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
do our role as a co- branch of
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
government and not once again turn the
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
keys over to the executive and say you
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
know do what you got to do for however
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
long it takes so there's a definitely a
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
political aspect as is every every piece
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
of legislation we do but I'm try to make
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
make this bill as apolitical as possible
 
01:42:56.669 --> 01:42:56.679 align:start position:0%
um and you know it by leaving it up to
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
majority the house that's the most
 
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative you're going to get of
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
the people in the state regardless of
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
their party so be it a republican
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
Democrat Governor majority not majority
 
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's just about representatives of the
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
people okay I appreciate you taking a
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
position on this representative
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
sht thank you madam chair um
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative just uh extrapolating
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
what you've been
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
saying um would it be my understanding
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
that the lawsuit that the legislature
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
tried to early on in this pandemic to
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
have the governor uh particularly take
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
some of his financial decisions through
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
the house fiscal committee was um an
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate um method to try and have
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature in
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I really can't and won't aine on
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
on any litigation that happened but I
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
can tell you that that would not have
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
been necessary had this statute been
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
enacted because um he would have had to
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature to U pass any
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
orders that had to do with financial
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
situations after 30 days so it would
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy for taking my
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
question uh one quick question if it's
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a truly representative bill
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
should it not be both the House and
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
house and thank you for the question I I
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
tried to um you're correct in that it
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
could be more representative uh by
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
adding the Senate it could be more
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative by adding the executive
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh Council um we could even included I
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
suppose a Justice of the Supreme Court
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
um but I tried to make this as narrow as
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
possible to streamline it and keep his
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
ability to keep things flowing um
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
without getting two different political
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
bodies involved in it to have to agree
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
or disagree a simple up or down vote I
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
felt um would move along quicker and it
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be more decisive um should the
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
commune it's in its wisdom decide that
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate needs to be included um I
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object that the Senate however
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
I left that alone where the only way to
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
end the state of emergency is concurrent
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
with the House and Senate they are still
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that but as far as the
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
day-to-day executive orders I felt that
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
it would be a much more streamlined
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
process to have one body to
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you my just thought in that was
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate have to pass
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislation together in order to get it
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
to the governor's desk that they should
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
both be included when they do
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
this your point is well taken
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative Roy would you can you
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
hear me now yeah that's better thank you
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
uh would you object to having the Senate
 
01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
added in um you know there is previous
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
speaker was correct that normally the
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
Senate's involved in
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
passing well practical matter I'm a
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
little concerned how the Senate would
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
view this bill we're cutting them out
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I fully anticipated they would
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
have added themselves back in anyway so
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to add them back in um
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
it was no slight to The Honorable
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
Senators it was as I said a a a well to
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
address the first point agreed the
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
legisl uh the legislature and the Senate
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
House and Senate have to work together
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
to pass laws these aren't laws these are
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
executive orders that need the approval
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
so I I differentiated it a little bit
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
there it is a little bit different
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
because if you think about it kind of a
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
an odd situation where the executive
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
would be writing a law that we would
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
have to pass versus US writing a law
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
that he would have to sign so um again
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to add them back I would not
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
object to that at all I did that for
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
only are there other questions for
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
representative Rock come on I'm on a
 
01:47:13.719 --> 01:47:15.270 align:start position:0%

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.510 align:start position:0%
 
hand

01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
ra okay seeing
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
none that case we are I will close the
 
01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.709 align:start position:0%
none that case we are I will close the
public

03:28:34.030 --> 03:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's 1:30 so we're in a full committee
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
work session on these bills and I have a
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
point of an area that hasn't been
 
03:28:43.189 --> 03:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussed yet that I'd like to bring to
 
03:28:43.199 --> 03:28:44.229 align:start position:0%
discussed yet that I'd like to bring to
your

03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
attention one of the things that
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
bothered me about the state of emergency
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
was that the governor declared it and
 
03:28:53.790 --> 03:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
said we have
 
03:28:58.030 --> 03:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
to uh take preventive actions to flatten
 
03:29:00.750 --> 03:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
the curve and prevent our hospitals from
 
03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
being overwhelmed which makes sense the
 
03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
time but then as time went on he kept
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
changing why he needed to continue the
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
state of
 
03:29:16.030 --> 03:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
emergency and I thought that was rather
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
disconcerting you
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
know uh one of these bills I think it's
 
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
274 has language that says that the
 
03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
Declaration of the state of
 
03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
emergency has to
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
specify what conditions are necessary to
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
extend the state of emergency and I
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
think that's a very important factor
 
03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:42.269 align:start position:0%
think that's a very important factor
because

03:29:42.269 --> 03:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know if we have an emergency because
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're likely to get
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
our um you know hospitals are likely to
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
get flooded with with cases well okay we
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
have an emergency
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
but you know 21 days later it's we're
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
having the same emergency for a
 
03:30:03.150 --> 03:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
different reason that just struck me as
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
as wrong and I wanted to bring that
 
03:30:05.680 --> 03:30:10.030 align:start position:0%
as wrong and I wanted to bring that
point

03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:14.610 align:start position:0%
 
up

03:30:14.610 --> 03:30:14.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:23.229 --> 03:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes yes if I may um I'll
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
just point out that I think when
 
03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative sh but represent leus was
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
recognized first oh I'm sorry I couldn't
 
03:30:30.479 --> 03:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
recognized first oh I'm sorry I couldn't
hear

03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
hear
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
him as I think said
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
earlier Works session process so I don't
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
know if at this point we should just
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.469 --> 03:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
with to
 
03:30:47.479 --> 03:30:49.790 align:start position:0%
with to
bring

03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
bring
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
separate I I think I can't hardly hear
 
03:30:57.790 --> 03:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
him he's breaking up is that better yes
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's better I guess I need to get
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
closer um I agree with um with
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's point the
 
03:31:09.389 --> 03:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
chair's point I was going to say is all
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
these bills and my bill 414 is kind of
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
separate I think but of the actual state
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
of emergency bills um I think the one
 
03:31:21.309 --> 03:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of uh cleanest one I don't
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
think there's a real problem with in my
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
view is
 
03:31:28.910 --> 03:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
433 and so might want to think about um
 
03:31:30.670 --> 03:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
taking other things we might feel are
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
necessary such as uh this addition of U
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
44 part one e the conditions necessary
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe tack them onto here
 
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
um and 433 is the main idea is that the
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
governor can do a 21-day state of
 
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
emergency and one extension
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
only um it says unless the clerk of
 
03:31:54.030 --> 03:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
either chamber of the legislature and
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
assistant clerk pursuant to RSA 44 as
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
certified within the past seven days
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
basically that that know it's it's not
 
03:32:07.189 --> 03:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
possible to have a session of the of the
 
03:32:07.199 --> 03:32:08.990 align:start position:0%
possible to have a session of the of the
legislature

03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
um and and um but unless the legislature
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
really can't meet then you know the
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has to extend it after in
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
effect 42
 
03:32:23.550 --> 03:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
days I like that idea because um while
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature can end the state of
 
03:32:26.590 --> 03:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
emergency I think there's a real
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
Temptation for various reasons to just
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know abdicate the legislator
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
abdicating its responsibility sitting
 
03:32:35.870 --> 03:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
back and letting the governor do it and
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
as represents the people I think that if
 
03:32:38.910 --> 03:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
possible um at you know after after the
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
first bit of the emergency the uh the
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
legislature really needs to get
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
followed show
 
03:32:52.750 --> 03:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you madam chair um I was just
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to point out uh with reference to
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
your statement of one reason and one
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
reason only for a state of
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
emergency I think in this particular
 
03:33:07.229 --> 03:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
case when it
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
first no one could have foreseen the
 
03:33:14.710 --> 03:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
length of time that this disease was
 
03:33:18.910 --> 03:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
going to insert itself into our lives
 
03:33:23.229 --> 03:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
and as we saw later on uh October and
 
03:33:26.590 --> 03:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
November of last year actually did
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
almost overrun our hospitals the number
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
of cases increased so greatly uh I can
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
see with something that's longterm such
 
03:33:39.710 --> 03:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
as this that the reasons that you need
 
03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
the emergency could easily
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
change and to be honest the executive
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
branch is probably better equipped to
 
03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
adapt to those changes than the
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
legislative branch would be that's my
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
opinion thank
 
03:33:56.080 --> 03:33:58.910 align:start position:0%
opinion thank
you

03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
schelz thank you madam chair um I still
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
need to read through the bills some more
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sad that I'm because of my bill
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
presentation and other committee that I
 
03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
didn't hear all of the testimon on all
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
the bills but I felt one bill might come
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
close to what I had hoped when I heard
 
03:34:20.670 --> 03:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
that Republicans were considering
 
03:34:25.150 --> 03:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
bringing forth uh concerns over the um
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
executive orders from the governor
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
because there certainly is a point of
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
agreement if we can find the right way
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
to get to that H in a bipartisan way I
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
think that uh maybe not all Democrats
 
03:34:42.510 --> 03:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
but I I suspect many Democrats will um
 
03:34:45.790 --> 03:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
support a certain way of addressing this
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it's HB 417 I certainly think
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Roy's presentation
 
03:34:54.510 --> 03:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
appealed to me and I think you have at
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
least one Democrat as a co-sponsor that
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative Vil is representative Sue
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
Vil from uh
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
NASA um I think
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
that I do think it so let me just
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
outline just some thoughts that I have
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
around that in with the hopes that it
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
will help whatever amendments or however
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
we focus this as we go at least for my
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
point of view as one of the Democrats I
 
03:35:21.279 --> 03:35:22.510 align:start position:0%
point of view as one of the Democrats I
think

03:35:22.510 --> 03:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
that executive orders for a year is uh
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
excessive I think that we've been in
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
session should have um brought us back
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
to a mode of cooperating as three
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
coinkle branches of government
 
03:35:44.110 --> 03:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
I think we could have done that a long
 
03:35:47.070 --> 03:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
time ago uh through special sessions and
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
I think that would have been the right
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
way to go I feel um there has been quite
 
03:35:54.150 --> 03:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
a bit of
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
overreach and I think to my
 
03:36:00.790 --> 03:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
constituents Republican or Democrat the
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
governor has seemed
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
to um and this isn't a disparagement
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
this is just uh why I think we'll come
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
to an agreement as Democrats and
 
03:36:11.309 --> 03:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
Republicans in the
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislature um I feel it seems like
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
through the governor's presentations on
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
W and from his press conferences he has
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
a unique ability to seem to appeal to
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
folks that usually differ on big issues
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
around covid but when you drill it down
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
for example just the mask issue alone
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
even retailers are frustrated from folks
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
who agree with my point of view on masks
 
03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
that they're there isn't really any
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
teeth to it on the other side I hear
 
03:36:48.269 --> 03:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
some arguments of people who disagree
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
with me and my view on masks that make
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
actually some interesting arguments that
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
are frustrating for all of us I think
 
03:36:58.590 --> 03:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
that bringing
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
Clarity to this debate around how New
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire responds to covid to the
 
03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
federal Finance piece to what is
 
03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
actually needed with that money
 
03:37:13.189 --> 03:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think the latitude that the governor
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
has used has been too broad it has been
 
03:37:17.439 --> 03:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
has used has been too broad it has been
um

03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
often uh in my
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
opinion uh even the Gopher committee
 
03:37:26.710 --> 03:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
that has some legislative uh
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
representation many of their
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations have gone ignored I
 
03:37:33.229 --> 03:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
think if the legislature could have
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
played a role fairly quickly we could
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
have prevented a lot of these
 
03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties and um for businesses for
 
03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
sure for General citizens for how we
 
03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
just function as a society I think there
 
03:37:51.389 --> 03:37:51.399 align:start position:0%
have been breakdowns and luckily not so
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
much of a breakdown that it's been utter
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
chaos but I think
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
that I hope that we can find common
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
ground because at the root of this whole
 
03:38:04.110 --> 03:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
discussion is a broad reach of power
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
from one branch of government at the
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
expense of other branches of government
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
especially the legislative branch and I
 
03:38:14.429 --> 03:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more with that overall
 
03:38:16.750 --> 03:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope that people smarter than me
 
03:38:19.110 --> 03:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
on this committee can help us drill down
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
to those points where we do agree and I
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
think there are places where we're
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
definitely going to agree and perhaps HB
 
03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
417 is a good starting point I have a
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
lot of other thoughts but I'm not GNA
 
03:38:36.030 --> 03:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
say them all I'll let other people speak
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
save them for round two representative
 
03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:41.429 align:start position:0%
save them for round two representative
goalie

03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I will um
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
probably say some similar things as
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz just said because
 
03:38:52.349 --> 03:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
I think this
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
is where we are here is trying to make
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
the determination of
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
whether we need to talk about declaring
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and how long the
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
state of emergency is declared
 
03:39:04.319 --> 03:39:05.830 align:start position:0%
state of emergency is declared
for

03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
and differentiate that between that and
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
the executive orders that are declared
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
by the governor um I think we all
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
have um our opinions on the way we want
 
03:39:22.110 --> 03:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
to go with this um I
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
believe the governor having the right to
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
declare the state of emergency and given
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
those 21 days um and then the
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislature has their ability to if they
 
03:39:34.110 --> 03:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
no longer feel it is needed to resend
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
that uh emergency declaration by a
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution I think that
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
problem in my mind is taken care of the
 
03:39:45.070 --> 03:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
issues I have are with the executive
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
orders and I I think there needs to be
 
03:39:49.630 --> 03:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of accountability after a
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
certain time frame uh that needs to be
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
addressed and uh representative Roy's
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill goes in that direction I think with
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
some work um we could probably come to
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
some common ground and get there um
 
03:40:06.030 --> 03:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do um so those are the
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
few points I want to make that there is
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
the two different factors declaring the
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
state of in how long and I think the
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
oversight of the executive orders and
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
with that thank you m chair Madam chair
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
if I could I can't raise my hand because
 
03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-host oh uh thank you it
 
03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
is um I just wanted a a a point that
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me is you know we can
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
right now resend the state of emergency
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
if with the Senate and the house
 
03:40:38.670 --> 03:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
concurrent the problem is is that by
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
letting the executive orders go so long
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
to use a a kind of a tired term it's
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
become too big to fail if if we were to
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
just resend it right now that would
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
cause utter chaos because the executive
 
03:40:54.309 --> 03:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
orders have spiderweed into so many
 
03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of government and Civil Life
 
03:40:59.790 --> 03:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
that it would just be a disaster so I
 
03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
think that the that was my point in the
 
03:41:04.990 --> 03:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill I drafted was let's get ahead of
 
03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
these executive orders before they
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
become so much that you can't simply
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
just vote them out because if we were to
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
do that right now I I agree that it
 
03:41:16.189 --> 03:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
would be it would be
 
03:41:16.199 --> 03:41:19.510 align:start position:0%
would be it would be
bedum

03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh thank you madam chair um my
 
03:41:26.110 --> 03:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
question and in in looking at 417 which
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
is uh out of all of them is the one
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
probably I might like the best but the
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
other elephant in the room it seems to
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
be wanting the legislature to limit the
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
U the governor's ability to declare
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency but I got to ask
 
03:41:46.670 --> 03:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
the question what happens if it's a lot
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
in reverse that let's say in the example
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic that we had a govern
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
governor who did not believe in face
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
masks who did not believe in Social
 
03:42:00.269 --> 03:42:00.279 align:start position:0%
distancing who did not believe in some
 
03:42:04.189 --> 03:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations by some of our
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
local Board of Health or uh the CDC from
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government so while we're
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
while we open up the can of tuner on
 
03:42:17.550 --> 03:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
this should we basically look at it to
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
empower the legislator legislature
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
itself to be able to declare a state of
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
emergency I believe it is
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
already okay thank you mad Chief because
 
03:42:32.189 --> 03:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
that I did not see in the bill but
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it didn't exist I just
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
didn't say it and was unaware yeah it's
 
03:42:39.229 --> 03:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
not in the bill it's in the statute the
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
on the bill it just shows the amendments
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the statute plus I think that we
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
could um we could literally just pass
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
laws and if we had to override a veto
 
03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:49.469 align:start position:0%
laws and if we had to override a veto
too

03:42:49.469 --> 03:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:42:52.110 --> 03:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for the clarification
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so um I I
 
03:43:02.710 --> 03:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
do think that it's not at all
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for us to uh to work on
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
something I don't think frankly that any
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
of the bills are ready to be uh
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
passed into law at this point uh but but
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
I do think that representative Roy's
 
03:43:20.309 --> 03:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
Bill provides a you know a structure
 
03:43:23.950 --> 03:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
that we could look at to to address some
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
of the issues that are out there we
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
we've already addressed uh in this
 
03:43:33.389 --> 03:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
Colley we're having now some um some uh
 
03:43:35.469 --> 03:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
grievances that the Democrats had with
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
regard and possibly some Republicans as
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
well with the the governor's uh know
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
decision to ignore the joint fiscal
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
committee um and create his own U you
 
03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
know toothless uh committee to uh to
 
03:43:53.229 --> 03:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
advise him I don't know if he adopted
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
any of their recommendations but they
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have any power to to enforce
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
anything anyway so uh as where whereas
 
03:44:03.309 --> 03:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
The Joint fiscal committee which is has
 
03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of managing cash flow
 
03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the for the state's expenditures
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
in the vium they have the expertise the
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
background and and the experience um uh
 
03:44:18.030 --> 03:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
so that that certainly irked a lot of
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
Democrats and uh and the lawsuit
 
03:44:25.950 --> 03:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh failed uh but uh the
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of dissatisfaction with
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
among certain Republicans anyway with
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
regard to the um you know the the
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
executive orders being an overreach and
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
banning a freedom of assembly and
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
violating the Constitution so forth and
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
so on uh so looking at the scope and the
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
breadth of uh of the governor's
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
executive order uh uh process and
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
procedure and the the fundamental aspect
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
of how far it can go um is something
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
that I think we could appropriately and
 
03:45:05.550 --> 03:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
constructively productively do uh in our
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh the other bills I think are
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
either unworkable or unwise or both um
 
03:45:16.149 --> 03:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
and so I wouldn't support any of them
 
03:45:18.910 --> 03:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
but I do think that uh that this is
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
something that that we have a
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility and enough experience on
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
the committee to to do something
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
productive with so that's my opening
 
03:45:27.720 --> 03:45:28.830 align:start position:0%
productive with so that's my opening
Gambit

03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
Gambit
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah I I tend to to agree with
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
you in that we don't want to pass all
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
these bills what I was thinking about
 
03:45:42.429 --> 03:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
when I saw saw them was that we would
 
03:45:46.510 --> 03:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
take one and give it make a
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
simple a simple fix that we can agree on
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
and retain one to see how it works and
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
then let the others go go by the
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
wayside I mean the the question of
 
03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
evacuations came up three times I think
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
one one law about evacuations is
 
03:46:10.510 --> 03:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
plenty so uh yeah we
 
03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at what the
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
governor has what we've given the
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
governor the authority to do and what
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
he's how he's how he's used it and taken
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
it because I personally think that the
 
03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee probably should have
 
03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee probably should have
been

03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:46:24.960 --> 03:46:26.469 align:start position:0%
been
involved

03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.960 --> 03:46:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair Please Speak oh ter
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I was wondering perhaps um if if
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
not now sooner we should maybe do a
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
straw pool just to see where everybody
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
stands on which Bill we want to use as a
 
03:46:48.030 --> 03:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle to to set aside and go
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
forward well I had three suggestions of
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
yours and I'm okay with that so if
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
anybody has any uh I mean I I'm
 
03:46:59.710 --> 03:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I wrote the Bill but I'm I'm not
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily married to it either way but
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
I definitely while while one side could
 
03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
pass a bill I would not be happy doing
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to see um I'd like to see it
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
go forward with a message from both
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
parties that's fantastic I just want to
 
03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:14.590 align:start position:0%
parties that's fantastic I just want to
say

03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
that isn't it nice when we
 
03:47:21.870 --> 03:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
agree and actually I'm I'm I'm gonna
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
continue that because I initially
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
suggested uh starting with uh
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
433 because it's simple and
 
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward and we could add things
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
to it
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
however um I think youve convince me on
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
417 partly because it has the virtue of
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
dealing you know giving us the ability
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with individual emergency orders
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
and not having to have an All or Nothing
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
thing on on the state of emergency so I
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
think that's starting with 417 I'd be
 
03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:56.429 align:start position:0%
think that's starting with 417 I'd be
fine

03:47:56.429 --> 03:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
with I all around representative
 
03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
Schultz yeah I think another reason why
 
03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
and I please forgive me I don't think
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
anyone said this but I may have missed
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
it um I think one
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
another reason why I do think that that
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
rep royy bill is the best one is because
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh by focusing on the executive orders
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's no threat to whatever Federal
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
funding if I understand that whole
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
process correctly we can still
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
um we can still have that status it
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't make that status go away if I
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly and if we were
 
03:48:38.429 --> 03:48:38.439 align:start position:0%
to just repeal New Hampshire's
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
participation in an
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
emergency status um forgive me if I'm
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting the language wrong that that
 
03:48:48.910 --> 03:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
would mean we wouldn't have um the
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
protections we would need from uh the
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal government or you know help on
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines Etc that's too important of a
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
thing that focusing in on the executive
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
orders is the way we got a we finally
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
got a reply from the Department of
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
Safety on what F what the Federal
 
03:49:11.149 --> 03:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
impacts would be if we ended the state
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
of emergency and I hope you all read
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
that because it was it was shocking how
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
much Federal money is is coming into the
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
state based on the fact that we're in a
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.110 --> 03:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
emergency unemployment and
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
part I agree I I mean I'm not sure of
 
03:49:39.790 --> 03:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
what's really the case I've seen uh some
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
legal opinions which if I can get in
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
hard copy I'll for the committee that
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
said that that would be true if was just
 
03:49:49.229 --> 03:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
a state state of emergency but given
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's a federal state of emergency
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
Stafford act uh would make us eligible
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
for all of that anyway but I am not
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
completely certain however I take uh
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz's uh point that
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
if we did it this way and could deal
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
with the emergency orders um you know
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
individually then we wouldn't that
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a question at all which I'd
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
with one thing can't see us passing
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
anything that would be effective
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
immediately uh the word I've gotten is
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the governor is perfectly happy to
 
03:50:29.550 --> 03:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
have a a bill that changes the emergency
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
authorization after this em state of
 
03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
emergency is over and I think that's
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable you don't want to change the
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
rules however wrong they may have been
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
to start with in the middle of of an
 
03:50:45.790 --> 03:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
emergency well that I mean that
 
03:50:47.790 --> 03:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
certainly is something that that is
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
obvious to those of us who've been in
 
03:50:51.469 --> 03:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature for a while and that is
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
that nothing is going to happen
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
immediately because we can't do it just
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
as the house uh we're not going to have
 
03:51:00.550 --> 03:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
a session for a couple more weeks anyway
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh and then it would have Senate and so
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
forth so uh even presuming that the
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
Senate would buy into what the house had
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
done um it it is the governor you know
 
03:51:15.389 --> 03:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
probably has a veto uh uh pen ready to
 
03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
to strike it down but but nothing's
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen right away so and and
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
this this this whole effort to to attack
 
03:51:26.670 --> 03:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
the whole structure of emergency orders
 
03:51:29.309 --> 03:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
and and uh state of emergency and so
 
03:51:31.630 --> 03:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
forth is clearly the daughter of the
 
03:51:34.149 --> 03:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic situation we never had any
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
issues when the Cold River uh you know
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
tore out the center of alstate said and
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
the governor declared a special session
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
and state of emergency because that was
 
03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
a local uh temporary issue that could be
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
addressed locally and and virtually all
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
the other emergencies that we have dealt
 
03:51:56.110 --> 03:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
with in uh in our time in the
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislature have been either local or
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
Regional not Statewide or not long-term
 
03:52:04.590 --> 03:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
this is a unique situation and because
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
it represents a disease that none of us
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
have ever experienced in the world world
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
has never experienced before uh even
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
though it's similar to the to the 1918
 
03:52:19.630 --> 03:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
so-called Spanish Flu um which was a
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
unique disease as well uh and that was a
 
03:52:26.149 --> 03:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago so this we're we're in
 
03:52:28.830 --> 03:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
uncharted waters with regard to so many
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
aspects even to this day with
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
understanding all the aspects of covid
 
03:52:35.229 --> 03:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
and seeing the new variants come out
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
practically every 10 minutes uh so uh
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
but but the the emergency order aspect
 
03:52:48.309 --> 03:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
is something that we can
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
productively visit so I I'm totally in
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
favor of of retaining representative
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
Roy's Bill and uh and coming up be
 
03:52:58.720 --> 03:52:59.790 align:start position:0%
Roy's Bill and uh and coming up be
unanimous

03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
on well I think that the point of all
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
these bills coming in is that this is
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
the first extended emergency situation
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
we've had and so it tested all the
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the law that we passed
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
after 911 you know a one-week emergency
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
for a flood in alad or or a power an ice
 
03:53:26.830 --> 03:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
storm across the you know half state
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
right doesn't corn of issues that you
 
03:53:34.269 --> 03:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
get when you have almost a year and you
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
know and I remember well that the first
 
03:53:40.349 --> 03:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
month or so there wasn't much outcry or
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
concern it's only when the emergency
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
started being renewed again and again
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
and more things got tied into it that
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
there was more concern and
 
03:53:54.429 --> 03:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
unrest well and the lockdowns that
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
resulted from the emergency order began
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
to put uh small businesses out of
 
03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
business that was clearly something that
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
was no fault to those peoples whatsoever
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
and I frankly thought that that sununu's
 
03:54:09.790 --> 03:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
initial thing about essential and
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
non-essential was a quick way of getting
 
03:54:16.349 --> 03:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
at uh that aspect to some degree but I
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
thought that relatively soon it should
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
have gone to uh uh permitting businesses
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
to reopen if they and their customers
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
could operate safely and whether
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
something was was essential or not was
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
not a
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
sufficiently uh you know precise and and
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
productive res resolution that it would
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
have been better I mean I got a friend
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
who operates a fireworks store I mean
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
clearly not something is essential but
 
03:54:47.550 --> 03:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
could he operate it safely probably and
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
if he was then his business should not
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
have gone down the drain because uh it
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't an essential business and so I
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
think that that there are a lot of
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
things that we can improve if we work
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
together on this all right thank you
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to just make one more
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
point if I could Madam chair the um when
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
we we look at
 
03:55:10.950 --> 03:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at it from a a
 
03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
perspective of you know one person has
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know too much
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
power is also the the angle that one
 
03:55:19.750 --> 03:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
person it's a lawful lot of
 
03:55:22.349 --> 03:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I don't want to
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
second guess the governor because I I I
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that I'd do anything
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
different if I knew that you know every
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
death was going to be hung on my head um
 
03:55:32.149 --> 03:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
between 400 of us we've got broad
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
shoulders instead of one person having
 
03:55:36.510 --> 03:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for every decision
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
life and death for such a long period of
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
time so I think it's worth looking at
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
both angles that it's not just about
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
reigning in power it's about
 
03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:47.269 align:start position:0%
reigning in power it's about
Distributing

03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility Terry don't forget the
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
governor's got he's got commissioners of
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
safety commissioners of Health and Human
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
Services he's got a whole panoply the
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
whole AR Armada of state government is
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
at his disposal so I don't think he's
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
making these decisions all by himself
 
03:56:06.990 --> 03:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
although it comes down to him ultimately
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
well yeah but the the issue is is that
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
it'll be on his head regardless of who
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
helps him with the decision at the end
 
03:56:13.870 --> 03:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the day he's the one standing for
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
election and he'll be held accountable
 
03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:22.890 align:start position:0%
election and he'll be held accountable
represent

03:56:22.890 --> 03:56:22.900 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:22.900 --> 03:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
comie thank you I'm listening to what
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
everybody what everyone is saying and I
 
03:56:32.550 --> 03:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
guess the what I've been thinking is
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
what representative Schmid just said is
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't have
 
03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:41.030 align:start position:0%
that we don't have
the

03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
um expse or demand or not not demand we
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise or the the
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge that state agencies have and
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're not um they're not really at our
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
disposal so how would you know how would
 
03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
we as a state legisl how do you see this
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
happening as far as the state
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislature making a
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
decision well that's yeah the actually
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
the agencies do come and give us advice
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
in counsel uh you may not have noticed
 
03:57:13.279 --> 03:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
in counsel uh you may not have noticed
but

03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:57:17.710 --> 03:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
the uh parade of Commissioners through
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is always
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
impressive we've had Commissioners here
 
03:57:25.469 --> 03:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
talking about their departments and how
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
they want to run
 
03:57:31.469 --> 03:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
um if they care believe me they'll
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
they'll let they they'll make their
 
03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
opinion to
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
M but this would be presented to the
 
03:57:39.309 --> 03:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
entire house right there wouldn't this
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
these this these decisions wouldn't be
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
handed down to a particular committee it
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
would be decided in the house right but
 
03:57:50.950 --> 03:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that the Commissioners would
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
manage to make themselves known by
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
talking to their connections their uh to
 
03:57:59.830 --> 03:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
to leadership to other Representatives
 
03:58:02.429 --> 03:58:02.439 align:start position:0%
they know you know they all live in the
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
state I mean I had the commissioner of
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
administrative Services living in my
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
town for years when she wanted something
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
she made it very clear that she wanted
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
it yeah right I would think it would be
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the governor to make his
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
case to us so that we can make the case
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
to our constituents so if he wants an
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
executive order he needs to bring his
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
experts before us and explain the
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
situation and if we buy in then we we
 
03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
pass and explain it to our constituents
 
03:58:34.110 --> 03:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
through this whole thing things have
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
been happening and people call me like
 
03:58:37.229 --> 03:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
why did you do that and I'm like I have
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
got a comment yeah actually you beat me
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
to most of uh what I was going to say
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that we should assume
 
03:58:48.630 --> 03:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
that the governor is going to have
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
access to information that's going to be
 
03:58:52.510 --> 03:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
disallowed the legislature we should
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
have those same resources available to
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
us and the other thing I was going to
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
say is um maybe I'm saying what
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
everybody is already thinking and knows
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
but it seems that there's a lot of
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
agreement and that we need only to lay
 
03:59:10.349 --> 03:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
this out methodically in in a few steps
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
like the initial declaration and then
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know the length of time that
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
declaration is enforc then when is it
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
time for involvement for the legislature
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
which branches of the
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
legislature uh and um really thrilled to
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
see that there really is a lot of
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
agreement here um I even want to say
 
03:59:30.269 --> 03:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
agree I don't recall which bill it was
 
03:59:35.469 --> 03:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
but one of the bills provided for
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
essentially veto power for any of the
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch I mean executive
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee um I think that's doing the
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
same thing in a sense it's putting too
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
much power in one person's hand and
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
putting too much on one person's
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
shoulders and the last thing I'll say is
 
03:59:57.990 --> 03:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
um uh you know for the the involvement
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
in extending and improving Governor's
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
initial emergency declaration uh it's it
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
would be unique to New Hampshire it's
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's done that way or supposed to be
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
done that way in Michigan
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin uh Pennsylvania we saw all
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
those legal battles play out during the
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
course of this past year where they have
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
those Provisions already in
 
04:00:27.630 --> 04:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
Statue so I just think that if we took
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
it a piece at a
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
time and and we could plug in each piece
 
04:00:33.389 --> 04:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
at a time and come to an agreement on
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
one piece we'll we'll put the right
 
04:00:35.680 --> 04:00:37.309 align:start position:0%
one piece we'll we'll put the right
thing

04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
thing
together

04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
smoothly that's very funny
 
04:00:59.710 --> 04:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has his hand up
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
soed to
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
speak we're just coming to watch what
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
doesc welcome taking a field trip we
 
04:01:17.149 --> 04:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
have El we were supposed to be having
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
hearings from 1 to
 
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
3 and no one signed up No
 
04:01:23.080 --> 04:01:24.870 align:start position:0%
3 and no one signed up No
One

04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
One
 
04:01:27.790 --> 04:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
S I mean and basically what was your
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
attendance like this morning um
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
moderately low we had the four bills
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
that finished up just before noon there
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
were only a couple of members of the
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
public um and one and one representative
 
04:01:50.990 --> 04:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
Management emergency management manager
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
from NASA came and spoke to us he had
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
some specific issues that he brought to
 
04:01:59.720 --> 04:02:01.950 align:start position:0%
some specific issues that he brought to
our

04:02:01.950 --> 04:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
attention um so what I was going to say
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
is that uh while a number of these bills
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
address the
 
04:02:14.189 --> 04:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
um require the mandatory or optional
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
evacuation I would
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
suggest keeping that completely separate
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
from what we're doing around uh state of
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
emergency emergency orders and all of
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
that um we got a separate bill it's mine
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
414 and we can debate that and people
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
can vote how they want on that but I
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest leaving that completely
 
04:02:31.760 --> 04:02:32.830 align:start position:0%
would suggest leaving that completely
out

04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
of um you know whatever else we do
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
because I mean there is there's
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate disagreement on it I don't
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
think there's any need to to uh to Cloud
 
04:02:43.389 --> 04:02:43.399 align:start position:0%
the uh dealing with the state of
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
that and Madam chair I'd like to suggest
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
a strategy if this
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
helps uh if you could let representative
 
04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
Pearson Speak oh sorry yeah then we'll
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
get get back
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
to thank
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
you so for those of you on the committee
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
that are unaware I actually have a
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
master's degree in Emergency
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
Management how
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
convenient so um and I got it I was
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
involved in it before 911 so I've I was
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
in the very early days of the the
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
concept of of that being a
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
profession so one of the things
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
that we need to be very cautious
 
04:03:35.439 --> 04:03:37.070 align:start position:0%
that we need to be very cautious
of

04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
is losing sight of the
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
action now there seems to be very
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
little disagreement here
 
04:03:53.199 --> 04:03:54.790 align:start position:0%
little disagreement here
on

04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
what what fundamentally becomes a change
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
in status and I'll give you an
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
example in the fire service that that is
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
used all the time we we have a term
 
04:04:07.229 --> 04:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's called under control it's
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most misquoted terms
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
the media uses um people like to
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
especially on social media like to
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
invent what that term actually means it
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
does not mean the fire is out it means
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the forward progress of the fire
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
has stopped and the situation in front
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
of us is manageable with the resources
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
and and Personnel that we have to
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate the
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
problem now under under a state of
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
emergency at some
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
point you go from the level of emergency
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
management where that point
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
begins is solely dependent upon the
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
situation at
 
04:04:54.880 --> 04:04:57.429 align:start position:0%
situation at
hand

04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
and caution you know I looking at some
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
of these bills with the 21 days or the
 
04:05:03.120 --> 04:05:04.189 align:start position:0%
of these bills with the 21 days or the
30

04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
30
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
days realistically historically anyway
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
the the overwhelming amount of of
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
declarations that have occurred have
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
so those time frames really do fit you
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
know even with katr Katrina was probably
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
one of the better examples of of
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
something that went beyond 30 days and
 
04:05:26.000 --> 04:05:26.990 align:start position:0%
something that went beyond 30 days and
that

04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
was you know the the once in a in a
 
04:05:34.870 --> 04:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
storm but the situation now has changed
 
04:05:40.030 --> 04:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
that where where we have spent decades
 
04:05:44.910 --> 04:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
studying weather related emergencies and
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
things that come on in the framework of
 
04:05:52.110 --> 04:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
that the the health emergency aspect has
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
has put this into a skew a little
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
bit so I I have certainly agreed
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
that at some
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
point there needs to be collaboration
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a check
 
04:06:11.309 --> 04:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
there needs to be honestly maybe a step
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
back where where the legislative body
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
can look at this and say okay you know
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the the executive branch is you know
 
04:06:23.790 --> 04:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
spending 15 18 hours a day working on
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
this and sometimes you get kind of lost
 
04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
in amongst the trees here and certainly
 
04:06:32.110 --> 04:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
having the legislative branch step back
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
you know and and say hey we're looking
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
at the whole Forest here and this is you
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
know this is what we see that's a good
 
04:06:37.600 --> 04:06:39.189 align:start position:0%
know this is what we see that's a good
thing

04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
my what I just want to caution is us
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
overreaching this and losing the ability
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch to do what
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally it is set up to
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
do which is to to act as the chief
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
executive of the state so you know I've
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
looked at the the the four bills that
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
were presented unfortunately um
 
04:07:07.149 --> 04:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
representative Roy's bill I don't have
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
in print I'm kind of bouncing forward on
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
the general court website on that one
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and I think that there's definitely
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
some some good stuff here all four of
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
these bills by themselves are
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
problematic if they were just taking it
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
face value individually but but I think
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
realistically you know uh there's
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity here to to look
 
04:07:35.070 --> 04:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
at this not from the point of the
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic but from the point of hurricane
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
Roy or the white mous National Forest
 
04:07:44.429 --> 04:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
being on fire
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
or any of the other interesting things
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
that seem to happen here so I I applaud
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
the effort I like what I've been hearing
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
so far and and I think that it's going
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
to take some work within our committee
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
to to hammer this out what I also want
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
to caution though is that
 
04:08:07.389 --> 04:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
we we have four bills in front of us
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
that that are relatively similar I
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
suppose in stretch maybe with the
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
414 legie admin has a series of bills as
 
04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
well that are in front of them we are
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
not tackling all of these together we're
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
not tackling these as a
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
Cojo committee type of effort and
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Pearson I'd like to mention that uh five
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
members of legislative administration
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
had have come and joined us and they are
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
they're listening with great attention
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's that's fantastic
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
because my fear was that we would spend
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of time here
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
hammering through this only to
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
now have to rehash this or blend it with
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
what legie admin came up with with their
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
particular pieces of of legislation so I
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
I'm thankful that they're in the room
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh I look forward to you know
 
04:09:04.510 --> 04:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
the the ideas that are going to be
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
here I interested in your point that
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the actual
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
emergency and then a continue situation
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
because I think that's kind of where we
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
are and that's where we need to be
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
careful of our language because of the
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
federal money they're trying to give
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
us can you expound on that sure I mean
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know real realistically at at the
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
point we're at now you know we have um
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
we have wellestablished testing
 
04:09:39.309 --> 04:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
locations we have have well established
 
04:09:42.269 --> 04:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
though slightly being tweaked on the Fly
 
04:09:44.750 --> 04:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and expounded upon vaccine
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
distribution sites we have not modified
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
the concept of social distancing in
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
eight months we have not modified The
 
04:09:56.670 --> 04:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
Mask mandate in at least eight months
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
probably realistically almost a year so
 
04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
we are we are truly managing Co right
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
now we are not functioning in an
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
emergency fashion
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
that that took longer than I thought it
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
was going to mainly because the
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
information that we were getting from
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
fouchy was honestly be he was cont
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
contradicting himself every fifth day
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
and in a very fluid situation where
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting a lot of unknowns and a
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
lot of speculation and a lot of politics
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
all blended into one
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
thing we were not able to get a sense
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
of exactly what was going on quickly
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and but that being
 
04:10:47.149 --> 04:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
said the we are clearly Way Beyond the
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
point of the quote unquote emergency
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
aspect because we have a we we know what
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is we're where management functions
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
in the sense of the social distancing
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
and in the current
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
situation has shown to have effect and
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
you know we're just now we're just now
 
04:11:08.189 --> 04:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
functioning through the process of
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get through
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
this that in and of itself is where I
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
think the core argument here is in the
 
04:11:17.680 --> 04:11:20.389 align:start position:0%
think the core argument here is in the
sense

04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
that what is what is a logical point in
 
04:11:25.950 --> 04:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
time to say okay look we're really just
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
managing this emergency now we're not
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's not under under a an outof control
 
04:11:34.590 --> 04:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
sense or or a sense of of too many
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
unknown variables so in and I think
 
04:11:41.149 --> 04:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
clearly the legislature as a whole not
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
just the house the legislature as a
 
04:11:47.830 --> 04:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
whole really does have a heavy
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility in making sure that not
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
only there's not an overreach of the
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
executive branch but in the but also in
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
the sense of the management function of
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
said problem is also
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
being done in in a proper way and
 
04:12:05.550 --> 04:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we're never going to
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
have you know 424 us that are in loost
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
step on something for the most part
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
but you know I multiple calls with the
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
governor over this time period when I
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
was working with the National Guard on
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
things that needed to be tweaked and
 
04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
problems that we had and and you know
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
but again that wasn't really that really
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't an emergency aspect of it it
 
04:12:28.510 --> 04:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
really truly just was a management of
 
04:12:28.520 --> 04:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
really truly just was a management of
the

04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
problem so bar and Katrina weather
 
04:12:34.990 --> 04:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
related events have really never
 
04:12:37.870 --> 04:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
exceeded 30 days with with us even the
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
ice storm was not stretched that long
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
so so I think that I we can easily agree
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
on a on a time frame that that is
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
prudent it to the 90 90th percentile and
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
then you know Institute the necessary
 
04:12:56.600 --> 04:12:58.389 align:start position:0%
then you know Institute the necessary
oversight

04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:12:58.399 --> 04:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
oversight
and

04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
necessary or the ability to offer our
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
opinion if you will um into the process
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
you know once that once that initial
 
04:13:12.990 --> 04:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
expired if I made any sense at all to
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
you guys I have no idea what you just
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
said right thank you representative
 
04:13:20.119 --> 04:13:22.309 align:start position:0%
said right thank you representative
Schulz

04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
Schulz
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
then thank you very much Madam chair
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay here's my suggestion maybe
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is helpful um in
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing the bill and in listening to
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
all the testimony that I heard today I
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:13:40.349 --> 04:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
well one we can definitely start by
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing the bill line by line and do
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
informal straw polls on those and see
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
where we disagree but if whether we do
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
it before or after we could look at what
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
are the main points that the framework
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
of it should address and I'm going to
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
suggest just separate from Bill language
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
what those pieces of framework from my
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
point of view I think are and I think
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
this covers it I hope so the first
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
biggest piece of framework would be that
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure New Hampshire
 
04:14:14.790 --> 04:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
statute sort of divorces the handling of
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
a declaration of emergency in in the
 
04:14:20.189 --> 04:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
official Federal sense the state has to
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
declare one or the governor has to
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
declare one divorce that process from
 
04:14:26.189 --> 04:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
what executive
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
orders how that process works uh even
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
though they're triggered by the
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
emergency declaration so that we can
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
address the executive orders without
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
harming a declaration of emergency so
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
that would be one the second would be uh
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
then to what degree and at what point do
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
the executive orders then involve the
 
04:14:53.550 --> 04:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and three would be and
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
this is very parallel to what degree and
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
at what point does either the fiscal
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee and or Jael car uh interface
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
with our um you know play a role with
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
executive orders I think those are the
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
three main big
 
04:15:15.070 --> 04:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
points from my observation if there are
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
more that's fine but going through
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
417 line by line might it's not that
 
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
long I think it's only roughly about 20
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
lines and some of them are just you know
 
04:15:28.960 --> 04:15:30.910 align:start position:0%
lines and some of them are just you know
basic

04:15:30.910 --> 04:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
basic
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
language does that help yes thank
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
you wants to say something well just for
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
the sake of saying it I'm bring some
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
ants to the picnic I'm not on board for
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
any of this um I'll listen but this is a
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
lot like uh my second wife you're never
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
going to hear it it's not going to
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
happen all of this commotion has
 
04:15:55.109 --> 04:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
happened once in the republic since the
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
revolution this is like the United
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
Nations we're talking about something
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's never really going to come to
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
fruition if you want something I mean
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
after all we can resend the that the uh
 
04:16:10.510 --> 04:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that declaration that
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
exists I might go for 2third of the
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
Senate to have a quick Nimble body he
 
04:16:18.510 --> 04:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
gets out of control two-thirds of the
 
04:16:21.630 --> 04:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
Senate uh shuts him down you can't get
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the house probably uh just
 
04:16:27.309 --> 04:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
physically uh and that's about but I'll
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
listen to the sh I'll listen to the
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
commotion and throw a few Stones now and
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
then but uh it why what are we doing
 
04:16:39.149 --> 04:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thought that's good
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
point has a comment I think
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson brought a really
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
good uh I way to think about it to the
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
table and I have to disagree uh with
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative scitec because um you
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
know it it can happen it's actually
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
happening right here in this
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee and we're not talking about
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
right now ending the emergency order
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
what we're just talking about is is at
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
what point do we begin to manage it so
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're right I agree with you
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually 100% on on a chunk of what you
 
04:17:16.510 --> 04:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
said that uh no this isn't going to
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
happen if we're talking about ending an
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
emergency order especially now but but
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
the way we manage
 
04:17:27.630 --> 04:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
it after the initial declaration is I
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
think what the key point is
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have something to say
 
04:17:42.429 --> 04:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
say repr Hills um my I guess my only
 
04:17:42.439 --> 04:17:44.109 align:start position:0%
say repr Hills um my I guess my only
comment

04:17:44.109 --> 04:17:44.119 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:17:47.229 --> 04:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
um I've been kind of keeping it an eye
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the effective dates of the bills that
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have over at
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
Legette and and as a practical matter
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
the bills that we see and I'm assuming
 
04:17:58.510 --> 04:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
the ones that you
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
have would require the governor's
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
signature to to go into
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
effect and I don't see that happening um
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
at least on the bills we're talking
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
about so I I think we do have to
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
separate this emergency versus future
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
emergencies um and that's where the
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
defining line should be um because I
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
think I think if we need to work on
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
anything first it's it's these effective
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
dates um so that nothing really happens
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
till after you know I think that it's
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to say you know
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
effective 30 days after the termination
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the of the current state of
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.229 --> 04:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
2022 which certainly hope is after the
 
04:18:56.189 --> 04:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
effect right but yeah but I we're
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
not we're not looking at to say we want
 
04:19:01.830 --> 04:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
to examine the current state of
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
emergency we want to say in if a future
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
Governor were to declare state of
 
04:19:07.279 --> 04:19:09.870 align:start position:0%
Governor were to declare state of
emergency

04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
over whatever Spanish flu or whatever or
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be look
 
04:19:15.680 --> 04:19:16.950 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be look
considering

04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
considering
 
04:19:16.960 --> 04:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
considering
because

04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
um we could we could spend all day
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
governor chair point of order could you
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%

don't know them and I very good point

04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon is also here I noticed you
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.560 --> 04:20:20.349 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:20.359 --> 04:20:22.109 align:start position:0%
and
okay

04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:25.109 --> 04:20:25.119 align:start position:0%
um there were some discussions held with
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor actually this
 
04:20:30.910 --> 04:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
summer around this and uh you know as
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
you would expect he was strongly opposed
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
to any changes that would impact the
 
04:20:37.389 --> 04:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
current state of emergency
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
however he did say he was certainly open
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
to uh going along with uh you know some
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
changes to you know this 445 or other uh
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
statutes related to the emergency power
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not like he was uh completely
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to any of this no if I recall he
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
actually asked us please take it away he
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
said he'd be happy to but currently he
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
sense

04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
who's next any any comments from
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the I just feel like we're doing with
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
two separate things in the story I
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
think kind of touched on it there are
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
emergency orders that have to deal with
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
weather and they're very different in
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
kind from the present one that we find
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves in which have to do with
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
health related issues and so I think I'm
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of divide these things is
 
04:21:39.269 --> 04:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard come up with an approach
 
04:21:41.950 --> 04:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
that encapsulates both of those things
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm almost wondering if we need to
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
propose something that that addresses
 
04:21:49.109 --> 04:21:49.119 align:start position:0%
those two things in a different way well
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
one point may be that a 30-day period is
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
long enough for almost any weather
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
related incident and it's only
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
a a health related thing probably that
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
could go on
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
could go on
longer

04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.510 --> 04:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
I was basically uh gonna say that but
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
also regarding what representative
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
Pearson said you know the uh 417 as it's
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
written would let the governor declare
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and it extends it
 
04:22:25.389 --> 04:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 30 days uh but then it would
 
04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
kick in the provisions um that would get
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature involved in approving uh
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know anything further and I think
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
that would split you know the uh weather
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
related and that sort of thing could be
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
handled in the way it has been because
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
certainly within 30 days the case and
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to drag on longer
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
it is I think very important for the
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to take up its uh
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to get involved and this
 
04:22:55.000 --> 04:22:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:59.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
the um yeah there there's potentially
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
one or two one or two scenarios that I
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
can I can think of historically in New
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would would go a little
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
bit beyond the 30 days but but I assure
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
you in those scenarios there would be no
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
disagreement as to extension so I I
 
04:23:29.229 --> 04:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
don't really think that that puts us at
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
a um at a risk of a political bottleneck
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
certainly so the only other one we had
 
04:23:37.199 --> 04:23:38.870 align:start position:0%
certainly so the only other one we had
was

04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
um Governor
 
04:23:44.070 --> 04:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
hasson's opioid right yes but she didn't
 
04:23:46.030 --> 04:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
do much else except declare the state of
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
emergency and let it expire it was she
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
was not an activist governor on that
 
04:23:50.800 --> 04:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
was not an activist governor on that
that

04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
emergency yeah she Governor Hassen
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
declared the opioid crisis of emergency
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
and that that was the extent of her
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
involvement as far as I could
 
04:24:08.590 --> 04:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the other the other question I would
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
like to put on the table is somewhere
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
along the line there needs to
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
be some recognition of the ability of
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
the governor to it um to change in some
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
minor or major fashion his executive
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
order or his emergency order and start a
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
new one um so so how effective is that
 
04:24:38.520 --> 04:24:40.670 align:start position:0%
new one um so so how effective is that
21

04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
day initial initial period if if all he
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
needs to do is then change it in some
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
fashion to to Jin up another 21 days um
 
04:24:56.349 --> 04:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that's going to be
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
addressed as well that's a good question
 
04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't under 47 that that
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be possible he'd have to um
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
he'd have to bring each each one before
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
the house and if we amend it the Senate
 
04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
um so any new order he
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
did um has to come in other words 417
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't judge his decision to
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
make a state of emergency it judges his
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
executive orders so he could extend the
 
04:25:24.269 --> 04:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
state of emergency as much as he wants
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
he just can't do anything with it unless
 
04:25:29.970 --> 04:25:29.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.980 --> 04:25:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:36.309 --> 04:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
period uh thank you madam chair um I
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
guess I just I I'm in agreement with um
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
with retaining one of the bills 417 is
 
04:25:45.550 --> 04:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
fine uh you know to work at UH and talk
 
04:25:48.269 --> 04:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
further in the future one of the things
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
that I thought of is uh we've talked
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
exclusively of either health related or
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
weather related uh emergencies and we we
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
live in a part of the country where we
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have earthquakes or forest
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
fires to the extent they do other areas
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
so at least we at least at this time we
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
haven't um the other thing that we
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
always have a a possibility of and and
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
what I thought of during the talk about
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
evacuation orders is a catastrophic
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
event at the seab brook uh Nuclear
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
Station and that could turn in certainly
 
04:26:31.229 --> 04:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
to a state of emergency Andor evacuation
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
orders um in in that in that part of the
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
state at least so and I don't know you
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
know I guess depending on the extent
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
whether it would last more than 30 days
 
04:26:43.830 --> 04:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
but um just something else to consider
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
while we're looking at the overall
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
structure of the
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
Pearson I'm glad you mentioned cab Brook
 
04:27:01.229 --> 04:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
because in another lifetime I was
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
involved in the nuclear
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
business let let me assure you there are
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
very few things that exist right now
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
that terrify people more than the
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
concept of sebr having a
 
04:27:15.389 --> 04:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
problem um from a compliance
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint I can't think of any other
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
thing in the state that would render
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
more voluntary compliance than an
 
04:27:25.229 --> 04:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
incident at Seabrook I personally
 
04:27:25.239 --> 04:27:27.469 align:start position:0%
incident at Seabrook I personally
was

04:27:27.469 --> 04:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
lived I think I'm I was six miles dead
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
west of 3 Mile Island when that happened
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
so my family has a little bit of
 
04:27:37.149 --> 04:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
experience when it comes to dealing with
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
problems at nuclear power
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
plants the concept one of the things
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
that I have I have concerns about when
 
04:27:45.870 --> 04:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
it comes
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
to this idea of of 414 and the idea of
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
involuntary you know uh the ability to
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
choose not to
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
evacuate and I'm sure that
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative lanzera representative
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
goalie representative O'Brien will
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
certainly easily back me up on this I
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
have physically removed moved people out
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
of structures that were on
 
04:28:13.149 --> 04:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
fire that did not want to leave those
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
structures okay so I can I can tell you
 
04:28:22.109 --> 04:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
that the the general overall idea that
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
people would just generally do the smart
 
04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
and right thing shockingly does not
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
always hold true
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay the fact that someone would be
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
reluctant to to leave a building that
 
04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
was clearly on fire is not
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
a rational person has a really hard time
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
relating to that okay but we've done it
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
multip the M or fire department has done
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
it so many times it's not countable
 
04:28:47.309 --> 04:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
really truly
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
so you
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
know the the concept of of the the
 
04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
removal at the end of the gun
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
scenario there is really truly no way
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we saw this in Katrina there is
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
there is truly no way to put in a
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
provision to allow someone to to void
 
04:29:12.030 --> 04:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
themselves of their rights to
 
04:29:15.309 --> 04:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
assistance um you know we we don't I
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
can't contemplate a procedure for that I
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
can't contemplate a way that the
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services would be able to know
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
who was and wasn't who could verify what
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be the ability for someone to
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
change their mind I mean that that
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
exists under under a DNR a do not
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
resuscitate order has the ability to to
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
be changed and rescinded almost
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
instantly so I I just
 
04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't the this the whole concept of
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
this is just so massively
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
problematic and that completely ignores
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that folks that are in the
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
emergency services business as a general
 
04:30:01.229 --> 04:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
rule do not look at folks that are in a
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
dire situation and keep
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
walking that is against the nature of
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
people that are in that profession it is
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
not something that you could train into
 
04:30:11.560 --> 04:30:12.990 align:start position:0%
not something that you could train into
those

04:30:12.990 --> 04:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
people and it makes the entire concept
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
of this honestly impossible it it truly
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
does and I I just want to I want to
 
04:30:23.309 --> 04:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
reiterate that to the folks that are
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily familiar with
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
the Emergency
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
Services industry but
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
um I get the theory I suppose you have
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
the right to die in a hurricane if you
 
04:30:35.239 --> 04:30:37.389 align:start position:0%
the right to die in a hurricane if you
want

04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:30:41.550 --> 04:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
but to to tie in what First Responders
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
would would have to do with that is is
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
not something that can be practically
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
done so thank you okay pres
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
shels thank you um I will say I don't
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
know if I understand everything
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative peon has said just to be
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
honest about that I will say though if
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
part of what we're doing here is trying
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
to determine if this is
 
04:31:12.109 --> 04:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
even uh needed in the future
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh or fortunately since we
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
are a global uh Community now the
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
chances that we're going to have another
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic are significantly higher than
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
they were a hundred years ago and we
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
have been lucky and fortunate to have
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
dodged this kind of a
 
04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
bullet um sooner to be honest with you
 
04:31:35.960 --> 04:31:36.790 align:start position:0%
bullet um sooner to be honest with you
so

04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I believe we'll have uh
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
few less than a hundred years till we
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
get to the next pandemic
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and if that's the only
 
04:31:49.109 --> 04:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
thing holding us
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
back um because that's
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
indeterminable uh I think it's helpful
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
to do a bill and then I just wanted to
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
see no one said anything in response to
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
my suggestion of how we could then
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
structure the discussion on any specific
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
04:32:12.750 --> 04:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I do think going line by line at
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
the bill to start is good and then
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
looking at what is our framework then I
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
made that suggestion whether you do my
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion or someone's else I think it
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
would be helpful then to be more
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
concrete than will we ever need this
 
04:32:29.550 --> 04:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
again let's just assume we
 
04:32:31.630 --> 04:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
will Madam chair can we get a
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee maybe what's that have you
 
04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
entertained theide of a subcommittee to
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
kind of narrow this down uh yes I had
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
originally thought of a subcommittee but
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
right now um we're Limited in the number
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
of times we can meet um I suspect that
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
after crossover we will have more time
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
available and that's why I want to
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
retain one of these bills to work out
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
more of the details
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative Shu and then algro then
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair um yes I I um
 
04:33:14.910 --> 04:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
was actually going to suggest that
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh we should look at meeting as
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
a committee of the whole on this issue
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big issue with a lot of
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
different ideas so I offer that but what
 
04:33:30.750 --> 04:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
I was going to say is um talking about
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
long-term emergencies and as someone who
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
had has survived three major earthquakes
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
in Southern
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
California I can tell you all that I had
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
looked into the possibilities of
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
earthquakes in New Hampshire they don't
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
happen often but with the granite base
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
to our geology I have heard that if we
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
have a major earthquake it would be
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and I can tell you
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
firsthand the aftermath of a major
 
04:34:04.680 --> 04:34:05.910 align:start position:0%
firsthand the aftermath of a major
earthquake

04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
earthquake
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
leads you in several different
 
04:34:10.590 --> 04:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
directions the immediate response is
 
04:34:14.109 --> 04:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
taking care of people who are injured or
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
killed but then the next response is
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
those who are survivors are left with
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
either no infrastructure roads are
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
destroyed your access to food water and
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
electricity is
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
destroyed um just many many aspects that
 
04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
come up and the long-term going going
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
forward is not going to be solvable
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
within 30 days I can tell you that so I
 
04:34:45.629 --> 04:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
think looking at this particular thing
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
going forward we do need to consider the
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
you uh yes I I think we keep still keep
 
04:35:02.349 --> 04:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
on muddling the different subjects like
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
evacuation and um I wasn't going to
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
address evacuation even though I had it
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
in my notes but uh representative
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
Pearson compulsory versus non-compulsory
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
evacuation it's not only not improbable
 
04:35:19.629 --> 04:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
and undoable but it works and I speak as
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone who's lived through Hurricane
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
Katrina and countless evacuation orders
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
compulsory and
 
04:35:29.949 --> 04:35:29.959 align:start position:0%
non-compulsory people make their own
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
decision and I have to agree with you
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
that um a um an emergency worker will
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
tend to run towards the danger even if
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're not uh required to but that's
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
true of citizens as
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
well um so again i' I've lived through
 
04:35:51.789 --> 04:35:51.799 align:start position:0%
countless ordered
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
evacuations and in fact part of the core
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
problem that we're facing
 
04:36:01.709 --> 04:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
today are those very evacuation orders
 
04:36:04.590 --> 04:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
those those very emergency declaration
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
orders because what happens is people
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
become immune to them you know in in
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Texas Florida you get
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
countless screeching orders to evacuate
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
and what happens is people just say ah
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
the last 18 of them were just it was
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um and so there are times
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
when people should evacuate and they
 
04:36:28.590 --> 04:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
don't but the bottom line is is
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
people make their own decision uh out of
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
the goodness knows how many evacuation
 
04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
order as I was present for in that part
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
of the country we evacuated
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
twice I'm glad that we did but we
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
assessed it on our own as did our
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors we made the
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
decision on our own and we actually
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
wound up better for doing what we did
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
and as has been pointed out earlier in
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
the day regardless of what an emergency
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
worker or a regular citizen would do
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
whether they would run towards or away
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
from the danger even if they're not
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
required to regardless of that it's you
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
know once the governor says there's an
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
emergency and everybody knows is
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
emergency it's been declared at that
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
very same time the governor declares
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
whether evacuation is compulsory or
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
recommended so everyone who knows
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency knows the
 
04:37:27.869 --> 04:37:27.879 align:start position:0%
circumstances of evacuation
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
order and then that person's decision to
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
evacuate it doesn't take signing a paper
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
like was thrown out earlier in the day
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
how do we get people to acknowledge that
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to uh not evacuate do we
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
get them to sign a paper no their
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
presence in their
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
domicile is their answer to the world
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
I'm still here I've decided not to
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
evacuate I understand that you don't
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
have to come back and save me thank you
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
if you will but I understand you do not
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
have to so just leave me alone and let
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
me tend to my own amilies and my safety
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
and the protection of our property but
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
we keep muddling these different
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
subjects we really need to focus nothing
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
we've talked about today none of these
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
bills curtail the governor's ability to
 
04:38:20.029 --> 04:38:20.039 align:start position:0%
declare an emergency I don't I don't
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
think there's any inkling of that in any
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
of these bills I could be
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
mistaken so piece number one is in place
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
the governor gets to declare an
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
emergency then it just becomes an issue
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
of after X number of days how do we
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
manage it and if we take that
 
04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
methodically uh maybe using the uh some
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the ideas that representative Schulz
 
04:38:45.310 --> 04:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
suggested if we take that methodically
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
then we could move forward step by step
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
and putting together some some rational
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.150 --> 04:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
goie thank you madam
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair uh this is a question
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
I guess if we are in agreement that
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
something is going to be retained um the
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
discussion going on here some of it
 
04:39:10.830 --> 04:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
starting to sound more like a debate
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
that should be taking place during an
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
exec session um if this is a true work
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
session we should have a bill or two in
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
front of us and work on it line by line
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
um but if we're really looking at
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
entertaining I I think the best thing to
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
do is to figure out which Bill we want
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
to retain and which bills we want to
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
work on um so that work can be
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
accomplished because I and honest all
 
04:39:37.868 --> 04:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
honesty don't think this is really a
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
work session this is just more or less
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
debating the
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
bills just looking for a little
 
04:39:46.990 --> 04:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
Direction on this okay well in that case
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
how about saying that we will take house
 
04:39:49.760 --> 04:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
how about saying that we will take house
build

04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:39:55.990 --> 04:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
417 and use that as something
 
04:39:58.830 --> 04:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
to come forward
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
with language for this
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
year whether or not probably not perfect
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
but expressing some of the ideas we've
 
04:40:07.440 --> 04:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
but expressing some of the ideas we've
been

04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.840 --> 04:40:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
retain

04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
retain
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
separately House Bill 414 on evacuations
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
as I agree with black it's a totally
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
different subject we don't need to to
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
conflate that with the uh the
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
emergencies it's a totally separate
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
issue and take any reference to
 
04:40:35.300 --> 04:40:35.310 align:start position:0%
evacuations out of any of the others
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:44.590 align:start position:0%
evacuations out of any of the others
[Music]

04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
and deal separately probably rain and I
 
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
think um 275 is broader than 433 so
 
04:40:59.470 --> 04:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
that' be a better one to retain it's
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
more things would be gerin to
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.320 --> 04:41:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
does that make sense any violent
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
objections to
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm just a little confused um so
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
you want to retain 275 to work on what
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to do
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
47 I want to develop some amendments to
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
417 that will incorporate the ideas
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
we've discussed and semi agreed on um
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
days I want to add the Senate want to
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.550 --> 04:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
um specifically adding the Senate and
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
some of the other comments about
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh oversight on executive
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
orders as representative Schmidt said
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that's in our perview
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of mentioned in 417 so I
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
I would want to go home and and read
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
this very carefully and think about
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
where we need to
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
um where we would want to make changes
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
because it's got a lot of what we've
 
04:42:25.948 --> 04:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
been talking about that the governor
 
04:42:30.670 --> 04:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
declares the emergency for 30
 
04:42:30.680 --> 04:42:32.230 align:start position:0%
declares the emergency for 30
days

04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then the legislature has as the
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair yes uh Madam chair if um if we
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
work on
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
417 do we have until if I'm looking at
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
the rules correctly the deadlines do we
 
04:43:05.910 --> 04:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
have up until March
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
18th to decide that perhaps we don't
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
have it ready yet and we still um put
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
forward a retain motion up until that
 
04:43:19.868 --> 04:43:19.878 align:start position:0%
date uh up until the speaker was saying
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
this morning at the chair's meeting that
 
04:43:21.920 --> 04:43:23.190 align:start position:0%
this morning at the chair's meeting that
he's

04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
he's
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
contemplating changing some of the
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
deadlines because he wants to minimize
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
the number of sessions we
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
have so this will undoubtedly be exact
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
at the last possible
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
you madam share yes goie uh just a quick
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
question and
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
um would it not be better to give these
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
a thorough review by retaining
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the understanding uh in the
 
04:44:01.150 --> 04:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
discussion we had earlier that none of
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
this of the decisions we make now
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
are looking to make changes to the
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
current state of emergency so there is
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
something right now that we can give
 
04:44:18.190 --> 04:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
this a thorough vetting that it needs as
 
04:44:18.200 --> 04:44:19.110 align:start position:0%
this a thorough vetting that it needs as
a

04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh possibly you may be right
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand we don't know that
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
in the middle of May the White Mountain
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
National Forest is and going to burst
 
04:44:29.200 --> 04:44:30.030 align:start position:0%
National Forest is and going to burst
into

04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:44:32.430 --> 04:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
flames which is one of the scenarios
 
04:44:34.110 --> 04:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
that representative Pearson's brought up
 
04:44:37.150 --> 04:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
as being a major non-weather related
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
emergency that would need to might last
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
more than 30 days um so I I would like
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
to at least try to come up with
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
something on it um we can always retain
 
04:44:52.628 --> 04:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
it at the last minute yeah that was my
 
04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
point yes yeah we we'll we'll work on it
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
if we can't agree that it's got most of
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
what we want to as a framework for
 
04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:05.430 align:start position:0%
what we want to as a framework for
handling

04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
handling
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
longterm emergencies then we can retain
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
it then but I would kind of like to try
 
04:45:17.310 --> 04:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
something just wanted to uh answer kind
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
of a question from representative
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
Schultz about her framework um I I think
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
it off hand it looks good I haven't said
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
anything because uh I'd need to go
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
through the bill and think about it some
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
more to to to decide if those are the
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
right things if it needs to be anything
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
else which I couldn't do while listening
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
to everything else but U you know thanks
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
for at least starting
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair I appreciate that sorry
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to be a repository for um
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendments so if everyone wants to take
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
their time and read this and send and

04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
we can go over each possible Amendment
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
and vote it up or down that's a very
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
muted unmute Steve I was
 
04:46:19.470 --> 04:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
trying I'm trying to remember what the
 
04:46:24.430 --> 04:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
say okay got it this has to do with well
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
we I guess I'll address this to the the
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
chair of legie admin um what just
 
04:46:37.868 --> 04:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
left all right we got any backups in the
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
room doesn't look like
 
04:46:44.350 --> 04:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
it okay because we didn't discuss what
 
04:46:46.110 --> 04:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
any of their bills look like and if and
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
how they fit into the framework of our
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
bills yes very true we got to narrow it
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
down first if we can get one good one
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
and they can come up with one and maybe
 
04:46:56.520 --> 04:46:57.190 align:start position:0%
and they can come up with one and maybe
we

04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
can right now we got way too many things
 
04:46:59.558 --> 04:47:03.110 align:start position:0%
can right now we got way too many things
floating

04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.120 --> 04:47:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
around

04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:47:05.240 --> 04:47:08.750 align:start position:0%
around
okay

04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:11.070 --> 04:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
represent um my hand was up Peter
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt yours
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't um anyway sorry big deal then go
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
talk Jesus some kind of a game no so if
 
04:47:24.788 --> 04:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly during your
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on your bill representative
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
Roy um you mentioned there were a few
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
states that correct me if I'm wrong but
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
I think you mentioned some States that
 
04:47:38.430 --> 04:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
had actually gone to the effort of
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
introducing new rules or laws pertaining
 
04:47:46.270 --> 04:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
to the executive power Visa the
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
legislature do you remember which states
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
those were and because it might be
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to just on our own look
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
some of that up um that was not me and
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
it was not my bill um it wasn't of the
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
other ones I think I totally made that
 
04:48:01.868 --> 04:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
up sorry that's okay I believe the
 
04:48:03.628 --> 04:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
states mentioned were Michigan and
 
04:48:03.638 --> 04:48:05.788 align:start position:0%
states mentioned were Michigan and
wiscons

04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
wiscons
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
but in Pennsylvania
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes but this this may be long
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
existing thank
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
you all right well I'm noticing a lack
 
04:48:24.510 --> 04:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
of enthusiasm bubbling up um does anyone
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
else have something something to
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
add I just was going to say that one of
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
the bills that ledge Administration has
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
is uh House Bill
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
187 which deals primarily with the
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
Services and it's got several aspects of
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
it that are very problematical I believe
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
but that's one that I have taken a look
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
at I don't I don't know the other ones
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
and I haven't looked at them
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid are in lock House
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 187 passed the house last week and
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
is was sent to Edna we will be having a
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
session on it uh
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
possibly the 15th maybe
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
later we will into all of those all of
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
time got my knife
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
sharpened excellent excellent and your
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
and your and your
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
pen okay anyone else have important
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
issues Madame chairman can I interject
 
04:49:34.270 --> 04:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
briefly I just want to mention that I
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
sent around a a memo with all the bills
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
that went to um legislative
 
04:49:43.708 --> 04:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
Administration and Edna also Health and
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services where 187 started and um
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Judiciary I believe
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
also had some state of emergency bills
 
04:49:54.270 --> 04:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
so I summarize very briefly but
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
certainly there's a a single document
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
that you all have that that lists all
 
04:50:01.628 --> 04:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency bills and and um
 
04:50:04.548 --> 04:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
just a brief summary of each one
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
excellent as well as the history on of
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
the current state of emergency law which
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
I hope was helpful also thank you so
 
04:50:15.628 --> 04:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
going forward we will all read these
 
04:50:19.548 --> 04:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
bills again and think about them submit
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
suggested language changes to House Bill
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
417 to representative
 
04:50:26.600 --> 04:50:30.070 align:start position:0%
417 to representative
Roy

04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
and not worry about the other other oh
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 414 the
 
04:50:36.320 --> 04:50:39.390 align:start position:0%
house bill 414 the
evacuations

04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh I we
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
can try and execute or we can retain it
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
I think maybe retention might be better
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
think okay so we will uh retain 414 and
 
04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
probably 275 and itl 433 so I think
 
04:51:03.400 --> 04:51:06.750 align:start position:0%
probably 275 and itl 433 so I think
that's

04:51:06.750 --> 04:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
the narrowest of the bills and Madam
 
04:51:11.788 --> 04:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative
 
04:51:15.868 --> 04:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
goalie um I think when we exec 414 that
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
should be on the merits of itself
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
whether do you feel that
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
um you're absolutely
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
correct we should not because I can't I
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
can't agree to retaining it I just don't
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
agree with that policy
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
change policy
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
change 414 yes fine we
 
04:51:41.548 --> 04:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
it we consider what it on its merits
 
04:51:41.558 --> 04:51:43.868 align:start position:0%
it we consider what it on its merits
thank

04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
you I got the impression from what you
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
were saying Madam chair that uh that we
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
could kind of to some degree sit on one
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
on one or two of the these bills before
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
we have to make the for final decision
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
as to whether we're going to retain or
 
04:52:02.350 --> 04:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we do have a couple of weeks
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt but I think want
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
to focus our attention on
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
4117 because that seems to be the the
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
closest to what Mo most most of us
 
04:52:16.510 --> 04:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
want I agree if you have a section that
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
you think you have better language for
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
we we let's send it to representative uh
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
Roy and we'll consider how to arrange
 
04:52:25.440 --> 04:52:27.310 align:start position:0%
Roy and we'll consider how to arrange
those

04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions very good okay and we are
