00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
great yeah come on
 
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
so for the record Peter Bixby uh Dover
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Stratford 13 a ranking
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
member of House i e our last uh last
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
fall we did a study uh study committee
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
on soil conditioners and one of the
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
things that director Wyman uh spoke
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
about when he was testifying was that uh
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
they weren't actually able to test
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
fertilizer Beyond a couple of uh tests
 
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
that they did on complaint because their
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
staff time was so occupied with doing
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
data entry they receive all of their
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
registration forms which are quite there
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
are a lot of them and Licensing forms
 
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.409 align:start position:0%
are a lot of them and Licensing forms
um

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
on paper and then they enter them into
 
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets like 1980s style
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets uh and uh this obviously
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
wastes a lot of Staff time and uh the uh
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
the lack of Technology also makes it
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
more difficult for people who want to
 
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
interact with the Department you can't
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
just fill out a form online saying
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
please update my registration for x and
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
such fertilizer you have to fill it out
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
all on paper and mail it in uh and uh
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's you bad in terms of our
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
relationships with the public that we
 
00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
are uh uh working on regulating and the
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
idea behind fertilizer regulation is
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
that you want to make sure that if
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
someone says that they are providing say
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
5 10 5 on the label then you want to
 
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that it actually contains that
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
and you want to have a representative
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
sample that tested every year
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
so I initially wrote A bill that would
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
provide data processing for the
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
um for the fertilizer statute and uh the
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
department came back and said actually
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
we have this problem in all of our
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
divisions and we should just have
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
something department-wide that will
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
allow us to do data data processing in a
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
manner consistent with it being in the
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
2020s rather than the on 1980s uh so
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
are they because we had we passed an the
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
animal database Bill a couple years ago
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
there's actually now an I.T person
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated to uh to the Department of
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and that person was able to
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
provide uh some numbers for what uh this
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
processing system would cost and also if
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
they go with the same vendor it will
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
create efficiencies uh so
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
um it looks like the cost is going to be
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
well last fall he quoted 360
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
000 uh the fiscal note says between 360
 
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780 align:start position:0%
and 500 000 and given the uh and then a
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
2002 2000 200 000 for
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
um every year for maintenance thereafter
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
that maintenance can be covered by
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
existing fees uh so uh what we just need
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
is the capital expense to get it started
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
and the return on investment for this is
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
going to be huge and basically we're
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to be saving several staff
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
positions by or or there would need we
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
there would need to be more staff
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
positions to actually execute the law if
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
this doesn't go through so um so it's a
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
basically it's a good
 
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:27.469 align:start position:0%
basically it's a good
um

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's a good investment and I'm happy to
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
no all right yes representative Griffin
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering it if you
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.150 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering it if you
can

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of federal money around
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
opco money and all the money around has
 
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
anybody done any research this seems
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
like the type thing that is agriculture
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the type thing where
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
you might just stumble onto a uh a
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
perfect fit with money that's already
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
been appropriated from the federal
 
00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
been appropriated from the federal
government

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
we haven't looked at that and because
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is really an operating expense I
 
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
think it would be a pretty low priority
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a Grant application uh so
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I so as far as I know it has not been
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
looked at I did mention it to the
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
governor and uh he sounded like he
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
thought that it was an interesting
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
problem and that we do have a budget
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
surplus at this point and that and I
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
know that the governor prefers to use
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
budget surpluses for one-time expenses
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
this this is a one-time expense so it
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative cameras thank you Mr
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
chair um you mentioned that uh it would
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
the if you got this it would prevent
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
having to hire additional staff would it
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
cut any in uh staff that exists today I
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that it would cause any
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
staff Cuts because essentially they
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
hired the staff so to be able to do
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
things like fertilizer assessment so
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
you're doing the determination of
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
whether there's actually the right
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
amount of nitrogen and potassium and Etc
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
in it so and to uh and also to be able
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
to work with the regulatory issues
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
around that uh and those staff are being
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
used simply for data entry now they
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
would be returned to doing what they're
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually supposed to be doing under the
 
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
actually supposed to be doing under the
law

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
I mean not uh representative
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
what happens if if one of these things
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
that says it's 10 nitrogen and it's only
 
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.350 align:start position:0%
that says it's 10 nitrogen and it's only
six

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
can you go and Trace them down in every
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
store that's selling this yes uh there
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
is a uh so the uh the fertilizer is
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
registered by the manufacturer and uh
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturer labels it with
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
what's supposed to be in it and the
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has a list of uh stores
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
that they sell to and or to or Farms
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
that they sell to if they sell directly
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
and there is a um
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure in law for what to
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
do about deficiencies uh the penalties
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
for those deficiencies have actually
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
just been or the pro that process has
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
just been updated by something we passed
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
um a couple of weeks ago so it isn't
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
just something that sits there and says
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
oh sorry they actually go and remove
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
these from right so distribution so the
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
so they remove it gets removed from
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
distribution and anyone who uh purchased
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
it is entitled to a refund under current
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
law if they purchased over a ton uh with
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed a few weeks ago
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be anybody
 
00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.509 align:start position:0%
is going to be anybody
okay

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
agricultural law somehow unique or is
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
this likely that some other state has
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
software that that would be adequate for
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
this purpose uh the
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
um so the the
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
software will be necessary uh would be
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
basically there there is a vendor that
 
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
that the department would work with
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
because it it's essentially it's going
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be everything that the department
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
does it's not it the vendor would not be
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
solving a new problem
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
but the but you but having a vendor is
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
going to be a much more cost effective
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
way of doing it than trying to do it
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
in-house with
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
um given our
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
the way that Tech it is set up in New
 
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.230 align:start position:0%
the way that Tech it is set up in New
Hampshire

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the the vendor is likely
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't know this for a fact but
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
this is going to be our RFP going out
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
the people who the vendors likely to be
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
responding to that RFP will be people
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
used to doing this sort of system and uh
 
00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:10.579 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of making sure that the
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about you know can
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
you feel a fill a form out online and
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
send it in and have it appear online in
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
in a workable manner in a database
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's specific to
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that's like
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you're aware
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for
 
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative so another thing about
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
this is that in terms of is is New
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unique in terms of the law
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
um there's a
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
National Organization that looks to
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
standardize laws in New Hampshire law is
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
so we have someone else here would like
 
00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:54.410 align:start position:0%
so we have someone else here would like
to

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
please state your name and spell it if
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's difficult thank you chairman
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
Maguire and thank you to all of you my
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
name is Sherry Gould I think that's
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward but s-a-g-r-ry
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
like the wine g-o-u-l-d and I represent
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District eight uh Warner
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
Bradford in hanager so um I'm here for
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee we heard the bill and
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
um we passed it uh overwhelmingly out
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it passed on the floor so this bill
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
will update the Department of
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
Agriculture from paper to online
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
procedures relieving employees who are
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
spending time on administrative data
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
entry freeing them for data collection
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
and verification will allow the
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
department to fulfill its required
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
duties more effectively the department
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
will move ahead with the support of the
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology to
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
contract development of an electronic
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
system that will replace some old and
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
unsupported data collection systems such
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
as the important weights and measures
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
data system and add the elements to
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
modernize the systems as the department
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
is funded by fees the costs associated
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
with the bill appeared to us to be
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable to remedy the tremendous need
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
fully recognizing and supporting that
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
you all decide the fiscal matter is we
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
decide the policy matters
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
I was particularly struck with the
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
commissioner's report that the weights
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
and measures data system was developed
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s by a prisoner who has since
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
been released and fulfilled his time and
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
so we have no support for that system
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
and it's failing and the commissioner
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
was concerned will it even last if we
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
get this put through so I think what
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby reported to you is
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
important but that's one just one piece
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
of the broader picture that's really
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
important and weights and measures
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
govern so much of our income for the
 
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.490 align:start position:0%
govern so much of our income for the
state

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that this is more than
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
just for fertilizer this is for all the
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
other operations in the department yes
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
yes everything and that's part of why
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
the contractor will be coordinating that
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
all with the I.T person who's embedded
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Agriculture was
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
there uh giving testimony to the
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
committee and he felt very confident
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
that the breadth and the need would be
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
covered that he understands the
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
processes better and that this should go
 
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
processes better and that this should go
well

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
let me just redirect him to
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you agree with what
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:10.010 align:start position:0%
 
way

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
please come back representative
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
and turn on your mic representative
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
are we still using
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
um individuals to uh private contractors
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
to check the measuring system as opposed
 
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.890 align:start position:0%
to check the measuring system as opposed
to

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
we used to have our own Department that
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
oversaw weights and measures how is that
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
accomplished that is uh that's done by
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
contract and so it does not it is that
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
it is done with contractors so so for
 
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.850 align:start position:0%
it is done with contractors so so for
instance

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
um for uh testing the um the accuracy of
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
gas pumps
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
um there are contractors who uh who are
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
who do that to do the testing and then
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is a auditing process that the
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
department has to make sure that they do
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
a spot check on uh the work that the
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
contractors have done and make sure that
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
they are doing that correctly and
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's no if I may and there's no
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
issues with um having this coordinating
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
this system with the contractor as
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to as opposed to what they have
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
now is that done in cooperation with
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
them or in conjunction with them or I uh
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
that the contractors would use for
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
reporting but I assume that the
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
contractors would be much happier to uh
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
just upload their information as opposed
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
to having to fill out a paid perform and
 
00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:57.620 align:start position:0%
send it in
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr chair you're
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
welcome all right thank you very much is
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
there anyone else here oh dude no okay
 
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:07.940 align:start position:0%
did anyone else here who would like to
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
weigh in on House Bill 230.
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
no okay so what do I do close the here
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
or we'd start talking discuss it maybe
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
any discussion um
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have agriculture coming in this
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon so we might want to talk about
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
it with the commissioner see whether we
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
should put it in his budget or what we'd
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could I make a general
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
comment we have a series of bills before
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
us most the reason they're here is they
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
all have a fiscal point
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking that um
 
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.450 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking that um
that

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
the economy may not be as healthy as
 
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:00.860 align:start position:0%
the governor anticipate it it is being
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had any feedback from
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means yet to my knowledge
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
so I hope that
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
we hold these bills until we have a
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
better feeling
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'll see we have 10 minutes you must
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:38.550 align:start position:0%
he didn't ask any questions
 
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:44.930 align:start position:0%
he didn't ask any questions
[Laughter]

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
but we're going to see him later yeah 2
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right we have 10 minutes
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
we got about two and a half I saw a lot
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
American time yeah so so representative
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
Sweeney asked about procedure so my
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
guess is if the bill looks right it
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't need any Amendment right then um
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
presumably and it's just about spending
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
money or not then then we would retain
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
it typically right and then when we get
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
to the to our our quote our numbers in
 
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
the budget right uh we did you know we
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
make a decision is this worthy to be
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
over the line and be funded or under the
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
line and not be funded right you know
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
where does this the importance of this
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
compared to everything else in the
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
budget right
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
um but if and and and and then assuming
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
we decide to fund it the numbers would
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
go into house bill one and the the body
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill will go into house bill too
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
right but if
 
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.590 align:start position:0%
right but if
um

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
let's say the bill itself
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
needed let's say like house bill 50
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
where we change the bill completely
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
right we changed it from spending money
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
in one way to spending money in another
 
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:33.860 align:start position:0%
way I would assume with a bill like that
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
we would send it back to the house in
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
the new form assuming the rest of the
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee likes it and then assuming the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
house passes it we would then ask the
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
house to table it at that moment right
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
after being passed and then we would
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
come back and do the same thing about
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
putting it in the budget or not you know
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
et cetera is that correct yeah yes
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
and you know it the point is normally we
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
know how much money we can spend before
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
we get the budget for some reason we
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
haven't found that figure yet
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
you know the the governor has all these
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
ambitious spending plans but
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
the revenue he shows is a little less
 
00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:16.610 align:start position:0%
the revenue he shows is a little less
so

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
I spoke to representative Sanborn the
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
other day and she said they're not even
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to be coming up with those numbers
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
until next week so it's like the end of
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
next week maybe or something like that
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
so represent Griffin if I can add
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
something for the newer members we never
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
know where we're going to be
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
and as we go through these departments
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
everybody should be looking for areas
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
that in a worst case scenario if we had
 
00:23:50.169 --> 00:23:50.179 align:start position:0%
to make cuts
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
looking for those areas that would be
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
logical cuts and keeping track of them
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
because I've been on the committee
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
before where at the end of the session
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
they say okay we've got to find 10
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
and you know if you if if if you're
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do it in retrospect it doesn't
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
work if if you've been keeping track
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
along the areas of the budget that are
 
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
along the areas of the budget that are
weak

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
weak
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
then you're in a position office and
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
I just learned today that house bill 2
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
is like 500 pages
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and most of it's oplc stuff
 
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.110 align:start position:0%
and most of it's oplc stuff
yeah

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
but no we don't have it yet another
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
point is when a bill comes to us well
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
supported it's past the house it's got a
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
good vote
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm reluctant to say no we're not going
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
to fund it you know especially if it's
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
small money like this it's under a
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
we can very likely something like this
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem but you know if
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
something comes in with a huge amount of
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
money that that's kind of a Target but
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
and especially if it's struggled to get
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
through the house but
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
we have to realize and there are other
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
things we can look at
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
like in the past
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
there was one that came to Western that
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
said we need to hire three more
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors to do something
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I would go to the committee and I'd
 
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.830 align:start position:0%
and I would go to the committee and I'd
say

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
are all the inspectors in this
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
department busy or can you change some
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
of them over to do this job rather than
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
hiring three new people isn't there some
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
place within the organization that you
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
don't need three people then we can
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
re-substitute them for this and it makes
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
it a lot easier but it's a conversation
 
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative evil right on time but we
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a few minutes
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
your written testimony was very good I
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
don't know if the members all saw that
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
or if you have printed copies for
 
00:26:01.260 --> 00:33:07.430 align:start position:0%
or if you have printed copies for
foreign

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up the work session on
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 300 as soon as representative
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
ebels finished passing out some earlier
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
written testimony we'll let her
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and uh and
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee members so
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
um you have before you
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
um HB 300 which just passed the house uh
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
on a Voice vote it was recommended uh
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
20-0 by the environment and agriculture
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
committee it has a great deal of
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
um it is a bill that attempts to get the
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire a little bit more
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
on track with its solid waste so what I
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
thought I would do is I'll um
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
I'll describe the bill but it's really
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.109 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
hard to fully uh to fully understand
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do unless I give
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of context which is
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
what I try to do in the written
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that I did for you
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
so basically what HB 300 would do it
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
would ban the generators of food waste
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
of one ton or more a week from disposing
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
the food waste in a landfill or an
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
incinerator but only if there was a
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
place that could handle the food waste
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles of the entity generating
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
the waist
 
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.609 align:start position:0%
the waist
um

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:12.170 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
the food waste generally would have to
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
be separated and the Order of preference
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
diverting it would be a reduction would
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
be to start out with trying to generate
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
less food waste in the beginning try to
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
get it out for human consumption try to
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
get it out for animals for farms and
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
then the last thing as appropriate you
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
could use it for composting you could
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
use it for anaerobic digestion or if
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate land application and then
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
you could also use it for energy
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
recovery the effective date would be two
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
years from now give or take on February
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
1st 2025
 
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.490 align:start position:0%
1st 2025
so

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.410 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
in updating my testimony I still say
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
here that it's a 50 mile radius that was
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
amended so it's a 20 mile radius so I
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
um per the EPA statistics it's it's uh
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and it is estimated that approximately
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
25 in weight of all the
 
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.380 align:start position:0%
um waste that we put into our landfills
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
is food waste and this
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
um one ton ban would be a really good
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
way of trying to get that waste out of
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
our landfills and also trying to get
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
food to the hungry so as a result of
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
this bill there's also been a great deal
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
of Interest among Food Bank folks and
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's also been a great deal of
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
Interest among businesses that are
 
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.020 align:start position:0%
interested in doing composting
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural folks who want to do
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
composting on their Farms this started
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
really for me this journey in 2019 when
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
you may recall the Chinese decided that
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to take our Plastics
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
and our mixed paper anymore and our
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities were really really
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
floundering on what to do with their
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
waste their um they were as you may know
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
the when when you dispose of your Solid
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
Waste when it goes to a landfill or an
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
incinerator you're paying a per ton
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
charge so the more waste you have
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
obviously the more your costs are going
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
to be for tipping fees so many of these
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
municipalities were faced with a
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
situation that instead of getting income
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
for their recyclables
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um through the the Chinese venue they
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
were floundering with respect to their
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
costs with um with increased tipping
 
00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:01.490 align:start position:0%
costs with um with increased tipping
fees

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
so I uh
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill and we had a
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee and we had
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
14 hearings in about I'd say six weeks
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
we had 50 stakeholders I tried to bring
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
in everybody from like everything that I
 
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.020 align:start position:0%
can think of from landfill operators
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
agricultural folks municipalities any
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
number of folks and I would say it
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
started sort of a voyage of Discovery
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
and understanding that we really haven't
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
been paying attention to our Solid Waste
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
situation in the state for decades
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
the long-range Solid Waste plan that we
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
had hadn't been updated since 2003 we
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
had diversion goals and when I talk
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
about diversion goals what I'm trying to
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
express is that you're trying to divert
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
the trash from going into the landfills
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
so our diversion goals went back to the
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
90s and they were supposed to be
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
achieved by 2000 they had not been
 
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.470 align:start position:0%
achieved by 2000 they had not been
updated

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
um uh in the situation with the
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities trying to deal with these
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
roiling Global markets
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
Des really wasn't able to support them
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
very much and so when we were sitting
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
there listening we found out that Des
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
used to have a planning department and
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
due to budget cuts they had no planning
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
department whatsoever anymore
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
and so they really weren't able to help
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
the towns they weren't able to help the
 
00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
the towns they weren't able to help the
state

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the solid waste Bureau had really
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
been I would say pretty much decimated
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
so basically our bipartisan group tried
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
to come up with several things to
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
achieve and I'm actually really pleased
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
with the progress that we've made
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
because if you look at this we're sort
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
of starting from the the ground up
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to rebuild the situation in the
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
state and the first thing we did was we
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
renewed and updated our Solid Waste
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
Disposal uh diversion goals and we're
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
going to try to achieve a 25 reduction
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
by 2030 and a 45 reduction by 2050 we do
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
have we passed a bill that put a
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
deadline on it and we do have a new
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
long-range Solid Waste Management plan
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
we created a solid waste working group
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
that would work hand in hand with des
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
and development of that plan I chair
 
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.990 align:start position:0%
and development of that plan I chair
that

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
um that group and through some
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
reorganization Within the solid waste
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau we do have a couple of folks that
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
are now helping with planning but
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that you know they help
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
with all the legislative support and
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and now they're going to be tasks
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
with making the solid waste plan a
 
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.089 align:start position:0%
with making the solid waste plan a
reality

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
but to make that uh plan a reality we
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
have to act on some of the goals that
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
are set forth in it and so uh to do that
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
it will take some investment by the
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
state to sort of come back from where we
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
were 30 years ago and this is all really
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
important because all our uh region the
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
Northeast region is very aggressively uh
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce what they're putting
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
into their landfills and um and taking
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
real bold action to try to do better and
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
basically we haven't done much of
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything for years except that we have
 
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.290 align:start position:0%
anything for years except that we have
landfills

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
um and some of the states are now
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
sending their trash to New Hampshire as
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
they progressively reduce the number of
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
landfills in their own State
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
I think you all know by now that under
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce clause there
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
really isn't any way to ban out of state
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
waste from coming into our state
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
but what we can do is do some things to
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
protect our our capacity for landfilling
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
and also do better with
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
um with solid waste so
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
in going through the goals of the solid
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
waste plan and trying to understand some
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit if you'll forgive the
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
phrase one of the things that we
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
identified that all the region is doing
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
is initiating a food waste ban for one
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
ton or more and I guess the only thing I
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
would other thing that I would add here
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
is that we do have other bands in place
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we have lived with we don't allow
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
for instance leaf and yard waste to go
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
into our into our landfills
 
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
into our into our landfills
um

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
I could talk about this for a really
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
long time but I just I want to add one
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
thing and that is that landfills when
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
they're permitted there's a lot more to
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
it but they are based on volume and so
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you go to a landfill you see
 
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.170 align:start position:0%
you know if you go to a landfill you see
these

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
machines with you know Wheels as high as
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
the ceiling and they're compacting
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
compacting and packing and
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're trying to preserve
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
your landfill capacity you should be
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
looking for things that make sense to
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
not put in landfills
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
that we can put far better use to so um
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the state you know landfills is the
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
least desirable way of dealing with our
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
um waste and I think in the long run we
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
um save money I can talk about landfill
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
leachate I can talk about toxic
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
chemicals I can talk about all those
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
things I think we have to recognize
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
whatever goes into a landfill it stays
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
there it's not busily degrading because
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's an anaerobic kind of a situation
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
but the water comes through the
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
landfills collect the leachate it goes
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
to our wastewater treatment plants we
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
can talk about pfas we can talk about
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
all the unbelievable amount of money
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with at the wastewater
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
treatment plant size so I'm trying to
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
change the conversation a little bit and
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get people to focus on where a
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
lot of this plate stuff is coming from
 
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.890 align:start position:0%
lot of this plate stuff is coming from
so

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to talk to the
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee about it
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative evil
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know
 
00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.470 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know
hmm

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
who would be the typical
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
business or
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
type entity that would be subject to
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
this in other words it's a restaurant
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
with 250
 
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
seeds generating that much waste would
 
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:08.780 align:start position:0%
they be subject to it is my local
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
supermarket subject to it
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
Etc well one of the ways
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that really helped me
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
personally Envision this I I talked to
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that collects food waste they
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
said it's
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
eight to ten
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
eight to ten 64 gallon totes that are
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
filled to capacity and they have
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
200 to 250 pounds per tote so that's
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
what a that's basically what a ton is
 
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.750 align:start position:0%
what a that's basically what a ton is
um

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the folks that would well first of
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
all I should say there was no objection
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
at the hearing nobody really came forth
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
I think it would involve hospitals it
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
would involve very large Grocers and it
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
could uh involve very large restaurants
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
the thing that I want to point out is
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
that this isn't like a cumulative thing
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
it's not like if there's a McDonald's if
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
they generate a ton
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
at 10 you know taken all together at 10
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants that's not what this is this
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
is individual generators
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so I talked to a Hannafords for
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
instance in my area and what they're
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
doing and this is an initiative that
 
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:32.300 align:start position:0%
comes from Maine
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hannaford has a contract with a company
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
called agricycle and agricycle runs an
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digester that produces energy
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
in Maine and they go around to all the
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
Hannafords they collect all the food
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
waste that goes into the totes
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
including packaged you know the the the
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
um the the grocery stores aren't
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
required to de-package their stuff
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
everything just gets dumped in and then
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
agricults it and then they take it to
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
Maine to um to run their their
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
digester and the other thing though that
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
I mean I I wasn't thinking about this
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
exactly sorry I'm stemming from I'm
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
veering from your question but the folks
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this say a grocery
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
store like Hannaford they're working
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
real you know they would work closely
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
with food banks and food banks are
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
really excited about this to get more
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
food to feed the hungry which let's face
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
it is where food should be going not
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm what I'm looking for is uh
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
statistics on how much food waste is
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
generated by different types of entities
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
and apparently you don't have any of
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
that well uh Des is here I'm not sure
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
what they what they have exactly
 
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.690 align:start position:0%
what they what they have exactly
statistically

00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
statistically
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
um what I can tell you and this isn't
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
exactly an answer to you but what I can
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
tell you is that Des estimated that
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 190 tons of food waste
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
could be diverted from our landfills if
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
this went into
 
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler thank you Mr
 
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.849 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler thank you Mr
chairman

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
so I've been making compost for decades
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I use a shredder
 
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
and when you put food waste in it
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of liquid in it and it
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
makes a mess if you don't mix something
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
in it so I always have a supply of
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
either Christmas tree branches or or dry
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
leaves and it and it comes out dry and
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
then I soak it and it composts very
 
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.870 align:start position:0%
then I soak it and it composts very
nicely

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
nicely
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at grocery stores which
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
create tons of cardboard
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
and if they shredded the cardboard and
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
then mixed that with the food waste so
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
that they could have something dry so
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
that the liquid would be absorbed and I
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
wonder if anybody has tried that as an
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
experiment I would think the the
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
cardboard shredded cardboard would be an
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
ideal thing and it's it's it's killed
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
two birds with one stone I wonder if
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
anybody's tried that as an experiment it
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
seems to me obvious with a grocery store
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I can't tell you exactly but I've
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
been in places where they have separate
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
bins for
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
compost and they tell you to put in Old
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
Kleenex and you know like
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
um paper towels and things like that and
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you know I can't speak for
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
an anaerobic digester operator but I I
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
would think that as an organic substance
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
paper products could be used in some way
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
and and they could be used to they they
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
generate electricity so it's really
 
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.030 align:start position:0%
generate electricity so it's really
um

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really nice meshing
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
between preserving our landfill capacity
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
doing better with food waste and also
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
providing business opportunities for
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
people who are really interested in this
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
sort of thing it's a and and I've talked
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
to Vermont and some of these other
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
states and things just sort of evolve
 
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.230 align:start position:0%
states and things just sort of evolve
together

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to point out that
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
someone you know if you were subject to
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
this ban as an institution unless there
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
was a recipient for the food waste
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles you wouldn't have to do
 
00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles you wouldn't have to do
it

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
coming to our community
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
happy to be here
 
00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:47.450 align:start position:0%
happy to be here
um

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
do you know how many tons per week of of
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
all waste is both generated in New
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and comes to New Hampshire for
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day I'm going to leave that
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
question to Des which is behind me what
 
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
I what I do know is what's going into
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
our landfills is approximately 2 million
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
tons annually and about half of that is
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
is out of state and just to clarify on
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
your vid on your Voyage of solid waste
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
with me there are private landfills in
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
the state and there are public landfills
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the state and public landfills can
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
either be owned Say by Nashua or they
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
can be a solid waste District that are
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
owned by multiple municipalities and
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's really the municipalities right to
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
you know they they limit it to the
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
people that they're serving private
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
companies can take their waste from
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
from us obviously but from out of state
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever so it's really the private
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
landfills that are the ones that are
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
mostly taking the out of state waste
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
so in my town we have mandatory
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
recycling so we separate out
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
aluminum tin cardboard paper
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
plastic and glass and then the rest is
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
trash right so when you say this could
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
say 2 million annually is that all those
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
categories or is that just the one that
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
I would call trash
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
well I don't think I would I said it
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
would save two million no no that's the
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:39.530 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm gonna see what Des says
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
about this so but when they're
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
calculating I think how much uh waste is
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
generated they're talking across all
 
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.809 align:start position:0%
generated they're talking across all
categories

00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:54.829 align:start position:0%
categories
um

00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
and then they have statistics that they
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
get on the different subsets
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
so a fiscal question yes
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
it shows one additional employee I
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
believe starting in 25 is there any
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
reason the Department of Environmental
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
Services didn't include this in their
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
budget why this is a standalone build
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I think when they were developing
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
their budget during the governor's phase
 
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
their budget during the governor's phase
um

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I have to be honest I'm not exactly
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure when that was but that was when the
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan it wasn't
 
00:53:42.609 --> 00:53:42.619 align:start position:0%
issued until November of 20
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
22 and then the solid waste working
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
group was reviewing the plan and trying
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
to develop its goals and so
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
I mean all of these things took place a
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
little bit later so it could that could
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
be why
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't included but I think that
 
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't included but I think that
um

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think that the I think that the
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
department I don't want to speak for the
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
department but I think that they pretty
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
much um
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
they did the efficiency budget I'm not
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
sure how much more they would have added
 
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:21.260 align:start position:0%
on I just like to
 
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
yes so this is new policy right right
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
they're not currently required to uh
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
divert food Etc so the extra person is
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure they do right right so you
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
can't put it in the budget until you
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
know it until this policy is law right
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
right yeah so but but I think just it's
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
expand from that
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to suggest that this bill be
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
retained and be part of a broader
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
conversation about the solid waste
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
Bureau and a broader conversation about
 
00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
we have a we now have a solid waste
 
00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:09.380 align:start position:0%
management plan we haven't had one since
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
2003 we haven't really had clear-cut
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
goals to pursue
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
we haven't been surrounded by states
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
that are very aggressively trying to do
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
better with their solid waste and you
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
know the discussion about landfills is
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
obviously roiling our state and we have
 
00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:34.339 align:start position:0%
to on I mean I just think we have to
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
rebuild the solid waste Bureau from
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
where it was we've got to start we've
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
got a plan and we can just really dig in
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
now and and and do better with these
 
00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
now and and and do better with these
issues

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.250 align:start position:0%
issues
um

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
I've really become a Believer I have to
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
say I've never been engaged with the
 
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:57.740 align:start position:0%
subject quite so much which I understood
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
involved every single individual every
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
single business I mean it just we all
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
consume things and we all throw things
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
away and I think it's time that we think
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit better about how we're
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
managing it
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
um so I I really
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
I look forward to talking with the
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
division a little bit more on this and
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I hope we can make this a reality
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
I hope that um
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
we help Des do better for our for our
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
talents and our businesses and our
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative kimbrells thank you Mr
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
chair it's the bill implies that if
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are no uh facilities that can
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
handle the waste within 20 miles then
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's then the generator generator is
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
exempt that's right okay and um
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
um how many of these type of facilities
 
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:04.460 align:start position:0%
do we have around the state
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
would there be one located within 20
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
miles of a lot of places presumably or
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be there wouldn't be and
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know this obviously I mean I think
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
you run into this a lot when you try to
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
do an initiative like this it's a little
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
bit of a chicken and egg situation but I
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
can tell and I don't know who you want
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
to call the chicken and who you want to
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
call the egg but I can tell you there
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
are some business chickens that are
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
really interested in sharing some of
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
these eggs
 
00:57:37.089 --> 00:57:37.099 align:start position:0%
and follow up Mr chair
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
uh and in in terms of the other states
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
that have already done this and have
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
some experience who's who's enforcing it
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
or how are they enforcing it and are
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
there any penalties handed out to these
 
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
certificates of compliance and they I
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
mean they just do a procedure I think
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty light touch I don't think
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
anybody is going in there smashing eggs
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
on anybody's heads but to continue the
 
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.670 align:start position:0%
on anybody's heads but to continue the
metaphor

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
metaphor
 
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
metaphor
um but

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh on our let me put it this way on our
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste working group we have a
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative of uh private landfill
 
00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:29.420 align:start position:0%
public landfill
 
00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.450 align:start position:0%
public landfill
hospitals

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:31.460 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
retailers small towns Big Towns the Bea
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
everybody that I could I mean that would
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
make sense and
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
in identifying a really good way of
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
starting to achieve our goals and saving
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
our landfill space this was the one that
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
so going back to my fiscal question okay
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the original
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
language under 149 M27 is refuse
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
reduction and you're adding the
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition of food waste
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
is there somewhere now that's embedded
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the department that's doing the
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna leave that to Des but in
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
their reorganization I just
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
in their reorganization let's just they
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
did not have a planning department and
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
because of all these initiatives that
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been pushing forward as a
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
legislature and I will say
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
virtually unanimously
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
the reorg has taken
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
one person that I think was in
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
permitting and they have now a planning
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
department and they have one up so they
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
have two people and I believe they call
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
it the planning and waste reduction
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
section and they can tell you more about
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
that but yes I mean that's their
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to be
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil will ask the Des to
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
quickly come forward and
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
explain your position whatever it might
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
be and if you could state your name for
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Nork I am
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
representing the solid waste management
 
01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:40.339 align:start position:0%
Bureau at New Hampshire Des
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe that representative evil
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
provided you a copy of our letter of
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
testimony for the bill when it was in
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
hearing before Ena we are not taking a
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
position on the bill per se although we
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
do think that the concept has Merit one
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that we had identified
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
in the original hearing was that
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
additional Personnel requirement to
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
fully carry out and robustly enforce the
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh the new policy that this would
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
implement but that being said this is a
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
policy that is in place in other states
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
it is actually very closely modeled
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
after the state of Vermont and how they
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
started out their food waste disposal
 
01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:22.250 align:start position:0%
started out their food waste disposal
ban

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
ban
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so there are models where we we see
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
this working
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and we think that you know if Des
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
were to
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
fully uh carry out this responsibility
 
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
we would want to do it in a workman-like
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
way uh which is why we would we would
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
need that additional position
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
um I can I took some notes on some of
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked I don't
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
know if you would if that would be
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
helpful for me to try to address some of
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
the the questions uh that the committee
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
raised already
 
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.069 align:start position:0%
raised already
okay

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
uh so uh
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
the most recent question about the the
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
section in the statute that references
 
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:00.500 align:start position:0%
refuse reduction I believe the bill
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
amends that to say disposal prohibited
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
if you actually look at that section of
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
the statue it's titled refuse reduction
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
which is kind of an erroneous title um
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I think the bill is trying to correct
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
that because the other sections or the
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
other provisions of that
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh of m20149 M27 talk about not
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
disposing leaf and yard waste in the in
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
landfills not disposing of a wet cell
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
like automotive batteries
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's just trying to to clear that
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
up and make it a little bit clearer in
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
the statute that in fact that section is
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
more about prohibiting disposal in a
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
landfill or an incinerator
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative people did
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
a good job of answering a question of
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
who is currently carrying out uh issues
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
related to uh you know disposal and and
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of waste that we
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
dispose of that is in fact myself along
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
with Paige Wilson who is sitting behind
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
me so we are the the cohort within the
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
solid waste management Bureau that we
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
call ourselves the materials management
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
education and planning section so we are
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
the kind of the the section that was
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
resurrected after many years of of lack
 
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
of attention at DES to Solid Waste
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
Management planning and uh waste
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
reduction recycling you know more more
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the we have a hierarchy in the state
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
waste disposal hierarchy and that's what
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
our section is trying to help uphold you
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
know things that are more preferable
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell's you asked
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
about uh how many facilities currently
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
exist that would be able to uh fulfill
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
the need that this ban would would put
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
in place uh currently there are I think
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
I don't have the exact numbers but I
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
think right around 10 or 12 permitted
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
composting facilities in the state but
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
the the way the bill is structured there
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
are other
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
facilities that could also help like
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative was was mentioning Food
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
donation uh you know so there's kind of
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
a panoply of different facilities that
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
could help fulfill this ban
 
01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:13.549 align:start position:0%
could help fulfill this ban
um

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is and this is how
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
other states have implemented it they
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
delay the actual effective date so that
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
it gives it sends a signal to the
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
um to the industry that that wants to
 
01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
start composting facilities or anaerobic
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
digestion facilities or Food donation
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
networks by putting a law in place and
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
having a delayed implementation it sends
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
that signal and allows them time to
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
develop that infrastructure that would
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
be necessary so that I think that was
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
kind of contemplated in how this bill
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
was structured as well gives a two-year
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
kind of DeLay So that folks are aware
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
that this is coming and that they can
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
adapt and have time to do that
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire asked about uh
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
tonnage uh on a weekly basis we don't
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
have the exact numbers broken down by
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
week but representative evil was correct
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
that if you just look at what's disposed
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
of in New Hampshire and in our landfills
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
and incinerators it is about 2 million
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
tons uh annually about half of that
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
comes from New Hampshire the other half
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
comes from out of state so if you take 1
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
million which is half of 2 million and
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
break that down uh over the course of
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
the year it's roughly 20 000 tons just
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
doing back of them and back of the
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
napkin kind of calculation
 
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.190 align:start position:0%
napkin kind of calculation
um

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
Des did some rough calculations to try
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
to figure out how much food waste is
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
generated in the state we think we're
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
just using some some estimates from the
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
EPA but we think that according to the
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
if the EPA estimate holds true for New
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's probably around 180 or
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
190 000 tons per year so this is a
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the waste stream
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
um you know if
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
if we generate collectively around 1
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
million tons
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
um you know 200 000 tons is is a is a
 
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:09.059 align:start position:0%
pretty good chunk of that about 20 or so
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so those are some of the the
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
questions that I had um oh there was a
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
question about how do you estimate I
 
01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:17.579 align:start position:0%
think it was representative Griffin
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
um how do you estimate
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
who would be subject to the ban
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
um what other states have done is
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
they've actually developed
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
um through research with an organization
 
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:29.180 align:start position:0%
called the the center for Eco technology
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
they've created a sector by sector
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
different estimators for how much food
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
waste a particular kind of business
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
entity might generate so a lot of states
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
have actually leaned on this it's it's a
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's a basically a compendium of
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
different uh businesses like restaurants
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
hotels grocery stores based on square
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
footage based on number of employees to
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
help kind of narrow down who might be
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
subject to the ban and that's what a lot
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
of other states have have leaned on that
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
kind of research
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
is that available to us do you have a
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
copy that I can make that available yeah
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
I'll do a little research when I get
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
back to the office there is a website I
 
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
if the testimony that I distributed
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday there's a link link to the
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
estimator site right so if you get the
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
digital version you can click on it and
 
01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
it'll get you to the estimator
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
right representative McGuire thank you
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I wanted to ask about this
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
out of state issue at the bottom of the
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
letter from Des it lists a bunch of
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
states that have this representative
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
Ebel implied that the state of Maine has
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
this but but the main is not on this
 
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.130 align:start position:0%
this but but the main is not on this
list

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
so so there Hannaford in Maine is doing
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
this on their own not because they're
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
required I see that's all right let me
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
asking so
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
um if a grocery store in Massachusetts
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
was sending its ways to New Hampshire I
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
assume this ban would start to apply to
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's not clear to me
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I think the way the bill and I think
 
01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:20.420 align:start position:0%
I see representative
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
comes off
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
I mean yes that's that's kind of the
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
point you know because we want to have
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
an across-the-board ban that applies not
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
just to us but to the the out of state
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
depositors of trash in our landfills
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay so as a follow-up when you're
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
enforcing it the 20 miles you would have
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
to know this Grocery Store in
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what's going on within 20
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
miles of them
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
not just what's going on in New
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right in order to to enforce
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
this correctly I guess is that it's a
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I think our
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction would really be within the
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I think it would
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of a
 
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
a stretch for us to start regulating
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
entities outside of the state borders
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
but what we can regulate are the
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
so so if it is waste that's going to a
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
landfill that is banned from disposal at
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
that landfill that's that's where we can
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
regulate so we have jurisdiction over
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
the facilities that we permit in the
 
01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:31.669 align:start position:0%
the facilities that we permit in the
state

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
um you know if it's a disposal facility
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
or whatever we do have jurisdiction over
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
that but the generator itself I think
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
it's a little questionable I'm not a
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I'm not sure if how how to to
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
Really interpret the language of the
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
statuteness or if this were to be
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
adopted in statute but it just in
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
general I think our jurisdiction is
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly within the state of New
 
01:09:50.699 --> 01:09:51.470 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly within the state of New
Hampshire

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
all right I'll save the rest for
 
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.510 align:start position:0%
all right I'll save the rest for
discussions

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
so I hopefully have a quick question for
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
you on your support from the Department
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
you said primarily your support was
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
because of the cost factor I guess
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
it would appear if it's a worthwhile
 
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.830 align:start position:0%
it would appear if it's a worthwhile
program

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.550 align:start position:0%
program
um

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
and if the money was there you would
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I I can't speak for the Department
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily I think
 
01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.209 align:start position:0%
necessarily I think
um

01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
as a as a general rule I think we are
 
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
just not taking a position on this bill
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
as a you know as a policy but we did
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
want to voice Our concern about the cost
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary just to be you
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
know sure that we were considering that
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
if it was to be implemented and I guess
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
just to clearly answer your question I
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
can't say whether we would support like
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
clearly support the bill if that was to
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
come to fruition
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.970 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
you

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
so uh well obviously we'll hold on to
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
so moving right along I see a
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant here I would
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
assume you're here to speak on House
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
if you could come forward and take the
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
welcome to division one
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.189 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
representative

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
and representing Sullivan district 6
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
which is Claremont and Croydon I come
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
in regards to House Bill 337 which was
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
heard by the policy committee and passed
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
there was a mistake made in the drafting
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
of a bill which created a fiscal note
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
which you see before you
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
and subsequently we modified that bill
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
to reduce the need for the physical note
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't see
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
director Courtney here but my
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is in the testimony
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
during the time it was being heard along
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
that that basically either reduced or
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
almost eliminated the need for the
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.310 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
so

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't have an email from her per se I
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
think you folks they want to go back and
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
revisit that fiscal note and ask her to
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
have it be trapped it or redone
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
but the intent of the bill before we get
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
into the finance is the policy side of
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
it what we heard during the summer I was
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
sitting on a committee
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
to look at oplc
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that was heard
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
notices of meetings the ability to have
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
documents like you folks have before you
 
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.370 align:start position:0%
documents like you folks have before you
today

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
for those documents to be shared with
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
the public prior to the meeting itself
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
so the bill fundamentally
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
enhances the right to know our
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
government is based upon transparency
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's a foundation of democracy
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
and when you have boards which have
 
01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
and they don't notice the meetings
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
sufficiently enough a lot of people who
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
are professionals
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability in their work
 
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.630 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability in their work
schedule

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
within 24 to 48 hours to take a day off
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
they have to schedule the time so in
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
order to accomplish that or to
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
what we ask for is the notice be posted
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks before the meeting
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
we also want to be sure that the
 
01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.689 align:start position:0%
we also want to be sure that the
documents

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
that are being shared by the board
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
are available to the public
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
so when the board is discussing the
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
documents the people in the audience
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that they regulate or the
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
public itself understand what the
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
conversation is all about so that was
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
I did work with director Courtney we
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
modified the
 
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:50.060 align:start position:0%
reason for the fiscal note
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
we also went back and she drafted
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
something to be sure it wasn't in
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
violation of 91a because her concern
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
which I totally support
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
there'd be
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
possible times in which the documents
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
need to be protected for whatever reason
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
so it could be going through an
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
application for a licensure
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
so as long as the documents do not
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
violate 91a
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
they should be made available publicly
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill and I'll
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
send you my testimony I didn't want to
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
read it to you verbatim I think you can
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
probably read it as well as I can but
 
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'll send it to you folks
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
as soon as I'm done with the meeting I
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
should have brought copies with you I
 
01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.570 align:start position:0%
should have brought copies with you I
apologize

01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
oh no apology necessary we you probably
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
saved us some work and we try to stick
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal impact of legislation so
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
you're telling us you don't see any
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
physical impact now but again we just
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
work with what we've received and it
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
shows a physical impact of over three
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars correct a year
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I guess we'll have to wait for a new
 
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:50.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note Mr Hoffman have we heard
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
all right so nothing nothing new out
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
there yet then we don't have anything
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
new okay thanks Mr chairman who who is
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
the one that triggers the review of the
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because I talked to director
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
Courtney this morning when the amendment
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
went through there was no request for
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note to be revised she would
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
reach out to the legislative budget
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
Assistance office and they would get
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note or lack thereof to us
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh procedural question if the fiscal
 
01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:27.500 align:start position:0%
note comes back
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
basically zero you can build is
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
basically basically that point in time
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
be vacated or do you still have to vote
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
on it well we would still vote on it but
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
we would know to the full committee
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal loan so we'd probably
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
say in the committee report we found no
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact okay
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
all right that's my testimony for this
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
morning are there any questions of
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
of Representative Merchant you don't
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
have one oh I know no
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
this is more of a statement but I heard
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
the same thing from Carol that
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said that that
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
it was an error and and therefore they
 
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
changed it so that to get rid of the
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
money out of the bill so
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for your attendance
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
good morning if you could share your
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
name for us my name is Douglas osterhau
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
I am general counsel for the office of
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh we did not receive a fiscal note
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
worksheet request for this third Bill
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to put one together if if
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
the committee did So like
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm really just here to observe and
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anyone might have I
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
did draft the fiscal note worksheet on
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
two iterations of the bill
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
kept hopping around
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
if you could again get together with
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
Melissa or Mike Hoffman and get that
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%

01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we my dad is fighting all my cancer
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be a remission but his
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh red blood cells are off and we went
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
down we brought like 100 200 plus worth
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
of four because he missed layout enroll
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open the work session on
 
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:07.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
347 establishing a superior land use
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
review docket and I have to say I'm very
 
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
disappointed that this representative
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
does not still serve on finance but we
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
are you are a Miss sir well thank you
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I have to say I miss you guys too I
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
really had it was uh there was a a tough
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
choice because I really enjoyed working
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
on finance although I was on on division
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
two but nonetheless I enjoyed working on
 
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.870 align:start position:0%
two but nonetheless I enjoyed working on
finance

01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
so anyway I'm here to uh testify in
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
support of uh House Bill 347 which
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
passed the policy uh committee as you
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
know it authorizes the Superior Court uh
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
01:33:49.739 --> 01:33:50.330 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
um

01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
after the governor makes the initial
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
nomination to establish a land-use
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
docket which would be responsible for uh
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
hearing uh which would appoint a judge
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's experienced in that area of the
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
law and would be responsible for hearing
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
all land use appeals throughout the
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
state it's sort of modeled as I as I
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think on the when I spoke on
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
the floor after the business court
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
docket example which has been in effect
 
01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
docket example which has been in effect
for

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
probably close to 15 years now and
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
really has been very successful that
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
that docket again sort of consolidates
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
complex business cases uh before one
 
01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
complex business cases uh before one
judge

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
um uh in Merrimack in Merrimack County
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
um although the judge can can travel to
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
other places if need be and that has
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
worked out very successfully I think if
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
you talk to the members of the bar or
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
the business Community they'd say that
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
that they think that's that's been a
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
success so
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you know this will this as everybody
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
knows I think we have a housing problem
 
01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:57.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't going to be the Panacea
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
to solve the the uh the housing problem
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I think it will uh be a step in the
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
right direction and I think a pretty
 
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
significant step because one of the
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
things that that we've heard repeatedly
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
is that the time it takes for cases to
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to sort of the regular
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
docket to go uh the land use cases to be
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
resolved in the Superior Court can be
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
can take a long time and that is a real
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
discouragement for people uh who are you
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
know for developers and that kind of
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
thing so I think this will will uh
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
will help to alleviate that issue and
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully help to make more affordable
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
housing available throughout the state
 
01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:46.310 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
well since I'm on the bill is one of the
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
sponsors I'll let representative McGuire
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
share the discussion
 
01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
well my ears perked up when you said the
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
words Merrimack County because three of
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
us on this committee are members of
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
America from Merrimack County so
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I guess we provide security for the
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
courts is this bill going to end up
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
costing our County something for for
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
more of that you know I don't think so
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
just because it's going to be um I mean
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
they'll you know there will be another
 
01:36:17.219 --> 01:36:18.530 align:start position:0%
they'll you know there will be another
judge

01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:21.380 align:start position:0%
well I mean if
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
arguably it could you know you could
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
have a sheriff's expense for another
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
another uh court officer to provide
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
security and you know I have to say I
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
said Merrimack County because that's
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
where the business Court typically sits
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
and it is a state capital it kind of
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense I suspect um and I know uh
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
Karen Gorham is here from the judicial
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
branch I suspect that what she would say
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
is although Merrimack County might be
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
the sort of default if it turns out that
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's you know they have more
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
courtroom available in some other County
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
assuming it's sort of generally in the
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know in the area where most of the
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
cases are arose there would not be no
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
reason they couldn't uh house the court
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
there but I I would tend to think
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
oh because because you're a sponsor I
 
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
see you're sitting over there yes all
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
right thank you so
 
01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.149 align:start position:0%
right thank you so
um

01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
is this sized correctly I I guess I
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
assume that if there weren't the very
 
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
many land use cases or maybe this this
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
judge the backlog of land use cases went
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
away or something they would do other
 
01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
Superior Court cases that's that's
 
01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:36.860 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
again as with the business Court you
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
know judge McNamara judge McNamara was
 
01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
the first business court judge and
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
served until he retired and I believe
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
judge Anderson is now taken over but my
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
understanding is that although judge
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
McNamara did mostly business cases there
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
were times when for one reason or
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
another you know the schedule was such
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
that he could do other things and I know
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
for example he tried some criminal cases
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
I suspect he may have tried some other
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
cases and I think that would be true in
 
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
the land you stock it also and it may
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
also be true that if you know at any
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
particular time there were like a whole
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
and even more uh uh heavy load of land
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
use cases that uh chief justice Neto
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
would assign another judge to work with
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
you know with the land use judge to hear
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
one last one for me and then I'll ask
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
for others are land use cases somehow
 
01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
seasonal I mean construction generally
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen as much during the winter
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
I would say I would say in terms of like
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
when they're filed maybe although I I
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
can't say that for sure I think in terms
 
01:38:56.209 --> 01:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
of you know when they end up when
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
hearings end up being held and the cases
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh adjudicated I would tend to say no
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's that generally is not the case
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
any other Representatives have questions
 
01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:07.790 align:start position:0%
any other Representatives have questions
for

01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
nope seeing none thank you great well
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
give us some information about
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Mr acting chair
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Gorham I'm the superior
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
court administrator and I can assure you
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire it will not cost
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County any more money we have
 
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
managed to fully max out the Merrimack
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
County Superior Court there are three
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
courtrooms there and three full-time
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
judges so um if this bill comes to
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
fruition we would likely house the land
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
use docket at Hillsboro North Superior
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
Court in Manchester they have an extra
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
courtroom that is currently used just
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
for arraignments and we can hold those
 
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
for arraignments and we can hold those
elsewhere

01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
we still have the Old Courthouse that
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
may not be fully yes all right thank you
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
I was part of that move that was an
 
01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:07.340 align:start position:0%
interesting day
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
my reason for being here is I wanted to
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing that um that with
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
regard to the number of Judges that
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
we're asking for for the Superior Court
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
as you are probably all well aware we
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
had a weighted caseload study completed
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch over the last two
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
years that weighted caseload study
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that we needed 2.5 more
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges in our budget we
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
asked for one more Superior Court judge
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
if the land use docket passes and comes
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
into fruition we are not asking for a
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
second new judge it would be only the
 
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
land use Court Judge what that would
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
allow us to do is prioritize the land
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
use docket cases but as you correctly
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out representative McGuire the
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
statute also the land use docket statute
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
allows that judge to be assigned to any
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
other matters within the jurisdiction of
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
the superior court so by pulling the um
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
the complex civil case type of land use
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
docket cases from our judges around the
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
state adding a judge who will specialize
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
in this type of case we're pulling some
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the work from our local judges and we
 
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
would not need another one to fill that
 
01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.530 align:start position:0%
would not need another one to fill that
position

01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and that is really what I wanted to
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
clarify for you today that we're not
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
asking for a second new judge one new
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
all right representative Sweeney has a
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you so
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
much for being here
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
will the filing fee to get in front of
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
this court be uniform across the border
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
will depend on development size
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
no the filing fee for all Superior Court
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
civil cases to file electronically which
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
all of our cases are is 280 that applies
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
to every type of case oftentimes in some
 
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
case types will get a motion to request
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
a waiver of a filing fee sometimes with
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
a restraining order usually not with
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
businesses and private attorneys but we
 
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
will get waivers to waive that fee but
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
other than that it's a flat fee 280
 
01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
other than that it's a flat fee 280
dollars

01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
let me ask you about a related question
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with here and that's
 
01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:15.139 align:start position:0%
the board of tax and land appeals
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
so when someone has a has a dispute over
 
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
their property tax
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
assessment they have a choice of going
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court or the board of tax on
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
land appeals do you see do you know
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
how many go to Superior Court is it next
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
to none or is it it's a lot it's a lot
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay so a lot of our
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um our our assessment appeals right now
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
deal with telecommunications companies
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we have cases going back
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
four four calendar years for for tax
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
years on these cases we get hundreds of
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
those every year we
 
01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
um we consolidate all of those cases at
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Superior Court in front of one
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
judge the legal issue is the same in all
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
of those cases so I think what happened
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the past maybe if judgment is still
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
here no he might remember one of the
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
issues went on appeal to the Supreme
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
Court it applied to all 400 pending
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
cases and resolved a number of those
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
cases then another issue came up the
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
idea is to take one lead case get that
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
in front of the Supreme Court decide and
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
then hopefully resolve the other cases
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
so they're managed well most of our
 
01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:32.219 align:start position:0%
cases are are the Telecommunications we
 
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:34.100 align:start position:0%
do not get a lot of
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
individual homeowners appealing the
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of their home we get a lot of
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
the the Telecommunications is this the
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
business judge that does that or is it
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
is not oh it is not so it's yet another
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's just a Consolidated case type
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
simply like we do with all of the YDC
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
claims that are coming in we've got
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand YDC cases right now
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
and so Superior Court we've Consolidated
 
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
those in front of one judge and have a
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
lead case that people file into there's
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
a few offshoot cases for those that were
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
sent to group homes that were not
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
managed by the state but most of those
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
cases are in front of one judge in
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Superior Court he was in
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
Merrimack where they all came in but he
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
thankfully took them with him when he
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
was assigned to Rockingham
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
I see thank you representative Sweeney
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
hey you just to follow up on that
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
the conversation we're now having what's
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
the backlog of land use cases compared
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the backlog of tax appeal cases I do
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
not have that number
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I I do not have that number I do know
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's considered a complex
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
civil case type there are a lot of
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
pleadings in land use cases there are a
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of hearings to be held and sometimes
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
they can get backlogged behind the
 
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
criminal cases which have statutory
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
deadlines this bill the way I read it
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
gives gives statutory deadlines to these
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
cases and having the one dedicated judge
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
will allow them to move through without
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
getting behind our average caseload per
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
judge for calendar year 2022 was 900
 
01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.629 align:start position:0%
judge for calendar year 2022 was 900
cases

01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them are criminal that
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to have their quick hearings and
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
Speedy trials well you appreciate it
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
judicial branch will be healed you know

02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
our continuing conversation uh of solid
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
waste so
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
um what this bill would do it does a
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things the first thing was
 
02:01:40.129 --> 02:01:40.139 align:start position:0%
that that I should explain is that last
 
02:01:40.139 --> 02:01:41.570 align:start position:0%
that that I should explain is that last
year

02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
um the the legislature and the governor
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
signed in to affect the creation of a
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund and the
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund would be a
 
02:01:54.609 --> 02:01:54.619 align:start position:0%
program whereby
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities and businesses could
 
02:02:00.609 --> 02:02:00.619 align:start position:0%
participate in a matching grant program
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
that would continue in our quest to
 
02:02:09.609 --> 02:02:09.619 align:start position:0%
reduce or better handle
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste in the state of New
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what this bill would do first
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
of all there there was a there was a
 
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
change that we wanted to expand the
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
sources of fund funds for the for the
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
fund because when it originally came
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
through last year the only source that
 
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
was identified was an EPA Grant and I
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys know it um
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
there was a as part of the
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law there are EPA grants
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that are available for recycling and
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste management
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
and everybody was super excited to be
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
able to use those funds but the
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines have come out and pursuant to
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
the guidelines States can't apply for
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure funds only towns and
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
businesses can and the base rate is 250
 
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
000 for a grant so it's you know
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
um it also I think just in the haste of
 
02:03:09.599 --> 02:03:11.089 align:start position:0%
um it also I think just in the haste of
legislating

02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we should have had a more expanded uh
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
source of funds and so that's that was
 
02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the main thing that the bill did and it
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
did um it did get amended because there
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
were a couple of grammatical errors so
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't I mean it wasn't a
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
really big deal any play anyway so the
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill came through the environment and
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee with a 20-zip uh
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
unanimous recommendation for passage it
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote in the state I
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
mean in the in the house and so what I'm
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
here before you now to talk with you
 
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
about is the opportunity for the state
 
02:03:54.890 --> 02:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money into the solid
 
02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
waste management fund one other thing
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
that we did do as part of this bill is
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
it it connects up with um the goals that
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
are set forth in the in the management
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
plan and goals that have been identified
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
by the working group that we really want
 
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
to put forth the concept of concept uh
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
composting and food waste diversion as a
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
way of decrease seeing what's going into
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
our landfills and so actually at Senator
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
Howard Pearl's suggestion we tweaked the
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
language slightly to do a prioritization
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
for composting for the first couple of
 
02:04:39.729 --> 02:04:39.739 align:start position:0%
years of the Appropriations existence
 
02:04:45.129 --> 02:04:45.139 align:start position:0%
the fund is an again another mechanism
 
02:04:49.450 --> 02:04:49.460 align:start position:0%
that a lot of other states use to try to
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
promote their Solid Waste diversion
 
02:04:56.410 --> 02:04:56.420 align:start position:0%
within their within their states
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
and as I explained when we were talking
 
02:04:59.219 --> 02:05:00.609 align:start position:0%
and as I explained when we were talking
before

02:05:00.609 --> 02:05:00.619 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities are kind of out there on
 
02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
their own trying to figure things out
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
and they need some support for doing
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
their own planning and their own
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
planning is really like a pivotal part
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
of the whole state as a whole doing
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
better and putting in in making the
 
02:05:24.729 --> 02:05:24.739 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan goals
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
work and really
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a partnership I think
 
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
amongst all you know between the
 
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor and and our
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
agencies to really just try to rebuild
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
and do better with solid waste and our
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities are a really key part of
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
that and giving them some help through
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
this fund through a matching grant
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
program would be another really great
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
way to start and we do have a a des
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
letter I know they really like this idea
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
they tend to be not you know they tend
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
to make not take positions so much on
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
outside Appropriations but I think to
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
promote the partnership for all of us it
 
02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing I again I just
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that I'm I really hope
 
02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we can get a broader conversation
 
02:06:23.890 --> 02:06:23.900 align:start position:0%
going within the legislature focusing on
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
Source reduction
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and including pfas including all
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that are going into our
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
landfills we have to deal with the
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
landfill leachate it has a lot of toxics
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
in it that end up in our wastewater
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
treatment plants we have to test for the
 
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
toxics we have to suck them back out and
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
they have to go back in the landfill and
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
I really think that if we can help our
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
towns and businesses do better from the
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
front end we'll all benefit in the long
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
run and it will promote uh business I
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
know a lot of businesses have been
 
02:07:04.609 --> 02:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
interested in this
 
02:07:04.619 --> 02:07:07.490 align:start position:0%
interested in this
so

02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
Mr McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about line seven
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
so if I read this correctly this is
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
removing the fiscal committee from the
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
process of accepting such grants is that
 
02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:29.870 align:start position:0%
process of accepting such grants is that
correct

02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
I think it was the executive Council
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
the executive or was it or was it the
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
fit I left my bill over there sorry a
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
little discombobulated here all right
 
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman Melissa and he yes or maybe
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
both right it would allow the
 
02:07:51.050 --> 02:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
the department to accept funds directly
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
in without going through government
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
Council and fiscal committee as long as
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're used for that specific purpose
 
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
I see so
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
um yes so let me push back on this
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal committee and the
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
executive Council exist for very
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
important reasons which is when people
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
give us money there very often our
 
02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
strings attached and and we can't allow
 
02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
an agency to to make a decision that
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
obligates the state in some way
 
02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
without the legislators and the approval
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
right and and and the executive Council
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
I guess in some cases so so I I would
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
object to to this particular section
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay well I think the idea there was to
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process but I
 
02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
certainly understand where you're coming
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
from and if that stood in the way of
 
02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
moving the fund forward you'd get no
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
objection from me and may I continue
 
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's talk about the the funds
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
do you know if the governor has has
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
asked for any funds like this uh section
 
02:09:08.089 --> 02:09:08.099 align:start position:0%
two I do not believe that he he has
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
again the
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
um you know the bill has been brought
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
forward very very late in the in the
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
process and the law as it existed
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
um it only was the fund was able to
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
accept funds from the EPA so this
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment was necessary to expand that I
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
will tell you that I've approached the
 
02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
governor's office and I've opened up the
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak for them it
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
didn't sound to me like they would have
 
02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
an objection I think they're they're
 
02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
an objection I think they're they're
very

02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
um interested in the subject of solid
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
waste as a general matter I mean we
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
certainly have been talking about this
 
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
issue of landfills and and I I just like
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
to talk about that a little bit there's
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
a general
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
sense that New Hampshire actually for
 
02:10:07.609 --> 02:10:07.619 align:start position:0%
its own trash we have we have adequate
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
capacity and as we now know about half
 
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
of the trash that goes into private
 
02:10:16.209 --> 02:10:16.219 align:start position:0%
landfills comes from out of state
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
we can't really block that but what we
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
can do is do better in protecting our
 
02:10:25.370 --> 02:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
own capacity and one of the ways to
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
protect our capacity is simply to put
 
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
less trash in our landfills
 
02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:32.689 align:start position:0%
less trash in our landfills
um

02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
I think that should be a societal goal
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
if I can say that I mean if you're a
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
Yankee you don't really want to be
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
throwing everything
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
um away and you know as I said
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the back side of it the the
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
landfills that exist are pretty much
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
with us forever and yes they have Clay
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
lining yes they are monitored you know
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
over a period of time they can leak
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and this leachate that comes out of
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
them is pretty much of a toxic stew that
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
we've got to deal with and if I mean I
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
was thinking about this last night if
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're half of the trash that's coming
 
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
into our state is from out of state
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the leachate that is
 
02:11:20.159 --> 02:11:21.470 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the leachate that is
coming

02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
right so anyway we need to divert as
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say that I share
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
representative why is concerns
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should be bypassing
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
either the governor's Council or the
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
so just far okay
 
02:12:01.609 --> 02:12:01.619 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that fiscal
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
committee review where did that come
 
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
from was that the sponsors or did the
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
Des suggest that removing the governor's
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
I worked with the LBA and we discussed
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
about we discussed it and we thought
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
that to simplify the process that might
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
be a way to go but I'm not gonna I mean
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's my bill Des I won't I
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
won't say that they put that in there
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
this was something in my um
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
desire to streamline the process that
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
that uh I thought about and that that I
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
that I did so I take full responsibility
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
for it I wasn't trying to dodge anything
 
02:12:50.209 --> 02:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
I was just thinking that you know in the
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the overall scheme of things it would
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
be helpful to try to get our money to
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
our towns and businesses that's really
 
02:12:56.699 --> 02:12:58.850 align:start position:0%
our towns and businesses that's really
it

02:12:58.850 --> 02:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I suggested that
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
when uh I worked with representative
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
Abel on this bill because the money for
 
02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
that fund is for very specific purpose
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
unlike many things where you can get a
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
grant and use them for various things
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a decision on how to use the
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
money but I also understand the concerns
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm sure chairman
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
Weiler is chair of the fiscal committee
 
02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
would probably would like to see less
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
work but we also in
 
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
we also enjoy being thorough but thanks
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
02:13:49.970 --> 02:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
to members of the committee for the
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
record I am Maureen Mooney I represent
 
02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
the town of Merrimack and Hillsborough
 
02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
District 12. unfortunately my community
 
02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
has seen firsthand and has been deeply
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
affected by pfas evidence shows it's
 
02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
spreading everywhere even to our waste
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
water into our landfills
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
every dollar counts every dollar counts
 
02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
and counteracting pfas and where it may
 
02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
spread next so I would just recommend
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
that this division recommend to the full
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
finance committee that we broaden the
 
02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
funding sources for Des to explore this
 
02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.649 --> 02:14:38.659 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
representative from Merrimack right is
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
that Hillsborough 12 or Hillsborough 12
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
now trying to learn them all I still
 
02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out McGuire's District
 
02:14:49.689 --> 02:14:49.699 align:start position:0%
but representative McGuire
 
02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
he is Merrimack I believe right what
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
county mayor yeah all right let me ask a
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
question no I don't want to ask a
 
02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:00.250 align:start position:0%
question no I don't want to ask a
question

02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:00.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
say that the municipalities are under
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
extreme extreme stress trying to deal
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
with the Avalanche of waste coming their
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
way much of which includes toxic
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
chemicals including pfas
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes I would I've referred to this issue
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
as a prism there are just so many sides
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
so many areas between air groundwater
 
02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and the like I mean it's
 
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
coming up on these municipalities
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
without any warning or any preparation
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
it's just there so any help at all is a
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
certainly welcomed and would lessen that
 
02:15:45.239 --> 02:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
certainly welcomed and would lessen that
strain

02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler thank you Mr
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
chairman do you think there's one
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
particular source that you could
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have in our town
 
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
a company called cincobain
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
in 2016 as a Plastics Company with its
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
base in Paris France
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
it was discovered that P they were
 
02:16:20.930 --> 02:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
emitting pfas
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
and from that point forward it has been
 
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
and from that point forward it has been
explosive

02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
explosive
 
02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
so though I am not a scientist or an
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
investigator it is my understanding that
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
Saint gobane is clearly at the center of
 
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:41.509 align:start position:0%
Saint gobane is clearly at the center of
this

02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative Mooney I
 
02:16:44.929 --> 02:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
know that you've worked very hard on
 
02:16:46.490 --> 02:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
that issue and Merrimack and been
 
02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
leading the fight with some of your
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
other Representatives but you've really
 
02:16:51.530 --> 02:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
drawn attention to it you should be
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
thanked for that
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that thank you
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the town of Merrimack not
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
the county of Merrimack town of
 
02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
Merrimack yeah he I think representative
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
McGuire wants to set you straight now no
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
I I want to bring up something I I was
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
reading in the bill and based on your
 
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
experience on finance
 
02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
um so this bill allocates money in a
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
kind of an odd way and which is it's a
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
legislative special it takes money from
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
the current biennium not next biennium
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
right and it saves it and pays it out
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
over four years now do you think this
 
02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:31.370 align:start position:0%
over four years now do you think this
issue

02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:17:34.370 --> 02:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
ought to be simply funded in a budget so
 
02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
much per year
 
02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
maybe add infant item or just for
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
current budget or is do you like this
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
particular way that it's that it's
 
02:17:42.479 --> 02:17:43.849 align:start position:0%
particular way that it's that it's
funding

02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question certainly
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
open to different ways of funding my
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
interest is looking out for the
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
community the health and safety and
 
02:17:52.490 --> 02:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
Welfare of not only my community
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
Merrimack but the surrounding
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
communities that pfas has so quickly
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
spread to since it was discovered at
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
Saint Cobain in 2016. so I um I don't
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to say that I'm against the funding
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism or that I would be opposed to
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
other options for a funding mechanism I
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting representative
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
McGuire that we would set aside the 20
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
and 24th the 68
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
000 and 25 the 556 versus taking it all
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
out on the head end
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that seems to make more
 
02:18:37.310 --> 02:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
sense in terms of how we budget things
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
like that all right good point
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for just kind of
 
02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.139 align:start position:0%
follow off that conversation
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
are there projects that Merrimack wants
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
to do today to
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
to utilize These funds that we can't you
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
have the project for so just waiting
 
02:18:58.969 --> 02:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
till fiscal year 25 work for Merrimack
 
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
or does Merrimack can Merrimack start
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
the project next this summer if we were
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
to authorize it
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
all good questions and you know
 
02:19:12.049 --> 02:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough we lost our uh
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
excellent exceptional Wastewater Plant
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
manager she got another job she was Top
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
Notch at this and it's no wonder
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
everybody probably wanted to have her
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
work for them she would be better posed
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
or the person who took her place would
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
be bet in a better position to answer
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
that but I can tell you that there will
 
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
always be projects I can think of one
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
right now very pressing that's not
 
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily related to waste water but
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
very pressing in Merrimack and I'm sure
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
there would be others so I would say
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
bottom line of your answer is it will be
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
a welcomed arrival the funding mechanism
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
further question no good
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
all right so you know further questions
 
02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
you're always welcome here
 
02:20:00.899 --> 02:20:01.610 align:start position:0%
you're always welcome here
um

02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
I guess that's it unless the folks from
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair your name for the
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
record please my name is Michael Nork
 
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Solid Waste
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau
 
02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.310 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau
um

02:20:24.310 --> 02:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.810 --> 02:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
what what I'm going to say is that we
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
strongly support the intent of the solid
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
waste management fund and uh the idea
 
02:20:33.969 --> 02:20:33.979 align:start position:0%
that that can be used to help
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities and entities within the
 
02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
state to reduce
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
disposal of waste and landfills and
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
incinerators and and you know encourage
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
more preferable use of those those
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
materials as resources rather than as
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
wastes through recycling through
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
composting and we also strongly support
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the bill here the HP 462's intention
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
to prioritize uh use of funds to divert
 
02:21:04.490 --> 02:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
food waste because it ties into the bill
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee had considered
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
earlier on HP 300 which was to again
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
encourage disposal or diversion of food
 
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
waste so this is another way to tackle
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
the issue through giving grants to
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and to other entities
 
02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
that can engage in projects to either
 
02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
develop infrastructure for management of
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
food waste or projects to you know
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
divert food from schools or businesses
 
02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:34.849 align:start position:0%
divert food from schools or businesses
um

02:21:34.849 --> 02:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so with all that being said we have
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
we strongly support the intent here we
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
do have to be agnostic as to the the
 
02:21:44.809 --> 02:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
policy around where that funding comes
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
from and that's what this bill is is
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
really that's that's obviously the Crux
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the build 200 the 2 million dollar uh
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the fund
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
um and as representative people noted
 
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
that fund was created last year and to
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
date no funds have actually been
 
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
appropriated to that fund so so we're
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
not actually able to enact the intention
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
of that bill or that that fund
 
02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:06.590 align:start position:0%
of that bill or that that fund
um

02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
I guess with that I'm happy to take any
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have
 
02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:13.429 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have
questions

02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairman you heard what representative
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
Mooney said
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
is she a little confused about this bill
 
02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
because her issue was about waste water
 
02:22:32.290 --> 02:22:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
waste that comes out of Wastewater
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
plants turn into solid waste and then
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
get you get into landfills or are they
 
02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
or these two separate issues kind of
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
that is a great question um so there is
 
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit of confusion I think in in
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
general in terms of how Wastewater and
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
solid waste are regulated and at DES we
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
have separate programs under separate
 
02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.990 align:start position:0%
have separate programs under separate
statutes

02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
um to to regulate those separately but
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
there is definitely some overlap with
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
Wastewater when it comes to the solids
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
that are extracted from a wastewater
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
treatment plant that often do get sent
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
to landfills for disposal so so there is
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit of overlap but to my
 
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge the intent here
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
with HB 462 and the solid waste
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
management fund that was created last
 
02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
session the intent there was really to
 
02:23:24.969 --> 02:23:24.979 align:start position:0%
focus on Solid Waste Management
 
02:23:28.030 --> 02:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily the waste water
 
02:23:31.490 --> 02:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
management side of things that's just my
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
understanding but um I I could be
 
02:23:37.330 --> 02:23:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
isn't there a place like a point where
 
02:23:42.889 --> 02:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
they those two items intersect in other
 
02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
words Solid Waste has a direct impact on
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment I think I heard
 
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in The Testament P fast
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
as an example so maybe that's what's
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
being alluded to and needs to be
 
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
being alluded to and needs to be
addressed

02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representative hatch
 
02:23:58.250 --> 02:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah again the the
 
02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
as a society we use products we consume
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
products we dispose of products um so
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
there are multiple points of
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
intersection I think that that you raise
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
a good point that the products that we
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
consume and use and ultimately some of
 
02:24:17.929 --> 02:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
that can end up in in Wastewater in one
 
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
form or another or
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
chemical components of it could end up
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
in Wastewater so there is certainly some
 
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
in Wastewater so there is certainly some
overlap

02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.429 align:start position:0%
overlap
correct

02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
so I have a question of funding
 
02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
we received a number of settlements from
 
02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
air quality groundwater pollution
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
are there any funds out there because I
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
know that the department takes no
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
position with respect to the source of
 
02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
any future appropriation might there be
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
another source I don't like to put the
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
department on record of being supportive
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
of a different Source but there must is
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
there's something else out there that
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
could be used to fund this versus
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I not I'm not aware of of specific
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
sources of funding uh except to say that
 
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
there there might be future grant
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh through federal
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
agencies uh like like was discussed when
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative evil introduced Bill last
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
session there was some understanding
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
that the EPA might provide funding that
 
02:25:28.849 --> 02:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
then could be funneled into this fund we
 
02:25:30.410 --> 02:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
later found out after that that
 
02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity was kind of finalized that
 
02:25:34.610 --> 02:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
they there wasn't going to be that
 
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard to really know but I
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
think there could be potential
 
02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities through federal agencies
 
02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:44.780 align:start position:0%
or other
 
02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
state programs I think obviously General
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
funds tend to be the one that most
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
people can think of readily but uh
 
02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I guess is the short
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
answer yeah maybe if going back to Mike
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
winsett to see what is out there
 
02:26:03.410 --> 02:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder and I serve on
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal and we see hundreds of millions
 
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
of dollars often each month coming in
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for a
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
variety of of things and from a variety
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
of federal sources so I would hope that
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
maybe something was out there but that's
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
a great Point yeah there's been a lot of
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
focus from from federal programs on
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
brownfields on like arpa funding for
 
02:26:23.399 --> 02:26:25.309 align:start position:0%
brownfields on like arpa funding for
Wastewater

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
um to date there hasn't been a lot of
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
focus from the feds on on Solid Waste
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
Management that has traditionally been
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
up to the states to to fund and
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
Implement so that's that's part of the
 
02:26:36.889 --> 02:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
challenge I think for so long that there
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been really a focus on this
 
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
particular area
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh seeing no further
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions again thanks we'll close the
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
work session and see you I'm sorry
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I noticed there was
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
someone from the municipal Association
 
02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
here and I didn't know if they had any
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
thing that they wanted to add to the
 
02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:01.190 align:start position:0%
thing that they wanted to add to the
conversation

02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:27:02.929 --> 02:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
I think she's been taking notes but
 
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to speak in the
 
02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:11.270 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to speak in the
if

02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck for the record and I
 
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
represent the municipal Association and
 
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
we do support this legislation our
 
02:27:26.210 --> 02:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
members have a policy that we support
 
02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
programs that would allow municipalities
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
to reduce solid waste recycle reuse and
 
02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
of course composting and other measures
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
while maintaining any local control and
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
of course we do know that food waste
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
makes up about 20 to 25 percent of what
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
is currently going into our transfer
 
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
station so these funds would become
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
extremely important for our
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to move forward some of
 
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
their policy priorities and reducing
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions uh see you
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
at 1
 
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.100 --> 03:34:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
see information security officer for the
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
03:35:00.410 --> 03:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to this
 
03:35:02.279 --> 03:35:09.950 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to this
commissioner

03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think everybody knows you but just for
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
the record for those watching you're
 
03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Dennis
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
Goulet I'm the commissioner for the
 
03:35:23.929 --> 03:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
03:35:26.210 --> 03:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards sponsored this
 
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
bill at my request so we actually when
 
03:35:30.050 --> 03:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
when it was introduced we sat together
 
03:35:31.969 --> 03:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
to introduce it
 
03:35:33.650 --> 03:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:35:35.870 --> 03:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
the state has had a chief information
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
security officer in place for over a
 
03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:39.050 align:start position:0%
security officer in place for over a
decade

03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
decade
 
03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
so we're not asking to fund anything
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
here even though it did have a FN
 
03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
attached to what I sent
 
03:35:49.250 --> 03:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
in a zero dollar fiscal note for this
 
03:35:51.290 --> 03:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
um essentially what this is doing is
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
codifying what we're already doing in in
 
03:35:57.050 --> 03:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
statute and also making it so so I'm not
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
worried that I'm going to keep a
 
03:36:01.490 --> 03:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
security officer function running and I
 
03:36:03.769 --> 03:36:03.779 align:start position:0%
I know how important it is but you know
 
03:36:05.809 --> 03:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
for continuity I think you know the
 
03:36:07.969 --> 03:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
National Association of State Chief
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
Information officers has voted 12 years
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
running that the cyber security was the
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
number one priority so I think we want
 
03:36:16.849 --> 03:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we we have that in
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
place and and duties and
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and Authority defines
 
03:36:23.809 --> 03:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
that's simply the the objective
 
03:36:25.729 --> 03:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe you spoke to this when you
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
presented your budget if my memory
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
serves me correctly right I did
 
03:36:32.690 --> 03:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.290 --> 03:36:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.290 --> 03:36:41.300 align:start position:0%
look at anybody left
 
03:36:43.929 --> 03:36:43.939 align:start position:0%
so this person will have the same
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
unclassified level or whatever that they
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
have now that's correct they're they're
 
03:36:53.530 --> 03:36:53.540 align:start position:0%
unclassified and they we set their
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
compensation through the jcec I think
 
03:36:58.610 --> 03:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
maybe three years ago
 
03:36:58.620 --> 03:36:59.929 align:start position:0%
maybe three years ago
so

03:36:59.929 --> 03:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's all all the administrative
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
so this would appear to be something
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
that we could actually vote on and move
 
03:37:12.349 --> 03:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
along so we show a little progress I
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
move on to patch is it seconded
 
03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:01.380 --> 03:38:03.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
okay

03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
the clerk votes I and the chair
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
03:38:32.330 --> 03:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh one two three four five six seven in
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
favor and no names
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are moving things through
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
so the emotion offered by representative
 
03:38:48.170 --> 03:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
McGuire passes seven to zero
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
another blurb for you the rights of
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
committee I might as well do it now yeah
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
this is easy we got to have 20 minutes
 
03:38:54.420 --> 03:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
this is easy we got to have 20 minutes
yeah

03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:38:58.130 --> 03:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
all right well moving right along we'll
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
well as as it was originally introduced
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
however we do have some concerns with
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
um how it was amended it's amending
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
again the municipal Pace statute under
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
our current Municipal pay statute which
 
04:03:13.490 --> 04:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
is uh RSA 53f
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
um it allows lender consent
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh all lien holders if a property
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
owner wants to move forward with this
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
all lien holders have to sign off on it
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
in order for it to become a priority
 
04:03:31.010 --> 04:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
lien that is found on RSA 53 F5
 
04:03:31.020 --> 04:03:31.550 align:start position:0%
lien that is found on RSA 53 F5
um

04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:33.530 --> 04:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
however and that that part of the
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
statute hasn't been hasn't been amended
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
um however uh F uh eight has been
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
amended and it strikes the language
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
um that references the lender consent
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
and this is concerning to us because you
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
know while the intent is for C Pace it
 
04:03:56.929 --> 04:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
again is amending the municipal pay
 
04:04:00.650 --> 04:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
statute and our concern with this is the
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
impact that it could have on the
 
04:04:05.090 --> 04:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
secondary Market if you were to look up
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
at Fannie Mae and their guide guidelines
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
on selling you know or or types of
 
04:04:13.610 --> 04:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
properties their mortgages they'll buy
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
they will not buy from a bank or acquire
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
from a bank a mortgage that has a pace
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
assessment attached to it a six-month or
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me a pace assessment attached to
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
it and a lot of our banks bundle
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
mortgages sell off to the secondary
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
market and maintain the servicing rights
 
04:04:32.570 --> 04:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
so again while we don't have a um we
 
04:04:35.150 --> 04:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a a a position on the
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
underlying build them how it was amended
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
we do have a slight concern we do
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor was uh did it
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
when it was amended it keeps the
 
04:04:47.570 --> 04:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
um it keeps the assessment with the
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
property however again the concern that
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
we do have is the fact that it does
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
strike that language and create a
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
priority lien I've provided the sponsor
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh with some suggested language that
 
04:05:03.950 --> 04:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
just reinstates that consent Language by
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
adding it to the last sentence
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I provide a few folks on the on the
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
um on the sub on the committee uh with
 
04:05:14.090 --> 04:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
this language I'm happy to again I got a
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
couple more copies I'm happy to hand out
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
but again it just on page two lines 9
 
04:05:22.130 --> 04:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
through 12 just adding
 
04:05:24.769 --> 04:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
um adding on to that sentence uh to
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
state except that all prior recorded
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
mortgages or liens shall be shall retain
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
priority over the lien of assessment
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
contract unless all such mortgages lien
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
holes of record have consented to the
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
lien as provided and again it references
 
04:05:40.990 --> 04:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 53 F5
 
04:05:43.729 --> 04:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions any
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping you can answer questions
 
04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
not just on the banking part but on the
 
04:06:01.729 --> 04:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
actual what's going on here yeah so is
 
04:06:01.739 --> 04:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
actual what's going on here yeah so is
this

04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
um loans made to property owners in this
 
04:06:08.090 --> 04:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
case commercial property owners to add
 
04:06:10.250 --> 04:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
solar power and things like that to
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
their property that's my understanding
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah and and for follow-up so
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
so and the the source of funds for these
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
loans is the department is the federal
 
04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
department of U.S department of energy I
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is the U.S
 
04:06:30.530 --> 04:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
department of energy has um you know
 
04:06:31.849 --> 04:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
guidelines but it would be private
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
investors from my understanding is the
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
way it would work it would be private
 
04:06:35.220 --> 04:06:36.410 align:start position:0%
way it would work it would be private
Capital

04:06:36.410 --> 04:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
Capital
 
04:06:36.420 --> 04:06:37.670 align:start position:0%
Capital
um

04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay and so follow so so but the state
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
is guaranteeing these loans in some way
 
04:06:47.090 --> 04:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
or so it would be the municipality
 
04:06:49.969 --> 04:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
through the tax assessment would I I'm
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I'm not sure I think
 
04:06:55.130 --> 04:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for the sponsor
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if there's that mechanism
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
as a state guaranteeing those loans but
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
but there's a lien placed on the
 
04:07:04.250 --> 04:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
property yes right so that if they're
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
not paid back you could seize the
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
property and sell it that way yes yeah
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
so there would be and that's that's the
 
04:07:13.729 --> 04:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
you know the kind of the the basis of
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
our concerns is the additional lien for
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
that special assessment for that
 
04:07:17.520 --> 04:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
that special assessment for that
commercial

04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
um but you know by taking away our kind
 
04:07:23.809 --> 04:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
of um our consent rights
 
04:07:24.889 --> 04:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
um you know I think there could be
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
situations where they would be inclined
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
to I mean with Rising energy costs one
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
two it could increase the value of the
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
property if it was a if it was a risk
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
that at the time they're worth taking on
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
again so you have the C Pace but then
 
04:07:41.150 --> 04:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
you also have the pace and you know our
 
04:07:44.210 --> 04:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
our basis of our concerns is it's also
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
addressing the residential Municipal
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
Pace as well okay one last question so
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
so your main concern is which loan is
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
senior yes you want the mortgage loan to
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
be the senior loan and the this loan to
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
be junior to that yes yes correct okay
 
04:08:03.410 --> 04:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
04:08:07.130 --> 04:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Griffin
 
04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
as as I read this it's a
 
04:08:13.729 --> 04:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're mandating
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
that the local tax collector
 
04:08:19.870 --> 04:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
Services loan basically
 
04:08:22.610 --> 04:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
correct it would be it the way it works
 
04:08:24.170 --> 04:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
is it would be again that special
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
assessment would be applied to the you
 
04:08:28.849 --> 04:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
know it would be registered I believe in
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
the register of deeds it'd be uh paid
 
04:08:34.130 --> 04:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
through their the tax collection as a
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
special assessment
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
I was I understand that
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
state laws we the state would be
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for the cause that involved
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:08:50.050 --> 04:08:50.060 align:start position:0%
it would appear it would appear
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
this is probably not a question for you
 
04:08:54.530 --> 04:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
sir but maybe Mr Hoffman is there any
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
reason this didn't go to a second
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee before coming here like calm
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
Congress perhaps
 
04:09:01.020 --> 04:09:03.469 align:start position:0%
Congress perhaps
sure

04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:09:15.290 --> 04:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we're still awaiting a
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
number of folks so we haven't received
 
04:09:21.650 --> 04:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
anything from the Department of energy
 
04:09:21.660 --> 04:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
anything from the Department of energy
um

04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.279 --> 04:09:27.309 align:start position:0%
 
treasury

04:09:27.309 --> 04:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
as it's amended
 
04:09:35.330 --> 04:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I think we only would need to hear
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association and they
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
have provided something we just haven't
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
had time to put it into a fiscal number
 
04:09:44.929 --> 04:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
perhaps we got the bill a little quickly
 
04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
and missed some of the oversight
 
04:09:51.170 --> 04:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here to
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
answer the questions
 
04:09:57.050 --> 04:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so your proposed uh fix here to the
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue that you guys see is this not the
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
way that the organization that supports
 
04:10:04.849 --> 04:10:04.859 align:start position:0%
Pace nationally wants this policy
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
implemented correct my understanding is
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
the organization CP C Pace Alliance um
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know consent is is should be a part
 
04:10:17.689 --> 04:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
of an eec pays program thank you welcome
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:26.090 --> 04:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
further questions comments yes
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
representing Kimbrell's thank you Mr
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not sure if maybe you were
 
04:10:33.170 --> 04:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
present does anybody know what the vote
 
04:10:34.969 --> 04:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
was in the science and technology and
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
energy committee and then and then
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
furthermore what it was in the house
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
so it was I want to say 17 3 or 15-5 out
 
04:10:47.330 --> 04:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
of committee and it was a Voice vote in
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
the house and uh was that OTP or it OTP
 
04:10:52.729 --> 04:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
as amended thank you you're welcome
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
you didn't happen to contact uh the
 
04:11:01.610 --> 04:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
chair right into the chair of science
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
and technology did you or I ran upstairs
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
um they were stolen in committee
 
04:11:10.130 --> 04:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
um in a hearing
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you is this
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so that a
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
municipality or can do this if they want
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
to so there was some discussion about a
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
mandate but it it really is up to a
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
district or a municipality whether they
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
want to pursue this is that right that
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that it's a it's
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
enabling the and I think you know
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
represented from the municipality could
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
speak to from the municipal Association
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that this is
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
enabling a municipality would have to
 
04:11:42.290 --> 04:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
choose I believe right now
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
believe Dover and Nashua I want to say
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
are current Pace municipalities
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so but yeah I believe that's the way
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
it works
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman leishman and
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
representatives I appreciate the
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on this bill
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
um my name is Catherine heck for the
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
record and I represent the New Hampshire
 
04:12:22.729 --> 04:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we did write a
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note both for the introduced Bill
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
and for the amended bill as well which
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
does not change the fiscal note very
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
much I am not an expert in Pace see Pace
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
or our pace which are all energy
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
programs however I did do extensive
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
research on this bill in particular so
 
04:12:42.769 --> 04:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
yes it is enabling legislation currently
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have two communities Nashua and
 
04:12:49.490 --> 04:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
Durham that are involved in a c Pace or
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
our PACE program and a little bit of
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
history is that this legislation was
 
04:12:56.050 --> 04:12:56.060 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2010 by New Hampshire
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
authorizing or enabling
 
04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
cities towns and Village districts to
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
establish Energy Efficiency in clean
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
energy districts under 53f so it allowed
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
them to create these districts and
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
incurred debt through issuing Municipal
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds for qualified energy
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
conservation projects
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
but however in 2015 the legislature
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
amended Pace legislation and removed the
 
04:13:24.889 --> 04:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
authority of municipalities to provide
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
financing so it could only be done
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
through private investors
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
um did change how of course these
 
04:13:37.010 --> 04:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
projects could be financed now this
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
particular bill as amended I think the
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
um it might be here is because at one
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
point the state treasurer was involved
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the bill was kind of
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
um complex and it's in its strategy I I
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
guess I would say
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so we did work with the sponsor a bit
 
04:13:56.330 --> 04:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
to condense the bill and just make it
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation I do not believe
 
04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
there's any fiscal impact to the state
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
as it's going to the municipalities
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
issuing these revenue bonds however it
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
is unclear how this legislation will
 
04:14:09.889 --> 04:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
impact local expenditures because we
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
don't know how many municipalities will
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
adopt it and of course it does require
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
the municipality to take on debt and of
 
04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
course there is that payback of course
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
where the bank would be the senior lien
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
holder if reamended and the municipality
 
04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be the junior lien holder so again
 
04:14:30.530 --> 04:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee however we know 38
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
states have these programs and it has
 
04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
been successful in these states in
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
bringing forward More Energy Efficiency
 
04:14:41.150 --> 04:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
so we don't have any position on the the
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
policy however we can't speak to what
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
the local impact would be should in
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
municipality take this on and if the
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
commercial property default and what
 
04:14:52.729 --> 04:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
that would cost but again I think that's
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
a local a local issue but there has been
 
04:14:58.490 --> 04:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
great success Nationwide
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
so I can certainly try to take questions
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
but I am not a pace expert by any
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
04:15:09.650 --> 04:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here and
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
sorry without the sponsor here
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
um since you did say that you helped
 
04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
work on the legislation I imagine in
 
04:15:16.729 --> 04:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
was the striking out of the current
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
policy within terms of lien holding was
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
that an intentional change or was that
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
an accidental pickup so we did want to
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
work with the bankers Association to
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
um this could be completely enacted and
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that there would be no issues
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
with banking Freddie may you know
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
Freddie Mac all of that I think there's
 
04:15:40.370 --> 04:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
been some history in the bankers
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
Association can come back up and speak
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
to that and some of these programs were
 
04:15:47.090 --> 04:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
affected by not having the correct
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
terminology and not having the correct
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
order of lean in it but it was a little
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
bit of a
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
quick turnaround to try to get
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that enabled municipalities
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
to move forward their policy priorities
 
04:16:02.929 --> 04:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
and the Energy Efficiency World well
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
combining it with the bill that we were
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
originally presented with so I think
 
04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
that peace was left out but we're
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
certainly open to adding that because I
 
04:16:12.610 --> 04:16:12.620 align:start position:0%
think that's really important
 
04:16:16.689 --> 04:16:16.699 align:start position:0%
moving forward thank you you're welcome
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney would you like to
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps work with the bankers group and
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose from Science and
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
Technology maybe bring this issue around
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:16:28.929 --> 04:16:28.939 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I'm sorry thank
 
04:16:31.199 --> 04:16:32.090 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I'm sorry thank
you

04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I've heard two things just now that
 
04:16:37.729 --> 04:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
that seem in Conflict one was that the
 
04:16:40.969 --> 04:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
money and that's being lent is private
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
and one that it's towns taking on debt
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
so which is a
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
it can be a it will be able to be a
 
04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
combination of both together or each one
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
separately under this legislation
 
04:16:57.610 --> 04:16:57.620 align:start position:0%
depending on how it is structured under
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
53f so at this time the current law only
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
allows it to be a private investor and
 
04:17:05.210 --> 04:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
the municipality is completely removed
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
from that the Miss penalty could partner
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
and do a P3 public-private partnership
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe get Summer part of that
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
funding or municipality can issue all of
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
the debt and take on all of the debt
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that used to be in legislation prior
 
04:17:22.849 --> 04:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
to 2015 is my understanding of how it
 
04:17:30.010 --> 04:17:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
currently it's private lenders correct
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes but somehow the municipality is
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
involved because they own the lien on
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
the on well they assess the property for
 
04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
something larger than it would be
 
04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
otherwise collect the payments in tax
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
and then forward those payments to the
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
private lender is that right no no
 
04:17:54.410 --> 04:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no forwarding of any
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
there's no no forwarding of any any
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
payments unless they're and then the
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
whole foreclosure process is its own
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
special and unique process should
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
anything like that occur that's a whole
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
separate issue from this program it's
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
from this program and how it would work
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is to actually move forward putting
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the solar panels and More Energy
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency in those larger commercial
 
04:18:24.530 --> 04:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
units I believe it's five five or more
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
four four
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not an expert in this this
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
program unfortunately I did try to learn
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
a whole lot about it
 
04:18:35.279 --> 04:18:36.229 align:start position:0%
a whole lot about it
um

04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
and energy New Hampshire might be
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
another place to reach out to
 
04:18:42.769 --> 04:18:42.779 align:start position:0%
um they didn't get back to us when we
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
04:18:48.050 --> 04:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
work on this legislation though
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
well one question to ask is
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
um how is this better than
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
just simply someone purchasing solar
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
panels from a vendor and paying them
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
back over time right because you know
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
you buy stuff like a car or something
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
and you pay back over time and and the
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
vendor themselves arranges financing I
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see why the towns or
 
04:19:21.490 --> 04:19:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.610 --> 04:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
I would believe yes my understanding is
 
04:19:27.769 --> 04:19:27.779 align:start position:0%
that if there's not the pub the private
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
partnership availability that the town
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
becomes the partner to move that policy
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
forward the town itself becomes the
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
partner rather than waiting for a
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
private entity to come in and become the
 
04:19:40.319 --> 04:19:41.330 align:start position:0%
private entity to come in and become the
partner

04:19:41.330 --> 04:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
partner
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my understanding there is a
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
very successful story out of Virginia
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
for a community doing this and really
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
did a whole lot of green work this way
 
04:19:53.150 --> 04:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
and reduced all their energy costs town
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
wide and did all this wonderful stuff
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
using this mod this model but this is
 
04:20:04.010 --> 04:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.170 --> 04:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I so much you'd be
 
04:20:07.490 --> 04:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
happy to work with representative
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
Sweeney and the bankers and try to work
 
04:20:12.110 --> 04:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
something through absolutely I I did
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
briefly look at the language and over a
 
04:20:16.610 --> 04:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
brief look that's it's right on point
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
with what we had already discussed so
 
04:20:20.570 --> 04:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
speak very uneducatedly about this time
 
04:20:24.889 --> 04:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
now your wealth of information as always
 
04:20:24.899 --> 04:20:28.269 align:start position:0%
now your wealth of information as always
thanks

04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions anyone
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you enjoy your new assignment
 
04:20:36.530 --> 04:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm very good
 
04:20:39.410 --> 04:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
all right we have agriculture coming in
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
at two so
 
04:33:04.609 --> 04:33:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
the former speaker and now commissioner
 
04:33:11.449 --> 04:33:11.459 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Agriculture
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
nice to see you Mr Speaker
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
it is good to be here Mr chairman
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
and I think everybody knows you but we
 
04:33:25.490 --> 04:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't know your associate so Michelle uh
 
04:33:28.250 --> 04:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
Tebow is my Administrative Assistant she
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
does all the heavy lifting when it comes
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the budget all right I'm glad you're
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
still so honest
 
04:33:40.990 --> 04:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.250 --> 04:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
well we we really didn't bring any
 
04:33:48.900 --> 04:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
well we we really didn't bring any
handouts

04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
um there's really only one thing in the
 
04:33:52.980 --> 04:33:54.769 align:start position:0%
um there's really only one thing in the
governor's

04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:33:54.779 --> 04:33:55.551 align:start position:0%
governor's
um

04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we do want to to
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
talk about we're glad to answer any
 
04:34:03.230 --> 04:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
questions or the the the main thing in
 
04:34:06.890 --> 04:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
the budget for me is finally having made
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
it this far with an assistant
 
04:34:08.400 --> 04:34:09.709 align:start position:0%
it this far with an assistant
commissioner

04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think I'm probably the only
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of a department with over
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
40 people that doesn't have an assistant
 
04:34:19.010 --> 04:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
have a a deputy who's the state
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who's busier than I am so
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't provide any
 
04:34:27.650 --> 04:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
administrative support I had intended to
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
ask for uh for an assistant
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
a couple budgets ago and a couple things
 
04:34:36.529 --> 04:34:36.539 align:start position:0%
came up and then the pandemic came up
 
04:34:40.010 --> 04:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
and so here we are and um
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's in there last year the
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
legislature approved an invasive species
 
04:34:49.730 --> 04:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
program to try to eradicate eradicate
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
the plant invasive species that we're
 
04:34:54.490 --> 04:34:54.500 align:start position:0%
seeing all over the state they put in a
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
coordinator I should say the legislature
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
approved a coordinator position with no
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
money so this year we've asked for the
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
funding for the previously approved
 
04:35:05.039 --> 04:35:06.590 align:start position:0%
funding for the previously approved
position

04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the thing that has created a little bit
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
of consternation for us and I don't know
 
04:35:14.090 --> 04:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
pages are the same as ours on the
 
04:35:20.570 --> 04:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but it was age
 
04:35:23.449 --> 04:35:23.459 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so it'd be page 250
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.689 --> 04:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
so for
 
04:35:36.410 --> 04:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
many years going back in history there
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
was a
 
04:35:38.160 --> 04:35:38.929 align:start position:0%
was a
um

04:35:38.929 --> 04:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:38.939 --> 04:35:41.209 align:start position:0%
um
contract

04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:35:43.789 --> 04:35:43.799 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the state Conservation
 
04:35:43.799 --> 04:35:45.170 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the state Conservation
Commission

04:35:45.170 --> 04:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
there were some problems my
 
04:35:49.090 --> 04:35:49.100 align:start position:0%
understanding is with that individual
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
and they ended the contract never did
 
04:35:55.131 --> 04:35:55.141 align:start position:0%
anything and so then the the 10
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
districts that make up the state
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission obviously the I
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say Obviously but they are
 
04:36:04.609 --> 04:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
made up of the ten counties were sort of
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
floundering with no coordination
 
04:36:09.890 --> 04:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
in the last budget we did move get that
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
move to a part-time position
 
04:36:16.250 --> 04:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
we have a great individual in there it's
 
04:36:19.131 --> 04:36:19.141 align:start position:0%
been well well established that this is
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
worthy of full-time and the person that
 
04:36:24.051 --> 04:36:24.061 align:start position:0%
we have won't be staying with us if we
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
don't get this to a full-time position
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
or will we ever have anybody long term
 
04:36:29.631 --> 04:36:29.641 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood
 
04:36:33.170 --> 04:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
and what happened was well wait a minute
 
04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't you shuffled
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
I shuffled my pages around so
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
what did I do
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's in my stack here but I can
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
basically I'll let her look for that
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
sorry about that but what happened we
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
had forty thousand dollars in for the
 
04:36:52.609 --> 04:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
part-time position continuing and then
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
small amount of the benefits that go
 
04:36:57.769 --> 04:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
along with that we requested the
 
04:36:59.689 --> 04:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
full-time position
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
so we had taken out the part-time
 
04:37:02.520 --> 04:37:04.070 align:start position:0%
so we had taken out the part-time
position

04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then the governor took out
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
the full amount so now we're left with
 
04:37:10.561 --> 04:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
the full amount so now we're left with
nobody

04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
in this budget
 
04:37:14.219 --> 04:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
in this budget
um

04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have a revolving fund
 
04:37:21.289 --> 04:37:21.299 align:start position:0%
this the total cost is 93 000 with
 
04:37:24.410 --> 04:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
Benefits it's 56 I think in salary the
 
04:37:27.170 --> 04:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
first year and then the rest in in
 
04:37:27.180 --> 04:37:29.390 align:start position:0%
first year and then the rest in in
benefits

04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
the conservation fund can fund this
 
04:37:36.769 --> 04:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
position thank you
 
04:37:40.250 --> 04:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
and so while we were
 
04:37:43.010 --> 04:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
hoping that the general fund would
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
um Pitch in on this there is there are
 
04:37:47.929 --> 04:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
adequate funds in there to sustain this
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
for a while most of the money is given
 
04:37:52.490 --> 04:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
out in Grants
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
the conservation districts for products
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
such as stream restoration any number of
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
things is generally three to four
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars that's given
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
out a year the fund has about 1.2 in it
 
04:38:07.849 --> 04:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:38:07.859 --> 04:38:08.810 align:start position:0%
right now
um

04:38:08.810 --> 04:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so I would highly recommend and ask
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
that this position be restored
 
04:38:16.250 --> 04:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I haven't had the
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to anybody in the
 
04:38:19.131 --> 04:38:19.141 align:start position:0%
governor's office because I was gone
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
last week
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I had requested previous to have a
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
conversation but
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
um that was before the governor's budget
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
was submitted so maybe talking a little
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
out of school but this is my opportunity
 
04:38:34.250 --> 04:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
to to do the ask and to do it without
 
04:38:37.369 --> 04:38:37.379 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
um to fund that position
 
04:38:41.810 --> 04:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
restore it to the budget
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes represent evil
 
04:39:01.730 --> 04:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
I was trying to welcome and good to see
 
04:39:04.730 --> 04:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
you I was just trying to um
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
to figure this out so the first thing is
 
04:39:11.470 --> 04:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
that you would like to have an assistant
 
04:39:14.689 --> 04:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner because you haven't had one
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
and did you say I'm sorry I don't I'm
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
taking notes I don't have my book so is
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the was the funding put in for this okay
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
yes both of the the two previous
 
04:39:26.330 --> 04:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
positions are funded this one was not
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
but it it actually moved backwards okay
 
04:39:31.131 --> 04:39:31.141 align:start position:0%
and then you
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
how does the invasive species program
 
04:39:37.010 --> 04:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
work under agriculture because I know
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
Des is also responsible for invasive
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
species or how
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what what they do we work
 
04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
on eradication we have a person who's
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
devoted part of his time to doing this
 
04:39:56.330 --> 04:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
and odion park is a prime example of
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of the is one of the projects where
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
he's he's worked now this is always in
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration with others usually it can
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
be local conservation commissions can be
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state highway department local
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
Highway departments
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
any organization that may be
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
interested in in cleaning out an area of
 
04:40:18.890 --> 04:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
invasive species and in the past we have
 
04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
worked well with DOT on roadside but
 
04:40:25.010 --> 04:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
we're losing the battle and this is his
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
part-time job there was a fund
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
established I think with a hundred and
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand to give out grants to
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
various communities
 
04:40:37.730 --> 04:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
but they also need the education we need
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in this position full-time who
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
can be devoting their time to dealing
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
with this if you've ever been down to
 
04:40:47.448 --> 04:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
Hartford Connecticut you've seen the
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
areas where you think you may be in a
 
04:40:50.570 --> 04:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
foreign jungle
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to look like if
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.208 --> 04:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
so okay I think I so I think Des
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for invasive
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
steps in water that is right this is
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
simply you're responsible for what's on
 
04:41:09.890 --> 04:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
on the on the land yes and you have a
 
04:41:09.900 --> 04:41:12.288 align:start position:0%
on the on the land yes and you have a
coordinate

04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
well that's not his title he's an
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
inspector he is sort of because he's
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
passionate about it he's taken on a lot
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities of trying to uh
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with this
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we want somebody who will focus on
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
this full-time
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
and what's the funding situation on that
 
04:41:39.050 --> 04:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to unwind everything
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
here so there's the state conservation
 
04:41:45.770 --> 04:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
districts and then you had a coordinator
 
04:41:49.128 --> 04:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
who was part-time but that position has
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
been removed and there's no funding
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
apparently story right yeah if you're if
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
if you're on page 256 and you you see
 
04:41:58.500 --> 04:42:01.128 align:start position:0%
if you're on page 256 and you you see
um

04:42:01.128 --> 04:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
cost center 50 Personnel Service
 
04:42:07.850 --> 04:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
temporary appointee and there's 40 462.
 
04:42:09.890 --> 04:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then you follow that across there's
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
no money there
 
04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
so what the governor and the budget here
 
04:42:17.208 --> 04:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
we had requested
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
it in cost center 10.
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
and they took that out but not realizing
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
that they were then totally defunding
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
the position oh
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
so I think you know and that's very
 
04:42:30.050 --> 04:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
understandable with the amount of work
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
they have to do and the time they have
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
to do it in so
 
04:42:34.798 --> 04:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
to do it in so
um

04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
that it that's the issue there and I
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
would point out to the uh to the
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee that the Department of
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
Agriculture if you take out
 
04:42:46.970 --> 04:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
the some of the grants that we have such
 
04:42:48.650 --> 04:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
as for
 
04:42:51.170 --> 04:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
um land conservation maybe even within
 
04:42:51.180 --> 04:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
um land conservation maybe even within
that

04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're cash positive we produce more
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state than we spent
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the tune of anywhere from two hundred
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
thousand to a million dollars a year
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
so we are not a drain on the on the
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I was hoping this money could
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
come from from the general fund so that
 
04:43:14.090 --> 04:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
there'd be money available for the
 
04:43:16.490 --> 04:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
grants but it is important to all the
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
districts everybody really has
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
appreciated over the last year and a
 
04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
half that this individual has been on
 
04:43:25.490 --> 04:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
what a different has been making in
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
coordinating the works of the 10
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
districts because without an executive
 
04:43:32.090 --> 04:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
director the state Conservation
 
04:43:32.100 --> 04:43:33.350 align:start position:0%
director the state Conservation
Commission

04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
well largely
 
04:43:35.400 --> 04:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
well largely
um

04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't have a center doesn't
 
04:43:40.850 --> 04:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
have that coordination that is so
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin followed by
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kim brawls thank you
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
04:43:54.770 --> 04:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
um so where are you proposing this money
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
I I would say that if you do not wish to
 
04:44:02.090 --> 04:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
give it to us from the general fund it
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
can come from the uh from that fund and
 
04:44:08.810 --> 04:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
I have messed up my paperwork the
 
04:44:12.850 --> 04:44:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
is soil conservation uh fund it's a
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
revolving fund
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:44:21.360 --> 04:44:23.330 align:start position:0%
and uh
yeah

04:44:23.330 --> 04:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
and it has about 1.2 million in it at
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.798 --> 04:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at page 256 what line
 
04:44:39.170 --> 04:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
reflects that fund well it
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't be increased well when when
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
you go to estimated source of funds it's
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
not broken down
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
here but it's other funds yep that's
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
where the money would come from I can't
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
tell you I understand how these things
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
work because they certainly are nothing
 
04:44:58.510 --> 04:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
like a municipal budget so
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me we're still trying ourselves
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so but that is where I'm sure LBA
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
knows how to do that
 
04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's
 
04:45:19.010 --> 04:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned your typically net
 
04:45:25.490 --> 04:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
positive in terms of money coming in
 
04:45:27.890 --> 04:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
what are your sources of revenue so
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
largely the main sources of revenue we
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
have are from pesticides licensing so
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
every pesticides product that is used in
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
the state has to be registered with the
 
04:45:43.850 --> 04:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
state I think right now 75 percent of
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
that fund stays in a revolving fund 25
 
04:45:48.830 --> 04:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
goes to general fund
 
04:45:52.730 --> 04:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.970 --> 04:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
product registration on the animal
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh products if you pet foods and Grains
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
fertilizers lime any of those things
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
that are registered also have a fee that
 
04:46:08.690 --> 04:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
come in and I think currently that's a
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
50 50 split I think there's a bill in
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
the works to change that not one that we
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
had had requested but
 
04:46:17.520 --> 04:46:18.830 align:start position:0%
had had requested but
um

04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
make things a lot less convoluted
 
04:46:21.120 --> 04:46:22.190 align:start position:0%
make things a lot less convoluted
although

04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
although
 
04:46:24.288 --> 04:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not the biggest fan of revolving
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
funds myself but um
 
04:46:28.730 --> 04:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
they certainly have served this
 
04:46:28.740 --> 04:46:29.868 align:start position:0%
they certainly have served this
department

04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:46:32.448 --> 04:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
well and they do stay within the areas
 
04:46:35.810 --> 04:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
to support the department so can I have
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question uh and yes um I'm
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
very familiar with invasive species in
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the water because I'm on a Lincoln
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
Association what what um what invasive
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
species in particular are on the land
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing um Bittersweet is in
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
my opinion one of the worst because it's
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
strangling off the trees and killing
 
04:46:54.600 --> 04:46:56.330 align:start position:0%
strangling off the trees and killing
them

04:46:56.330 --> 04:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:46:58.610 --> 04:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
um then we have the Japanese knotweed
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
which is just ever expanding uh we see
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
that all over the place in fields and on
 
04:47:07.010 --> 04:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
the sides of the highways uh tree of
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
Heaven which I am not terribly familiar
 
04:47:14.810 --> 04:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
with myself but that is also what the um
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
spotted a lanternfly
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
likes to um
 
04:47:22.368 --> 04:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
feed off of and and that is a problem
 
04:47:27.530 --> 04:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
for primarily for the grapes that's that
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thing has been coming in we've been
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
doing a pretty good job of keeping it
 
04:47:34.730 --> 04:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
out at this at this point by Nursery
 
04:47:37.490 --> 04:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
inspections because that's primarily how
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
it comes in but that's a real problem
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's a growing problem
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
um in Pennsylvania and the surrounding
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
areas it's not officially here yet but
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we can eliminate that it's host that
 
04:47:52.128 --> 04:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
will help in the long term
 
04:47:52.138 --> 04:47:59.470 align:start position:0%
will help in the long term
okay

04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
oh sorry so if someone wanted assistance
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
from your department to deal with uh in
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
eradication of invasive species how how
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
would they go about it well they would
 
04:48:12.840 --> 04:48:14.090 align:start position:0%
would they go about it well they would
contact

04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
contact
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
UM plan industry we don't do work on
 
04:48:19.550 --> 04:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
private property
 
04:48:21.650 --> 04:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
we do give them
 
04:48:23.930 --> 04:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
the education we give them the advice
 
04:48:26.810 --> 04:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
they need to do that themselves
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
so primarily we're working on on state
 
04:48:33.650 --> 04:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
land Town state land right of ways
 
04:48:36.530 --> 04:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
things like that but our advising in
 
04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
those areas we do I think have the
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
ability in certain cases probably to
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
make a declaration and go on to private
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
property if it is
 
04:48:45.958 --> 04:48:46.788 align:start position:0%
property if it is
um

04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely
 
04:48:52.490 --> 04:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
extreme concern I'm not aware that we've
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
done that and I'm not a hundred percent
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
sure on that it's just something
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
rattling around in the back of my head
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
about that if we find somebody who isn't
 
04:48:59.878 --> 04:49:04.070 align:start position:0%
about that if we find somebody who isn't
cooperative

04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
no just to comment um I I have my son
 
04:49:10.010 --> 04:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
lives in New York and they have the tree
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
of Heaven there and it's just taking
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
over all the trees yeah
 
04:49:15.240 --> 04:49:16.490 align:start position:0%
over all the trees yeah
terrible

04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
yes and that's this is a huge a huge
 
04:49:22.128 --> 04:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
concern and we we need to do more in the
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
area of Education largely these are
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
going to be projects that one person is
 
04:49:30.770 --> 04:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
not going to to do by himself and
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
rehearsal going to be working with
 
04:49:33.360 --> 04:49:34.670 align:start position:0%
rehearsal going to be working with
conservation

04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
commissions districts to to really get
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
push that information out there and
 
04:49:44.330 --> 04:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully as a as a team we'll be able
 
04:49:48.288 --> 04:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.208 --> 04:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you commissioner for
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
being here uh this morning we had a work
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
session on HB 230 from representative
 
04:50:00.530 --> 04:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
Bixby for an electronic data processing
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
system for all registrations under your
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
purview is that funding included in the
 
04:50:07.310 --> 04:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
budget or is it something you would
 
04:50:09.170 --> 04:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
support no that is that's a separate
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
bill it's not in in the budget and
 
04:50:14.570 --> 04:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
it will allow us to do more of what
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be be doing
 
04:50:20.090 --> 04:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
um my joke has been by the time I'm done
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
being commissioner I want to bring us
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
but hopefully with that bill and others
 
04:50:31.150 --> 04:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
we'll actually get into the 21st century
 
04:50:34.010 --> 04:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
the amount of man hours that we are
 
04:50:34.020 --> 04:50:35.208 align:start position:0%
the amount of man hours that we are
spending

04:50:35.208 --> 04:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
spending
 
04:50:37.730 --> 04:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
bringing in the physical paperwork and
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
then entering it into programs is
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
mind-boggling and frankly you know we do
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
have well underway the animal database
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
which was approved some years ago and is
 
04:50:50.580 --> 04:50:52.490 align:start position:0%
which was approved some years ago and is
actually

04:50:52.490 --> 04:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
um we will be awarding a bid on that
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully by about July 1st God knows
 
04:51:00.410 --> 04:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
how long it'll take to develop it but
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is for the the other programs that
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
we need weights and measures has been a
 
04:51:07.368 --> 04:51:07.378 align:start position:0%
real disaster that was literally the one
 
04:51:09.890 --> 04:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
developed in the 80s by a sex offender
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
at the state prison
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the source code so if
 
04:51:16.910 --> 04:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
you go any place that has a license for
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
weights and measures you'll notice
 
04:51:21.530 --> 04:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's a sticker with my name on it
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
over former commissioner Merrills
 
04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
name because nobody can get into the
 
04:51:30.170 --> 04:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
system and actually change her name to
 
04:51:30.180 --> 04:51:31.788 align:start position:0%
system and actually change her name to
mine

04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
mine
 
04:51:34.610 --> 04:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's how bad it is
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
so so I take it you're supportive of hpg
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
and just a follow-up to representative
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
Sweeney's question the fiscal note
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
indicates there's no General funds to
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
support this system
 
04:51:58.970 --> 04:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.980 --> 04:52:00.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:52:00.250 --> 04:52:00.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:52:02.810 --> 04:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
we didn't know what we didn't know until
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
we finally had somebody from doit
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
embedded into the department
 
04:52:10.970 --> 04:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know I I came into it new assuming
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay doit is looking out for our needs
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
and we'll be somewhere in the cube
 
04:52:18.170 --> 04:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
once we got somebody to manage the
 
04:52:19.730 --> 04:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
database we realized nobody was really
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking out for our our needs and we had
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be our own advocates
 
04:52:28.910 --> 04:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
which we were with the database but uh
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
certainly been an eye-opening experience
 
04:52:31.620 --> 04:52:33.050 align:start position:0%
certainly been an eye-opening experience
with

04:52:33.050 --> 04:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:52:34.730 --> 04:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
what has so far been a failed
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
replacement system for weights and
 
04:52:36.660 --> 04:52:38.208 align:start position:0%
replacement system for weights and
measures

04:52:38.208 --> 04:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
measures
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.150 --> 04:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the
 
04:52:47.160 --> 04:52:48.948 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the
commissioner

04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
I guess seeing none of the division have
 
04:53:00.600 --> 04:53:01.550 align:start position:0%
I guess seeing none of the division have
a

04:53:01.550 --> 04:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:53:03.368 --> 04:53:03.378 align:start position:0%
reference and what we do with the
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural budget
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
except it is presented with that fact
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
that we may have to make some changes
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
once we get the numbers for
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
the revenues
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
I guess you don't have to come back
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and we'll we'll act on uh
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 230 at some point as well all
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much appreciate
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
your time
 
04:53:28.730 --> 04:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
and your service and all the long hours
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
that await you moving forward
 
04:53:33.530 --> 04:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman could you get together with
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and staff as far as a
 
04:53:38.448 --> 04:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
specific language for that uh position
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that won't be funded with General funds
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
make a footnote somewhere
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
I have the information from the agency
 
04:53:50.090 --> 04:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
requests okay I have everything I need
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
all right put it right in hospital one
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
so as a reminder to the division we have
 
04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
a joint session with division three at 2
 
04:54:15.180 --> 04:54:16.610 align:start position:0%
a joint session with division three at 2
30.

04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
30.
 
04:54:16.620 --> 04:54:18.310 align:start position:0%
30.
so

04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:23.390 --> 04:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
Could You Reach Out Mr Hoffman to doit
 
04:54:45.600 --> 04:54:46.730 align:start position:0%
Could You Reach Out Mr Hoffman to doit
and

04:54:46.730 --> 04:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:48.650 --> 04:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
see if they've weighed in on House Bill
 
04:54:48.660 --> 04:54:50.090 align:start position:0%
