00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly sure what this
 
00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.310 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly sure what this
transportation

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
part of this is all about
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
part of this is all about
and

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
how are we
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
we just don't understand it it's not
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to it we just don't
 
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to it we just don't
understand

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
how and what
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
is going on
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
so let me try and clarify that for you
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
and otherwise kelly can lean in on some
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the details as well
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
but basically we've received an
 
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.710 align:start position:0%
but basically we've received an
additional

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
source of funds from the federal
 
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
source of funds from the federal
government

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
for our food and nutrition programs
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
to be able to support our food programs
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
in some of the additional costs that
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
they have incurred as a result of some
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the supply chain issues that have
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
happened in the across the country so
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulty in terms of getting uh
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
food and supplies to the school to be
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
able to do it maybe they have to pay
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
expedited charges or they've got
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
additional costs associated with that
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
and so these funds will essentially
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
other than a small part be passed
 
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
other than a small part be passed
through

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
to the districts to be able to support
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
the increased cost associated with
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
supply chain you know constraints that's
 
00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
supply chain you know constraints that's
it

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:31.350 align:start position:0%
okay so
basically

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
the schools will ask for reimbursement
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is a certain amount five thousand
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
dollars that gets disbursed to every sau
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining amount the
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
remaining amount
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
is dispersed based on the
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
meal counts from onion21
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
in for this and they or they can not
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
choose to take the funds and obviously
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
change the amount that the and the
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
formula that that each school would get
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
to okay so it's based on meals served
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know other than the five thousand
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
there any further questions
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
i have a tangential question if i may
 
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.629 align:start position:0%
i have a tangential question if i may
certainly

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.749 align:start position:0%
certainly
uh

00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in mr commissioner i i
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
started a conversation with dhhs a
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
couple fiscal committees ago i had a
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
constituent call me up she works in a
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
nearby school district
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
and she
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
hammered me as good as i've been
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
hammered in a long time
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
about the extra burden
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
that the schools were bearing in order
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
to keep up with all the covid19
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.269 align:start position:0%
to keep up with all the covid19
reporting

00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.629 align:start position:0%
reporting
and

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that's primarily a
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
task that's going to the schools
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
but i i just wanted to make you you
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
aware of it and ask you
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
if if you were aware of the schools
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
complaining about what feels to them as
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
a truly excessive workload around covid
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
reporting and can i just clarify you
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
saying specific to food and nutrition
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
programming or broadly no this is
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
tangential it's completely different
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's about covid
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
reporting i'm just using the fact that
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
you're up here on the nutrition to ask
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
you about something you're completely
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
unprepared for no actually i'm i'm quite
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
prepared for that so it's no problem at
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
all i because there was a significant
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
amount of reporting that was taking
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
place from our schools associated with
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
cases and contact racing
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
over time that has come down and on
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
february 23rd with the
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
update of the recommendations by public
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
health around some of the coveted
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.669 align:start position:0%
health around some of the coveted
protocols

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of reporting by the schools
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
has been substantially reduced
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so there is some reporting that
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
continues but a significant amount of
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
that has been that burden has been taken
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
away from them
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the sidebar i just asked
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
because the constituent was so fired up
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
yeah yep so i think we've taken care of
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
much of that thank you
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
54 plus in

federal cares act funding so
 
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
federal cares act funding so
um

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
my question on this is that
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
i had thought
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
that all cares act money
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
had to have been allocated by
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
31 december
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so i was just
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
a little confused
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
what was going on with the cares money
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
care exact money sure so i do believe
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
that that applied to the cares act funds
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
that were um appropriated through gopher
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
but there were many cares act funds that
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
were appropriated directly to the
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
department through that bill
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
and with this grant it is good until
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it and the dates of when the grants
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
expired from the cares act depended on
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
where the funding
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
where the funding was granted to and
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
this one was directly to the department
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a two-part question i'll
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
ask it in one
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
um it says that this is to support the
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
survey and certification activities
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
and i was i was just curious if you
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
could characterize
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
what all goes into the survey and then
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
on the certification piece
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
what what what utility does that
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
certification serve does it authorize
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
receipt of funds from something or
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
why bother with the certification
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
you for the record my name is melissa
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
since here i'm the chief legal officer
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the department of health and human
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
services and i oversee the bureau of
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification uh relative
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
to this survey and certification the
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
question that you just had
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
of quality and care that's provided to
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
residents that live in nursing homes so
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's every aspect of medical
 
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.190 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's every aspect of medical
treatment

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's all aspects of the environment food
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
service every everything that they
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
possibly could be receiving treatment or
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
care for at the nursing home so these
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
surveyors go in and do that
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
the in doing so if they found them in
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
compliance of with cms regulations they
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
then are certified that facility becomes
 
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.549 align:start position:0%
then are certified that facility becomes
certified

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
to provide services to medicare
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
recipients and medicaid recipients so
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the certification is for
 
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.149 align:start position:0%
that's what the certification is for
so

00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.430 align:start position:0%
so
follow-up

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up so what would be the impact if
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
um if they didn't get a certification
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
if they did not get their certification
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
they could lose all medicare funding and
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
not be able to provide services to
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept fis 22
 
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept fis 22

okay
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go off on something else
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
no i didn't forget about it
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
he wasn't here
 
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
he wasn't here
okay

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
this is a perfect place to bring up our
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
mr arlinghaus
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
promised us that
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
by this meeting he would have hired his
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
three temporary positions for
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
working to
 
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
working to
gain

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
gain
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
employees in the state
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
so that's my first question is how are
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
we doing on that
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh well but
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
well so at our i'm gonna i'm gonna
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
take issue
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
not really but
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
i said give me a month
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
not a month from the date we were
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
speaking but a month from when we had
 
00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.070 align:start position:0%
speaking but a month from when we had
permission

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
right so uh our meeting was february
 
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.549 align:start position:0%
right so uh our meeting was february
18th

00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
18th
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
the governor and council approval which
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
is required for this item
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
was march 9th
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
i can't post a position before march 9th
 
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.710 align:start position:0%
i can't post a position before march 9th
so

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
um we did a whole lot of work between
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
the council between this meeting and the
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
council meeting on the presumption and
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
normally i don't let people do work on
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
this presumption if it requires fiscal
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
and governor and council approval just
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
keep your shirt on until they both
 
00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:59.350 align:start position:0%
keep your shirt on until they both
approve

00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
because that
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
because you know who knows what happens
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
at governor and council obviously you're
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
a very reasonable wonderful body
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
but them who knows um and and they're a
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable wonderful body too for the
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
record if somebody's taking notes
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.269 align:start position:0%
record if somebody's taking notes
um

00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that meeting was march 29th we won't
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
put that in the minutes thank you i
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
so that meeting was march 9th and we
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
posted the position on march 10th
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
so which is pretty good i think i mean i
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
suppose theoretically we could have
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
gotten it up that afternoon but that's
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
silly um
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
position postings in the state process
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
require they be posted internally for a
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
period of time um typically five
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
business days was yesterday um
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we are likely to
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
extend the posting although evaluate
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
what we've so far but extend the posting
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
externally for five days
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's a standard work unit and it might
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
be seven days because it's five business
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
days um
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
at which point we have uh i actually
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
asked somebody to pull this for me
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
asked somebody to pull this for me
wednesday

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
so there are three positions we've
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
received four applications
 
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.789 align:start position:0%
received four applications
um

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are one or two of them that may or
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
may not certify they're reviewing it to
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that they do the certification
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
process is
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
moderately cumbersome in the state
 
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.029 align:start position:0%
moderately cumbersome in the state
system

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
which is why we're probably going to go
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
external but we have in the meantime
 
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.669 align:start position:0%
external but we have in the meantime
developed

00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.470 align:start position:0%
developed
a

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
recruiting and marketing plan
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
a general business plan including
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
metrics and goals uh there is position
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
work underway pulling positions across
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
state government and vacancy rates
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
um to figure out uh which positions that
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to target first um i would
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
describe that as underway but the the
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
woman the the analyst doing that work
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
for us carolyn russell happens to be her
 
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.789 align:start position:0%
for us carolyn russell happens to be her
name

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
is fairly far advanced on that when we
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
talked about it a week ago
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
she seemed pretty clear on on at least
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
about half the positions they're going
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
to look at so i would expect that we
 
00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:09.669 align:start position:0%
to look at so i would expect that we
will

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
have hired all three positions
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
within a month
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the governor and council meeting
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you're tricking me i i'm really
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
trying hard too yes yeah i i i got it
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay so next month
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
in april next month i i'll actually have
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
names for you okay
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
so but
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
and it's important i know i know my
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
opening was a little bit silly but
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
just because those three bodies have not
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
been hired doesn't mean that a lot of
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
work isn't being done by people who
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
already have too much on their plate and
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
so you know this is this has been
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
prioritized and is being and is being
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
worked on um i mean frankly not just by
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh carolyn is a very
 
00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:01.669 align:start position:0%
you know uh carolyn is a very
personality

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
she was instead of the rest of the
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
department because of the importance of
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
this but she has she has three other
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
major projects that i'm constantly
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
harassing her about um and the director
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
of personnel is directly involved on
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
this herself and everybody else the only
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
person not directly involved on it is me
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
i just ask them what they're doing and
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay um one of our concerns and the
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
reason i asked you to come up now
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
is because we have the
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
oh the department of business and
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
economic affairs looking for three
 
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
economic affairs looking for three
people

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.389 align:start position:0%
people
and

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
so that's
four

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:57.669 align:start position:0%
four
additional

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
part-time people
 
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
part-time people
and

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
the the concern that we have
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate which i guess you had
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
provided to us you know is this is just
 
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.549 align:start position:0%
provided to us you know is this is just
on

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
full-time people
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
was at 18
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that we know what our
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
vacancies are on these
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
part-time positions or not part-time but
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
temporary positions
 
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.010 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
and so
[Music]

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
i would venture to say over the last
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
six months or so we've probably
 
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.470 align:start position:0%
six months or so we've probably
approved

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
25 or 30 and maybe more uh
 
00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.269 align:start position:0%
25 or 30 and maybe more uh
part-time

00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
i keep using that word temporary
 
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.590 align:start position:0%
i keep using that word temporary
positions

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.269 align:start position:0%
positions
um

00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
we have no idea where those are on the
 
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.070 align:start position:0%
we have no idea where those are on the
um

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
on the hiring process
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
because every person that talked to us
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
told us that if we didn't have these
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
temporary positions we couldn't do the
 
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
temporary positions we couldn't do the
work

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
is the work stopped
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
are we able to
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know you just said that even though
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have these people the work is
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
still going on
 
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.310 align:start position:0%
still going on
but

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
that didn't seem to be the feedback
 
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
that didn't seem to be the feedback
that

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
at least i was getting from the other
 
00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.470 align:start position:0%
at least i was getting from the other
agencies

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
well i i hate to say that it's
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
complicated but oh i know it is but i'm
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple things first of
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
all you you uh mr kane nicely provided
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
me the sheets so this sheet you know
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
their their vacancy rate is about 18
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
statewide is much higher among class 59
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
than it is among class 10s right your
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
your full-time permanent positions are
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
is lower than that
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
the the nature of a class 59 is it's
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to be higher because it's approved
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to find somebody when
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
you're in a tight market it takes a long
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
time to find somebody
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
why do people ask for a position even
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
though they have a vacancy because it's
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the state and you have to you have so
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use an example i have a
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
vacant internal auditor and i made a
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
decision for about three years not to
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
fill it on purpose even though it's
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
funded because we had a lapse target we
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
had to hit and i needed to use that to
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
hit the laps target i had to carefully
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
look at and not fill let's say for the
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
sake of argument you had said no last
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
month um
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
and you can't hire anybody to do
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
recruitment and i'd go oh you know what
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use the internal auditor to
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
do recruitment you're not allowed to
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
that would be illegal i'm not i'm not
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually i can temporarily assign people
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do things but i can't hire some i
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
would hire somebody with an audit
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
background because i have to have an
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
audit background that sjd has to be
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
approved the salary is set based on
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
those duties and you you can't like i
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a building service worker
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
being paid as an internal auditor
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's not permissible in the system
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
so i can't use that position for that
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
some are more fungible some are less
 
00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
some are more fungible some are less
fungible

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
fungible
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's very true on part-timers too you
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
know i have i have right now in our
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
department 48 or 49 vacancies among
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
building service workers
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
which are
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
mostly part-time unlikely to ever go
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
down because
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know why would you clean toilets for
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
the state when you could work at dunkin
 
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
the state when you could work at dunkin
donuts

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
donuts
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it's uh and that's a thing
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't help me in some other areas
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
so some of when when an agency asks you
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
for funding is going to be based on that
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they can't they have positions that
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
they can't repurpose for that
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
for some of the grant funding and things
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
um i want to hire somebody into a
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
position that is a class 59 not a class
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.549 align:start position:0%
position that is a class 59 not a class
10

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
because it is going to go away when the
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
funding goes away and i don't want to
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
create a permanent position i can't
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
create a permanent position based on
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
temporary funding and so
 
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
temporary funding and so
um

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's an element where this
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
is sort of a nice thing for the employee
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
too that you're hiring someone in and
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
you you're basically saying to them at
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
the front end i hope you understand and
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm being upfront with you that this is
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
based on a grant it's why it's called a
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary if you do a good job
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and we keep getting the grant we'll keep
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
you but it might go away in two years
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and your position will go away in two
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
years so some of it is about what
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
position is what position
 
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
position is what position
um

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
and and you look at it
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's also no agency i suspect sitting
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
behind us who thinks
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm planning an 18 vacancy rate for the
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's trying to fill positions
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
obviously i mean you know that
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
and um and they think
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks that next week i'm
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
going to get lucky
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
and you know next week this is actually
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to happen and that the resumes
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
that came in this week are not
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
indicative of what's going to come in
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
next week that suddenly something's
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
going to happen and
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
all those 26 year olds who have decided
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
they don't want to work anymore
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to wake up and decide they
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
want to work and and i don't know that
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's all 26 year olds but my
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's a that's a
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
demographic that's hurting us right now
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're pushing and you're pushing and
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're pushing you know we have a we
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
have a we have some areas where we've
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
had a lot of luck in filling positions
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i and i think to myself
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know what hiring problem and then we
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
have a couple of areas where we're you
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
know computer profession professionals
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.389 align:start position:0%
for example
where

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
wow this is really hard so i think
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's some of what goes on with
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
at a previous fiscal meeting and i don't
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
know if it was the last one or maybe the
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
one before that
 
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.470 align:start position:0%
one before that
we

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
were asked to approve
 
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.950 align:start position:0%
were asked to approve
eight

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
for hampstead hospital
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
and appropriate some
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
funds i think it was and we did that
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
but now there's a piece of legislation
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
moving through the senate
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
that wants to
 
00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:13.349 align:start position:0%
that wants to
add

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:14.790 align:start position:0%
add
six

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and doesn't
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate any money
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate any money
so

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think the money we appropriated in
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal would pay for those
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
six positions but it feels to me like we
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
over appropriated money and over created
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
positions because what happens to the
 
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.430 align:start position:0%
positions because what happens to the
eight

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
we created so i can talk about the
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
generics of
 
00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
generics of
that

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
admittedly very unusual and and rarely
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
used process but i suspect the specifics
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
are maybe we could ask karen rounds to
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
good morning karen rounds to financial
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
officer health and human services um
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
so these six
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions that were
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
created with that arpa item as charlie
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned was a little bit of an unusual
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
situation right we are purchasing
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
hampstead and need to stand up some of
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
even before we can get the operating
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
budget to you those positions are
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
currently posted
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
those six positions are intended to be
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
replaced by the six unclassified
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
positions so those six non-classified
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
positions would be eliminated
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
and if it it's you know makes
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
people more comfortable to put right
 
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.069 align:start position:0%
people more comfortable to put right
into

00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
the senate bill that these positions
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
will replace those positions that the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
department is completely agreeable to
 
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.829 align:start position:0%
department is completely agreeable to
that

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
um the reason that the unclassified
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
positions are so important is that the
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions don't have a
 
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions don't have a
salary

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
salary
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
grading system they are positions that
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
are authorized by the governor and so we
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
need to have the unclassified positions
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
to go through the jcec process and
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
assure that we set the salaries at the
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate place now we have a pretty
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
good sense of where they will land based
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
on other positions in the department but
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that those
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
positions are established appropriately
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
through that unclassified process and
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the salaries are established
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately so that's the reason that
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
we've set those up now because we cannot
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
create an unclassified position
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
without going through the legislative
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
process so we are creating a
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
non-classified position until the
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions are created
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
now i know that there was some
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion that
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could wait until the budget
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
process to create the unclassified
 
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
process to create the unclassified
position

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
i think the um the reason that i
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't suggest that uh is that the
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
non-classifi the unclassified positions
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
once they're created will need to go
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
through the jcec process which can take
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
several months and so if those are
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
created now in this legislative session
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
sometime in the next fiscal year 23 we
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
will be able to move those people into
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
an unclassified position eliminate the
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions and then they
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
will be established and properly
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the 2425 budget
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
as far as whether we've double budgeted
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
the funding for those no we won't be
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
double budgeting them we will make sure
 
00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
double budgeting them we will make sure
that

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
when we bring forward the operating
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
budget there is a balance between what
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
we expect than
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
the unclassified positions to be
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
completed by jcec in the operating
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
budget and we won't be double budgeting
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you that is helpful and
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll help us
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
write an amendment to senate bill 430
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
but aren't those positions
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
the positions we created here were
 
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
the positions we created here were
non-clinical

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
non-clinical
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
and the bill's positions i think are
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
clinical i don't believe so they're
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
intended to replace those six positions
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're specific in the
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill as to what the position titles are
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
if that
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
corrects yes so um but yes we will get
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
you some language to add to that
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
excellent i'm sure senator daniels and
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
gaia and i will appreciate that thank
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh commissioner
 
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.750 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh commissioner
arlinghaus

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
mr arlinghaus i i i'm looking at um a
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
document you may have seen but it's
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
essentially a spreadsheet of about 49
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
departments and sub departments for
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
which we have total and vacant full-time
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
classified funded positions
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
it's something that mr cain has handed
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
out to us yes okay so um
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
back in the old days when i did some
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
manpower analysis i i kept track of the
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
space availability uh next to it
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
and and i i'm just curious
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh what your process is for making sure
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
space to put these folks if we hire them
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
all i you know
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
like do you keep a red yellow green kind
 
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.470 align:start position:0%
like do you keep a red yellow green kind
of

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
process where
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
we're red if we just don't have a future
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
place to put them and green if
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything's okay or how do you do it we
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
so we typically
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
so we typically
uh

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.349 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
haphazardly is probably a good answer um
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's not literally true but um
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
space is assigned in buildings and and
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
generally the way uh life works is uh
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
the occupying army keeps the space that
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
they've been assigned unless somebody
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
has proof that they don't need it i mean
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
once uh once the department lays claim
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
to a land area it's sometimes it's hard
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
to take it away from them we we will
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
make adjustments and it statutorily that
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
is my authority and somebody said to me
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
you can just kick them out of the
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
building and i'm like yeah and then i
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
got to find somewhere for them to go and
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
and you take space away from somebody
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
and they completely freak out because
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's there's nothing more
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
traumatic than moving your desk right
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're so we're careful about it
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so generally speaking
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're if you're i'm
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to use examples in the annex the
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture has these
 
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.390 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture has these
rooms

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
in this space
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
and at some point if they start getting
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
positions thrown at them in the budget
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
something might come up and we might
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
have to look at and go you know what
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to have to move
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
abandoned property for the treasury over
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
here and move them here and kind of
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
create a little bit of room for them um
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
but until that happens where there's an
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
issue we kind of let it go we don't we
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't say we wouldn't keep such
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
perfect track of their vacancies to say
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
that you know based on what we're
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
looking at you've got six open positions
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
and you have desk space for them i'm
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
gonna take uh uh human rights commission
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
and move them in on you so we so we try
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
not to do that it's rare it's what's
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
typically the case is that an agency has
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
enough space for the people they have
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
and they may do some internal moving
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
around to make that work somebody who
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
thinks he or she is entitled to an
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
office not that anyone's entitled um is
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
in a cubicle or vice versa sometimes
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's like you know i got an office
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
because nobody was using it
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and sometimes that happens but um
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's sort of moving around we we're
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
doing some work in the annex or
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary work now but eventually
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be chaos
 
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
it'll be chaos
um

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we were moving people around and i
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
had to take for example judicial council
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
you guys see sarah periodically we had
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
to move them somewhere there weren't
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
there were only a few places to move
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
them because we were doing asbestos
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
remediation where they were
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually my office and my assistant's
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
office is where they are now
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm in a supply closet
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a supply closet it's larger
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
than that and there's a window so it's
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
not really but that didn't stop the
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
terry path and the attorney general from
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
mocking me last week from my office but
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly lovely but we did that
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
because all right this works you know
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
this is open and we can put the copier
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
here instead of here and and you know
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's some fire suppression sensors on
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
the wall but you know i wouldn't mind
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
knowing when there was a fire and so you
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
do some of that um to sort of make it
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
out so we we keep regular track and when
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
the budget passes
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know somebody in joe's team does a
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
does a position summary on on where
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
positions were added
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
and we keep track of that
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then we work with the people
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
our plant and property people will work
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
directly with the agency to say you know
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on and what and you know
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they'll know
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
they'll know when the men's room leaks
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
before we do
 
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.069 align:start position:0%
before we do
so

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.829 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll fix that okay thank you i know
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
some of us have done that for a living
 
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.990 align:start position:0%
some of us have done that for a living
anyhow

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
i guess that uh
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
this vacancy rate for new hampshire that
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
was put together by you initially
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um can we add to this
 
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
um can we add to this
temporary

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
positions that so this this sheet that
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm holding up
 
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.190 align:start position:0%
i'm holding up
um

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
oh there's a camera i keep forgetting
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's a camera um is it says full-time
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
classified funded positions at the top
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
and this is class 10 and 59 and i can
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
get you data that breaks it down by the
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
tens and the tens of the full-time
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
permanent 59 i mean you're all the
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
budget people you you're you're actually
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
the people who know this um the uh and
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
the full-time temps and i can break it
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
down by those two and you'll see the one
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
is slightly lower because it's the tens
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
and the 59s are higher in part because
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a long occasionally a long lag
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
after they're created before they're
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
filled okay thank you i i didn't realize
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of us realize that
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
this included both
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yes okay
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
so the reason i know it included both
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
because so
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know that i didn't do this
 
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know that i didn't do this
myself

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
um actually the person who did it is uh
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
carolyn russell working with fdm and i
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
took our department and tried to
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
validate it to i thought all right what
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
do i think our vacancy rate is and i and
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
i went through it and i'm like wait a
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
minute why am i getting a different
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
number and then it's like oh she's
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
including the 59s okay here i am and
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
then once i got there i thought okay
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
this works because it you know i know
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
from hiring that it's actually right
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it's you know technically out of
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
date every time we hire somebody right
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
is it right
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
not much
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay well i thank you so
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
you'll be back
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
next month
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here every month whether you want me
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
to be or not yeah statutorily you're
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
right except you were late today so well
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
i was at ways and means just for the
 
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
i was at ways and means just for the
record

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
i have one more question for you oh
 
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:57.190 align:start position:0%
i have one more question for you oh
sorry

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
ollie thank you mr arlingham
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
so one of the things i couldn't find was
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate for part-time positions
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know i have lists of part-time
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
positions is that something that you try
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
if it wanted to could sort of do a
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
part-time vacancy rate but it's sort of
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
for this reason when you do budgets
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh part-time positions are placed in
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
class 50 and you're not assigning
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
positions so so the so the budget that
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
you do is budgeted by position i mean
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
literally if you go in the background of
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
the system there's a there's a position
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
module and there's a there's a specific
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
number of positions assigned to very
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
specific things and those positions are
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
created in the system so they exist
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
part-time functionally what you do is
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
you say to uh to uh to an accounting
 
00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:48.790 align:start position:0%
you say to uh to uh to an accounting
unit

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
for part-time workers
 
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.430 align:start position:0%
for part-time workers
and

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's a basis for that the agency in
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
developing the budget will do we'll do
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
um sheets in the background to say well
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know fred makes this and tony makes
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
we do it obviously every accounting unit
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
for building service workers who are
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
mostly part-time
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
and there's like you know you know you
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
know beth made 12 grand last year and
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and patty made 14-6 and
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you know kim you go down that list
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
um but technically i could hire two
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
people at six grand instead of one
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
person at 12. okay you're what you're
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing is appropriating money to me to
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
spend on part-time workers as many or as
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
few as i want
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
technically non-classified is the same
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
thing right we cr you created
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions well on the
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
budget they think of the governor's
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
office which is really where the only
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions are or were and
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
will be again
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
you just give him a chunk of money and
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
he can pay anybody whatever he wants
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
because because it's a week because it's
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
a you know it's because it's a political
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
office not a not an administrative
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
office right and so
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
i said to him once that you could this
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
is when i worked there i said you could
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
pay one employee 500 000 if you wanted
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
to not telling you which one it should
 
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
to not telling you which one it should
be

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
but that's technically true right it
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
would be weird but it's true and part
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
time is the same way that there's a
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
part-time money allocated not a position
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
so anything i told you would be vague
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
so when you create
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
when we create these part-time positions
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
how do we ever know if they're
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
getting filled and doing their what
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
um i mean
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
in theory when you're when you're going
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
through and this typically happens right
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
at the at the division level in finance
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
when you're going through the finance
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
process there's a lot of reporting a lot
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
of it you wouldn't necessarily know you
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to know on on the
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
part-time money in particular because i
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think the thought process in the in in
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
the past had always been
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to authorize you to do this
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to authorize you to do it with
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
part-time workers
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
and and the distinction really is that
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're not paying benefits right it's not
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's not really more complicated than
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
that and because of that i'm not really
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
worried that you might be paying
 
00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
worried that you might be paying
somebody

00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
too much money or out of whack because
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're they are going to be created
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
they are going to have an sjd in the
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
system they are going to be part of that
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
so they'll be
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
they'll match the system that way
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i just want to know if you're going
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
to get it done and it'd be too much to
 
00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.230 align:start position:0%
to get it done and it'd be too much to
manage

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
manage
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
so you've agreed to less oversight but
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
you can always ask
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm not worried about the money
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
i mean i know it should be but that's
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
not what i'm talking about i'm sure
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
about the job getting done and these a
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot of these arpa positions are coming
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
well some of these
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
some of these positions in that big
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet are part time maybe the
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
wrong thing but
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we can get back to you
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
periodically on on position counts but
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
but if you think about the vacancy sheet
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have for example
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
17.7 you don't know exactly which
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
position and and which person does it so
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's hard i think any time you
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
know with any project uh you know i
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
think we're in a system where
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
um any commissioner director or state
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
employee would feel like a question from
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal is one they're required to answer
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and that would happen and um
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
i know our sense on our arpa stuff is
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
that is that there will be a not day of
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
reckoning what's the right term for that
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
an accounting that we have to do for it
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
right that we have to come forward and
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
say this happened
 
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
say this happened
and

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know if i have a position
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try like hell to fill it
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's you know i have a i
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
have a i have a
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know 400 people well vacancies so
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
300 and some who are working their tails
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
off and struggling right to get you know
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
i talk to the cleaner on my floor every
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
night and and we have conversations
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
about she hates the cleaning product we
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
buy she thinks it's colored water we
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
need something with acid in it um i know
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
more about cleaning products than i did
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
five years ago but
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
because she's trying really hard to get
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
stuff done and she's like well we don't
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
do that anymore on wednesdays because i
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't have time
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
and so if i got a position
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know there's nobody in state
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
government who doesn't want to fill it
 
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.750 align:start position:0%
government who doesn't want to fill it
period

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and we will
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
look forward to
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from you in april as will i
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i really really appreciate it because
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that obviously
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
concerns all of us that we are approving
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
so many
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
temporary positions
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
to do specific work
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we have no clue
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not it's
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting done so we're we're from my just
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
so you know from our standpoint we're
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
very eager about this too this is this
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
is an area where i i think and and i
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
speak for everybody probably in hr in
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
the state but um we think we can really
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
make a difference in helping people it's
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
a it's a struggle for everybody probably
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's a struggle for every business in
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
the state right right now but it's a
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
struggle for everybody and and
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know the pitch pitching arp on us
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
was to try to help people and it's and
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
we and you know the thought was you know
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
where can we make a difference for
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
agencies and you know nobody sitting
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
behind me is going to
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
raise his or her hand if i say raise
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
your hand if you found it easy to hire
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
so so we're very optimistic that
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
good things will happen
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason that i asked commissioner
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus to come up is because
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
although we have uh basically approved
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
already 22 104 for the department of
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
justice they are looking to hire
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
a temporary full-time position
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
we have a better understanding hopefully
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
of uh of what's going on out there
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
and um you know don't be surprised over
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
the next several months if we don't
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
continue to ask questions about
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates
 
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates
okay

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.070 align:start position:0%
uh the next item is um
 
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.829 align:start position:0%
uh the next item is um
[Music]

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:31.030 align:start position:0%

thanks
uh

00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um i think this
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
an easy one on
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the first paragraph on
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
the second page
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
it says uh that the activity supported
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
under this award will include and here's
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
the key word continued
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
development of streamlined approaches
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
for the clutch blah blah blah blah so my
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
question there is
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds like some streamlining has
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
already taken place and we're going to
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
continue to streamline
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
can you tell us
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know how much more efficient has
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
this first year made us and and what do
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
we think the potential for streamlining
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
is in the second year
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
sure good morning uh for the record i'm
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
ian what i'm the deputy director for the
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
division of public health services um
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at our processes
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're obviously always trying to be more
 
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
we're obviously always trying to be more
efficient

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
in both accepting information with our
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
internal systems and how we aggregate
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
the volume of data that we've received
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know throughout the pandemic has
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
obviously exceeded anything that we have
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
historically had to take on so
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to specific tactics we'll
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
be taking uh moving forward but we are
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
always looking at how we utilize staff
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
how we utilize systems and how we accept
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
information you heard earlier from from
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education that our
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
the information we're getting is
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
evolving how both how much and the exact
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
data that we're receiving and so we'll
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
continue to look at as we receive data
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
reports how we accept them and how we
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
use that data for our public dashboards
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
and some of that de-identified data that
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
so so i pulled that out because it just
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
seems like it's an inherently hard thing
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
to have performance metrics around
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
how much development have we done how
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
much more do we have to do it's kind of
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
hard to say so i'm just i'm just
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
curious if if how you're monitoring or
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
measuring it so you feel like you're
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
being successful in this area yeah so
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know we receive both case reports i
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
mean this uh item specifically refers to
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
travelers health
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking more broadly when i
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
speak to data we receive case reports on
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
a daily basis through various forms and
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know our intent is to get through
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
that data aggregated and produce public
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
information as quickly as possible
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
we have at various times the pandemic
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know had varying success just given
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases that have come in so
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know our expectation going forward
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
given the uh
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know lessening of cases in the
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
community would be that we will be able
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
to continue to meet that
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
kind of semi-regular deadline either
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
daily or or semi-daily to be able to
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
report a full case count and completed
 
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.150 align:start position:0%
report a full case count and completed
reports

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have a clock on ourselves in
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
terms of an exact timeline to report
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
that data we try to be as efficient
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
efficient as possible with the staff
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
obviously relative to the case counts
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
as i was reading the department's
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
set of materials here one trend that
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
and i don't know miss rounds if you're
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for this but i really
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i think you all are
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
anticipating the kinds of questions
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask and so i i just think
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
in this document and the subsequent ones
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
i i just appreciate that you guys are
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
putting in the extra work to be clear on
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
on what what you're doing so so thank
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome and the credit for
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
that definitely goes to the program
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
okay i i have one question unless
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
someone else has a question
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay yes go ahead please senator daniels
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you could you get clarification uh
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
under the requested action and they have
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
the word mandated
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
when it says protecting the health of
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
travelers and communities and global
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
mobile world project
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
as mandated
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
is it i i'd like to understand how the
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
is it i i'd like to understand how the
word

00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
is used is that saying that arpa is
 
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.910 align:start position:0%
is used is that saying that arpa is
mandating

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to have this program or or
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
is it saying that you know that there's
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
a program and that
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's something within oppa that's
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
that tells
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
used if it's accepted right
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you for the question so
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
this is a language that we've used and
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
has been used throughout the pandemic
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
with funds accepted through arpa so
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
should we accept this funding and
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
activate this program we're mandated to
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
utilize it for the intentions of the
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
program as outlined in the rescue plan
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
act so you know we're not mandated to
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
activate the program we're certainly
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
mandated to use the money as intended by
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
the federal law thank you
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
we also had a discussion in
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
our group
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
as we understand it you go out and apply
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
for the money
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
and then they either agree or disagree
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so really what we're doing is
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
we are required to spend the money
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
for what
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
you have asked for
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
or what they have
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
sent or whatever
 
00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
sent or whatever
so

00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that it is
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the mandating is for the fact that
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
you got the money and you're spending it
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
and to me mandating means they told you
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
you had to go and get it
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
which is not the way i understand the
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
program work so
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i would prefer a
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
different word like required
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
and not because it's not man you know
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
the only reason it's mandated is because
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
you went and asked for the money and you
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
have to spend it so
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know you don't they don't
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
when you come in for other
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
non-arpa money i don't think you use the
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
term mandated
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
you know you
so

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
if we can certainly make that adjustment
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know if that's if that's okay you
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
know it
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
just it's one of those things that
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes get people's hair on the back
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
of their neck up
 
01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:21.190 align:start position:0%
of their neck up
okay

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
are they oh yes i do have one
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
question on
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
not that it's a huge amount of money
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
but it says you're going to purchase the
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
canvas software
 
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
canvas software
and

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:36.810 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.670 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
since this is all
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.270 align:start position:0%
since this is all
contract

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand why
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
the department needed to purchase
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
the canvas software yeah so the staff
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
member identified in this item
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know may have the need to develop
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of quick graphics for our
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
social media accounts or reporting or
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
other kind of public information and the
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
canva account which i believe is about
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
120 annual license will allow them to do
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
that on demand without
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
consulting so this is not necessarily
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
just for this program is that correct
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're just financing it up out of this
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
program i hope well we would certainly
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
utilize it for traveler health
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
information that we disseminate over
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
social media and otherwise um
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be extensible i mean
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
the license isn't limited to just this
 
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
the license isn't limited to just this
work

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.150 align:start position:0%
work
okay

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
man i'm sure ma'am move to um that we
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 22-088
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right do i have a second
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
by the way maybe i'll come over and
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to use your canvas software it
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
sounds interesting please do
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh i just said please oh please do okay
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%

okay now we turn to
 
01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.549 align:start position:0%
okay now we turn to
fis-22099

01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
did you give me permission not yet
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
you have a senator edward
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards you
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you madam chair
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
and this this is sort of similar to the
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the mandate question are we using the
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
right term
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad we had that conversation
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
because this was the first time i noted
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
it on this
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
but on the on the second page
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's another word here that i i think
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
may be improperly used in the context
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
and that's the word infrastructure
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
it says on the second sentence towards
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
the end it says we're going to build and
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
maintain infa
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
infection prevention
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure necessary necessary to
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
support law
 
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.390 align:start position:0%
support law
so

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
to me the word infrastructure means
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to buy something that's
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
going to be persistent and everything i
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
read in this makes us feel like it's
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
just temporary or transitory and it
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
is we're going to get a temporary
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
capacity perhaps but i i the word
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure jumps out can you can you
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
talk to that yeah so so in addition you
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
know i think you make a good point
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly the resources in terms of
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
people would be kind of transitory or
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
temporary public health education we
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
consider a fairly durable good and part
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
of you know the fabric of public health
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the community and in these facilities
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of infection control management
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
information around covid19 and other
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
transmissible diseases so you know we
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
consider that an infrastructure
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
investment in these facilities that they
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
would get on a long-term basis but you
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
know certainly point taken about kind of
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
the physical assets and and commitment
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes uh
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
budgeteers fall into
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
using words that's being funded
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
currently and infrastructure is a good
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
hot word to fund but if we could be
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
precise there that'd be better for me
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
but um all right so
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
it says in the second paragraph that
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're monitoring the indicators and so
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
if i were to ask i'm not asking but if i
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
were to ask for a list of the indicators
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
that you that you monitor could you
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
produce such a list
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so in you know putting forth a
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
similar program over the course of the
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
the omicron search and what we saw this
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
past winter you know we monitor a number
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
of patients you know patient throughput
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
and the ability to care for individuals
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
how many people we can get out of
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals efficiently to ensure the
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
health care system is functioning so we
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
would have information like that
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
regarding what
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
this investment helped facilitate within
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
this investment helped facilitate within
these

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
these facilities and then you know in
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
turn how they help the health care
 
01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:35.589 align:start position:0%
turn how they help the health care
system

01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the answers and
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
will you be able to include the veterans
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
home in this
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
if in this
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
capacity building work
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
public health so i actually don't have
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
that answer offhand
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
we have worked with both county
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and private facilities and
 
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
facilities and private facilities and
others

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
i don't have in front of me and i don't
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge in my head
 
01:06:03.039 --> 01:06:05.589 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge in my head
unfortunately

01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay could you please get that back to
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
us absolutely okay more than happy yeah
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you just send it if you would to
 
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
thank you just send it if you would to
uh

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
lba and they'll get it out because i
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
think that's a it's an extremely
 
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.750 align:start position:0%
think that's a it's an extremely
important

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.470 align:start position:0%
important
uh

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
area

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
is there anything any
 
01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
is there anything any
uh

01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
i have some sort of broad
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
questions about the effectiveness of
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the program
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
some some nursing homes didn't
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
choose to participate the reason being
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a fear that they get these
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
patients in
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
out of the hospitals with the strike
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
team then the strike team leaves and
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
then they still have the patience
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious as to how many nursing
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
homes participate in both county i mean
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
broken up county and private
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
and how cost effective has the program
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
been in terms of actually
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
getting patients out of the hospital
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
into nursing homes and then being able
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide service the
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
nursing's homes continue to be able to
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to provide services
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
those folks once the strike teams are
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
gone because i believe this is the
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
second or third
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
go around to this type of program
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
so i did uh receive your questions
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
uh
questions

01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
i had a question i just need to get my
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh piece of paper out
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
you can come back to me if you're
 
01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
you can come back to me if you're
willing

01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
willing
 
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
willing
okay

01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
so few questions um
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
this runs through 2026 but i guess the
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
funding is only through this biennium
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
the the four million dollars or whatever
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of curious is this going to be
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
a long term we're going to have this
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
huge space not going into the future or
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
is this kind of a temporary thing is
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
codeword related it seems like
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
like a lot of money for a big space
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
so we have thank you for the question so
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know at this point a lot of durable
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
items ppe testing equipment durable
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
medical goods like ventilators
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
ventilator equipment on hand and we have
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
that on hand you know anticipating what
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen this past winter you know we
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
obviously don't know what the the future
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
holds in terms of covet 19 we are in a
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
very in a good place right now in terms
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
of case counts we do anticipate case
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
counts will increase in the future we
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
don't know to what level we don't know
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
on what frequency so you know the idea
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the stockpile of goods and this
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
warehouse is to have us have supplies on
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
hand that allow us to endure the same
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
breaks in the supply chain that we've
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
seen over the past two years obviously
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
in 2020 you know we're in a position
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
where we weren't able to get almost
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
anything we were getting kind of single
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
goods one at a time this winter we saw
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the same you know challenges related to
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
gloves related to n95 masks so the
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
intent is to make sure that we can
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
continue to provide a continuity of
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
services to healthcare facilities to
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
schools to correctional facilities and
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
others you know to make sure that we
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to operate life as
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
normal here in new hampshire in terms of
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know long term past the five years
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
our intent would actually be to be
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating the space on an annual basis
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's included in the lease
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate we would not have any
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
space before the end of five years and i
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
can't project you know past five years
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
obviously not anticipating where we'll
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
be with coven 19 or any other challenges
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
we may endure between now and then
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly it's a continuous
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation on our part of what is
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to you know to react to and be
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
prepared for
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
for future events
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
i have my paper now representative
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
edwards uh
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:12.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i had the same question um
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
about the long-term nature of the space
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
and and and it's a it's
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
all together
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
about 3.9 million dollars which just
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
feels like a lot of money for two street
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
addresses uh for a year um and so
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm guessing that because this
 
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm guessing that because this
was

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
an urgent need
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
we we didn't go out for bid
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i i'd like you to confirm that and
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
could you tell us who the
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the property owner is for this this
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
piece of property
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
i assume it's one owner because it's 19
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
and 23 terrell park drive in concord so
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you having been at the
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
emergency operations center when we
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
first procured uh
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
this space is that we did look at
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
several different spaces at the time
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're correct that it didn't go out to
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
bid because it was an emergency at that
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
point we had ppe coming in and needed a
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
place to put it um
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that the price was
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
competitive i don't have the name of the
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
owner but i'd be happy to get you that
 
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
owner but i'd be happy to get you that
information

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
i i i'd appreciate it and and also if
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
you could give me some idea what the
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
ballpark is on the cost per square foot
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
for the rental sure is i i i i have no
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
clue how big these facilities are but
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
that just seems like a lot of money for
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
a year lease
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes we can get you that information okay
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
are there any uh rep senator rosenwald
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
so if you're
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
gonna keep this space through the next
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
budget are you gonna be looking for
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
for the next budget
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh potentially so that's something as
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
ian mentioned we'll be evaluating each
 
01:12:56.719 --> 01:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
ian mentioned we'll be evaluating each
year

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the letter said by may first
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
of each year so that does allow us to
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
adjust the budget in the senate phase if
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
we needed to
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
based on what we would need going
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
forward but i expect over the next six
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
months we'll also have a better sense
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
whether we see
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
continued surges and and what they look
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
like and like ian said what the needs of
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
the based on the supply chain are so i'm
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm confident that before we're
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
closing on a budget we'll have a pretty
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
good sense what is needed
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
so you're storing ventilators there that
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
the state owns
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
or do
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
the hospitals own the ventilators and
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
you're just storing them
 
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
you're just storing them
so

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
we have a variety of goods there so
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020 obviously getting ventilators
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
was extremely difficult and the federal
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
government out of the strategic national
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
stockpile distributed ventilators to the
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
states so we accepted
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
that equipment on behalf of new
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire and then
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
distributed to facilities for their
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
needs we have seen because you know some
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
ventilators and some ventilator parts
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
are not renewable uh they need
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
replacement or they need to be used you
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
know one one offs
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
per patient excuse me um
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
we have additional equipment all of
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
which actually was distributed during uh
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
this past winter surge some of that
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
equipment the hospitals may maintain for
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing needs you know based on the
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
demand that they've seen some of it will
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
take back and store again for
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
distribution should it be needed in the
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
future thank you thank you
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
if oh yes senator daniels
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you karen did i hear you say that
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
it was expected in the next budget that
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
you would be asking for
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
for money for the storage potentially we
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
would of course always first look to any
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we might have
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
available to continue to pay for it um
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
as you know we haven't even started the
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
agency phase of the budget yet so it's
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
not something that i've you know sat
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
down and talked with anyone about but it
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's something we'll need to evaluate
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up yes uh so how do you
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
reconcile your your answer with the
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
statement that in the event these
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds become no longer available
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
general funds will not be requested to
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
support the program
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
so this request is only through the end
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
of this biennium so that is true for
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
this biennium
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the contract when it
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
goes to gnc that contract would look
 
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
goes to gnc that contract would look
differently

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
but with regards to this request for the
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
funding for the next for this biennium
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
we would not request general funds
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
so for clarification that statement then
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
only pertains to this biennium
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
not the total amount of time that the
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds are available
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
crick because you are approving the
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
financial you are approving us spending
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
these federal funds which we are saying
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
we will not replace with general funds
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
you're not approving the contract
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
we just provided information on what we
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate the contract looking like
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
and and it does say in here uh senator
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
daniels that
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
through december
 
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.990 align:start position:0%
through december
2026

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
2026
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
near the bottom of page two
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
because that's when the arpa money runs
 
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
because that's when the arpa money runs
out

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.669 align:start position:0%
i think
so

01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
adam chair that's what i was talking
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
about but that's why i'm a little bit
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
confused because what i'm what i'm
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
that that uh no general funds will be
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
requested is only for this biennium
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
right but you're you're talking about a
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
date that is out in 26 and
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i'm just kind of curious
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
as to to what happens when
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know this one-time money drops off
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
and we've still got loads of stuff
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's stored
 
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
that's stored
uh

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
how was you know what are we going to do
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
with it how is it going to be paid for
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
things like that if you're not asking
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
for general funds yes and we we out as
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
ian mentioned we absolutely plan on
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
evaluating this annually and if we did
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
need to reduce
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
what is being kept to reduce the space
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
that would require an entire plan which
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
we would have
uh

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
anyone else
yes

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
represent edwards i just want to um
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
say to you and you probably look at it
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
the same way i look at four million
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
as being more than half of what we would
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
want to spend on an adult dental
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid program and so
 
01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:26.149 align:start position:0%
medicaid program and so
buying

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
buying
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
renting space
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
and taking and doing direct health care
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
i i just want to keep our priorities
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
straight that we minimize
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know our investment and logistics
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
particularly when we're just renting
 
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.030 align:start position:0%
particularly when we're just renting
renters

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
renters
 
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
renters
understood

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.350 align:start position:0%
understood
okay

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions okay i
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
i know you mentioned the what's it
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
called the federal strategic reserve
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called it's the strategic
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
strategic national stockpile okay thank
 
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.149 align:start position:0%
strategic national stockpile okay thank
you

01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
does the state have a requirement to
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
have a strategic stockpile so
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the strategic national stockpile
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually the it's part of a federal
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
program that requires us to be a conduit
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
should there be
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know a major biological event or
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
other event that requires us to
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
distribute certain supplies we have
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
other facilities around the state
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
pre-identified where we'd be able to
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
stage and actually distribute to people
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
in need of you know whatever it may be
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
medication or otherwise so we have a
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
space and this is something that
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
predates the pandemic as well we have a
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
requirement to have space available to
 
01:18:35.199 --> 01:18:36.390 align:start position:0%
requirement to have space available to
accept

01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
that shipment so we don't actually have
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
to have anything on hand we just have to
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
be able to accept it from the national
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
program yeah the strategic national
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
stockpile does not obligate the state to
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
hold the stockpile okay but it does
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
obligate us to have a distribution
 
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.350 align:start position:0%
obligate us to have a distribution
center

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
it obligates us to have the ability to
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
accept uh accept goods to be able to
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
distribute them okay
 
01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
distribute them okay
now

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
you may or may not know that i spent 28
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
years in
 
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.669 align:start position:0%
years in
logistics

01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
logistics
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so this is
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
a logistics question
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
what is your what are your inventory
 
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.830 align:start position:0%
what is your what are your inventory
procedures

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
and your in and outs
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
and replacement do you have a system or
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
are we just
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
doing something i don't know what
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a very good question thank you
 
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't want i don't want to say that
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
because i know as a logistician i never
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
did anything haphazardly so we we have
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know obviously the the pandemic
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
required us to stand up this capability
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
to a scale that we had not previously
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
executed in dhhs we used an existing
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
system called juvari um to manage our
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
inventory uh we have a full-time
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
logistics coordinator who has been a
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of our staff i believe the position
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
has been funded for about a decade
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that person is responsible for
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining that inventory they have
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
three contract staff currently
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
supporting them in terms of your point
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
about ins and outs you know
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
it is a question top of mind for us as
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
well in terms of turnover of the
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
equipment you know some of the equipment
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
does have expiration dates and we're
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
actively looking at those questions now
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
partnering with the hospitals you know
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
turning over equipment to them for their
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
use so that we don't have stale
 
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
use so that we don't have stale
equipment

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes so all the questions are certainly
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
in mind and we're actively pursuing them
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
because i certainly don't want to end up
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the situation that we did when
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
the first part you know covet
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic where the stuff that was in the
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
strategic stockpile was outdated broken
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
whatever else
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to add to that we also
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
have to provide an annual inventory for
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
the act for formerly known as the kafir
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the department of administrative
 
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.270 align:start position:0%
to the department of administrative
services

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
can we do that as well you had a
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
question yes yes one additional question
 
01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.750 align:start position:0%
question yes yes one additional question
please

01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
i know that we have state buildings that
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
are vacant why can we not use those
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
buildings as opposed to
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
charlie

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have state buildings that are
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the state space that is habitable is all
 
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.790 align:start position:0%
the state space that is habitable is all
habited

01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
habited
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are some buildings on the campus
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
for example that are relatively vacant
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
think of kent that's attached to the
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
back of main building but to give you an
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
idea of what kind of building it is when
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
i walked through it
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
when i started first became commissioner
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the direction was don't look where
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're walking look at the floor because
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
you don't want to step on the holes and
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
and be careful before you take a step to
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
make sure it looks like it um it looks
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
like it'll hold
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the piles that look like bird
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
droppings and raccoon droppings are
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
so that building is vacant it's not
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
suitable for stockpiling medical
 
01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
suitable for stockpiling medical
equipment

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are there's a there's a thought
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
people have about how we have lots of
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
lots of empty and vacant buildings
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
the state has since since representative
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
calaba was on from litchfield was on the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the committee in the late 90s has
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
been aggressively looking at
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
redoing buildings for example that
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
campus there's nothing vacant anymore
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's structurally sound there
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
are some buildings are in the process of
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
being converted bancroft is the only
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
real example of this
 
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.669 align:start position:0%
real example of this
where

01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's not suitable for a for a
 
01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's not suitable for a for a
warehouse

01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
warehouse
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have warehouse space what we
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
typically do is is we convert anything
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
we have that somebody can go in we stick
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in because we're currently
 
01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
somebody in because we're currently
renting

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to this number but
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
something like 250 000 square feet of
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
office space
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
around the city of concord so there so
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
there aren't really
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
vacant spots that anything could go in
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
when the during the pandemic i know i
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't know any of the details on this
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
because i i have very smart people who
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
worked on it and i don't know any of the
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
details but um
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
worked with hhs on finding warehouse
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
space and and we didn't have any of our
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
own we just didn't
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
like i i literally can't think of a big
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
room somewhere that we could stick stuff
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
no i was just questioning and bancroft
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
came to mind because we were out looking
 
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
came to mind because we were out looking
at

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
space when we talked about the
 
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
space when we talked about the
psychiatric

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
hospital and
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
other things uh we got it regarding
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
mental health and i knew it wasn't being
 
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
mental health and i knew it wasn't being
used

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not sure if it's uh
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
if it if it's not you say that it's not
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate i'm not sure
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
why it may be that it needs renovation
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
to it and then there's a question is
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
well should we maybe take the money that
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would be spending
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
on renting and put that into renovating
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
a building so that we've got something
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
that we can use
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
for something else when we're done using
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
it as a warehouse so i'm just just
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the other options and
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i think i think that's actually not
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
a not a bad thing to do at some point
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
look at that i it's it's a longer term
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
rather than shorter term that is to say
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
probably won't solve
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
needs in the first year or two but um
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
just at bancroft for an update because i
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of interest in
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
bancroft because of the nature of that
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
building and and people who have been
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
to it and i don't know anybody's been in
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
it recently but
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
the last capital bud budget item secured
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
it from the weather right in a in a
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
building's lifespan it reaches a point
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
building's lifespan it reaches a point
where

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you stop working on it it's going to
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
become like laconia let's say where the
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
question is how you tear it down not if
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
policymakers made a decision three years
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
ago to decide that we probably don't
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to tear it down so we fixed the
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
roof and we fixed a lot of the you know
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
things like caulking so that when you're
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know when i toured bancroft the
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
first time it was a rainstorm and and
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
the guys who were showing it to me
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
i remember doug burnham in particular
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
he had a he had a notebook with him and
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
he was excited because he uh aside from
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
knowing where all the ghosts are he now
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
knew where all the leaks were because it
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
was raining and he's like okay there's
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
one there and there's one there hang on
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
just say let me finish this let me
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
finish writing in the leaks before we
 
01:25:12.719 --> 01:25:13.590 align:start position:0%
finish writing in the leaks before we
talk

01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and uh so we'll fix that but in terms of
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
like let's say you wanted to put a
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facility in there lots and
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
lots of millions of dollars to turn it
 
01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.470 align:start position:0%
lots of millions of dollars to turn it
from

01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know because there's you know
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's lead paint and there are
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
some holes but it's externally protected
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
to keep it from falling apart
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank thank you i i sort of was thinking
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
about senator daniel's question
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think i read
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
that it's the intent of the governor
 
01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
that it's the intent of the governor
to

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
to
destroy

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
destroy
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
um plow under
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the sununu youth development center
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
when it gets emptied and and and that's
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
just a lot of building there that seems
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
to have uh repurposed potential
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
are we going to actually do a business
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
case analysis
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we can repurpose that
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
building versus just destroying it
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
can we get that information back to you
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
the uh director of dcyf isn't here today
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i think he would
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
like to be part of that conversation
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to tear it
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay could i have uh are there any other
 
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.390 align:start position:0%
okay could i have uh are there any other
questions

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
all right could i have a motion please
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
oh i'm i'm sorry senator guida i didn't
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
see you thank you madam chair just based
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
on the last set of comments
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to do a uh
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
a tabling
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
until we can find out whether sununu
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
might be usable
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
i've toured that building it's in pretty
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
good shape
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
for the most part the parts that have
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
are not being used and i'm wondering it
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
would cause any harm if we were to table
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
this until we got
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
dcyf's answer and perhaps coordinating
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
with charlie
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand that
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative edward's question was
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
could we use that space for warehouse
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
space right um i didn't was that
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
that was what you were implying i i was
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
more generic in repurposing the building
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
because it's got specialty spaces that
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
might be good suitable for a similar use
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
right i i although the square footage is
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know significant in some areas of
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
that building i don't believe it would
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
be conducive to storing equipment there
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
aren't um elevators that go to the
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
second floors of some of those areas
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
there are many you know small rooms um i
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that would make sense
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
as a warehouse space
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think you're going to get a
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
different answer from anyone else at the
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
department but
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you want me to
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
in writing i can certainly do that my
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
question is if my question is more than
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee do you think it
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.030 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
okay

01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
if you want my answer it's no
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a motion to approve
 
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.390 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a motion to approve

01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
gonna spend 23 million dollars
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
in a lump sum not specified so my
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
first question is do you have any kind
 
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.350 align:start position:0%
first question is do you have any kind
of

01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
plan you could share with us
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
and my second question is
 
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
and my second question is
does

01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
this obligate
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
any state program in any way that's
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to be a budget expense
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we should be thinking about the
 
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
that we should be thinking about the
ongoing

01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
operational cost or contract cost
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
um well to answer your question this
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
request today is the accept and expense
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can excuse me would you
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
identify yourself um i'm sorry taylor
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
caswell okay executive director of
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
gopher um no thank you
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is the accept and expense that we
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
can continue to work with easter seals
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
on the
final

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of this plan
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
but in concept this is a a project that
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
will be sort of the crown jewel of
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
veterans services and housing available
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
on a single site 15 acres and frank
 
01:31:16.639 --> 01:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
on a single site 15 acres and frank
franklin

01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
that the easter seals does currently
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
already own
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to the competitively bid
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
component to this
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
this site is ideal in every way for this
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
type of a project
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
any funding that ultimately makes its
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
way into a contract which would have to
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
be approved prior to any of this
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
actually being spent on this project
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
would still have to comply with all of
 
01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:40.950 align:start position:0%
would still have to comply with all of
the

01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
federal procurement
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
rules federal environmental rules and so
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
on that are applicable under the
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
could i follow up please thank you
 
01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.229 align:start position:0%
could i follow up please thank you
but

01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
these are essentially state funds
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
um because we're accepting them
 
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.510 align:start position:0%
um because we're accepting them
so

01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
what is the state's oversight
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to be on this project
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
and and then there was the second part
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
of my question
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay so this i mean my the way that this
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
would work is that these are federal
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that we would accept and
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
spend be available for us to continue uh
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
to to work with easter seals to make the
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
final designs on this project which
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
would ultimately come up with a contract
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
in which all of those issues would be
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
addressed prior to any money being spent
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
and i would say that this is designed to
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
be funding exclusively for
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
the development and construction of this
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
project and would not be used basically
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
because due to the simple fact that we
 
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
because due to the simple fact that we
can't

01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
obligate funds beyond 24 and spend
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
beyond 26 that this would all have to be
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
done within that time frame so it does
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
not envision in this particular
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
component of the funding the operational
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
costs that would go with this and those
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be exclusively on easter seals
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the operation of that project just
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
as they do you know a lot of other
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
projects around the state
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
in choosing the the property in which to
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
put this
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
camp how do you go about competing with
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
other projects the state has going on
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
for instance relocation of sununu center
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that there was
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
an analysis that compared it to that
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
particular site i think this is
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
a situation where we have an owner that
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
um has
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we are well familiar with that has
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
done housing development and services
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
for uh for for different types of
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
populations in the state that owns a
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
site that meets a lot of the criteria
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
that you would look for in a site like
 
01:33:57.199 --> 01:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
that you would look for in a site like
this

01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned this would be
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
a project that ultimately would fall
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
under all of the federal competitive bid
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
process for the actual construction of
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
this project uh should we get to that
 
01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.110 align:start position:0%
this project uh should we get to that
point

01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
if i could so
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
what what you're saying is that the
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the 23 million
 
01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.910 align:start position:0%
the 23 million
will

01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
be spent on the facility
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
but not until
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
a contract is approved by gnc correct
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay so you're just getting the money
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
up front
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that you can
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
do something with the contract is that
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
correct well yeah i mean it makes it a
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
lot easier for easter seals to make
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
commitments of their time and energy and
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
resources if they know that the funding
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
is available for the completion of the
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
project if it actually you know comes to
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative edward you had a
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm at the item thank you and thank you
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
again for taking my questions
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
you want to hire these three
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
positions to work with the existing
 
01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.870 align:start position:0%
positions to work with the existing
housing

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
agencies like new hampshire housing
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering first if your intention is
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
use all of the
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
housing money to provide workforce
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
housing and
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
would that be within the statutory
 
01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
would that be within the statutory
framework

01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
framework
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the state has
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
prod the programs that
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think the governor referred to
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
in his state of the state address the
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar intention on that the
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
details of those programs
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
are still being worked out and in fact i
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
think some of what we're trying to
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
achieve is to bring in
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to be ultimately
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for potentially running that
 
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
responsible for potentially running that
program

01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
to assist in the final version of all of
 
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
to assist in the final version of all of
that

01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's very much the stated
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
intention of the governor to have this
 
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
intention of the governor to have this
funding

01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
be focused in the middle income category
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are many different sort of
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
linguistic gymnastics that people
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
perform when it comes to affordable
 
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:01.109 align:start position:0%
perform when it comes to affordable
housing

01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i think our goal with this will be
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
to accelerate
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
and make more efficient the process of
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
moving as many units as we can with this
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
with this funding uh the bulk of which
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
we would uh we would want to see be in
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
that middle income category
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
could ask a follow-up thank you and that
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
leads to my next question of
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
does bea is it your understanding
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the treasury rule allows
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
that funding to be used for affordable
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
housing and not only market rate housing
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am we would we would be
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
qualifying this program most likely
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
under the revenue replacement categories
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh which would allow us to be able to
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
have some level of flexibility in
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
getting the funding into those types of
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
projects thank you
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion please
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
move to approve
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
seconded by senator rosenwald and good
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
luck finding those three people yeah
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i know and uh you were another
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus was here because
 
01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:20.709 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus was here because
i'm

01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm very very concerned about
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
all of these positions that were
 
01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.030 align:start position:0%
all of these positions that were
approving

01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
approving
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
month after month after month
 
01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:30.070 align:start position:0%
month after month after month
so

01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.149 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%

fis22117

01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
fis22117
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
we approved
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
fis22103 on consent
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh i i had a couple of questions if i if
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
i could ask them even though it doesn't
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh is this something you personally want
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
to know or is it something the committee
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
needs to know
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak for the committee i
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
think it's it's relevant to this program
 
01:40:30.639 --> 01:40:32.870 align:start position:0%
think it's it's relevant to this program
though

01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right one question
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
so 103 is essentially a a program that
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
enhances our uh std
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring and remediation
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's associated with the
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
fact that because of covid
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
it implies there's been a surge and so
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
do we do we know what the correlation
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
between stds and covid
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
is because it i i would think it the
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
opposite has happened stds have gone
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
down in social isolation
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be best to get you
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
that information where um
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
the most the public health folks have
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
left unless you have that
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for the record and landry
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner at dhhs thank you
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
so much for your question i would agree
 
01:41:26.719 --> 01:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
so much for your question i would agree
with

01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
karen that we can provide that
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
information in more detail i know
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on right now to
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
update some of our information that's
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
come in on on std rates
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
but just tangentially there are some
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
that have increased but then as you
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
predicted some took a dip in 2020
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
because people weren't seeking care
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic during you know
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
the stay at home and and that piece so
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
now that some of those numbers are
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
starting to rise as well but as you know
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
director tilly has all that information
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
inside and out
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
and she'd be happy to provide a detail
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
if we if we can send that to you in
 
01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.629 align:start position:0%
if we if we can send that to you in
writing

01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
well well thank you for that i
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
i just uh what my concern there is is
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
that um we're staffing up for what may
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
be a period of decline in stds and then
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
with the covet gone we may expect std
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
rates to go up and then these positions
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
are going away so it just seems like our
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
workload and manpower capacity may be
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
out of sync here
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
so again thank you that
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
completely understand your point so
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
again with these funds as as director
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
tilly has explained i think before the
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
the disease investigation that's
 
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
the disease investigation that's
traditionally

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
done by
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
those investigating stds is the same
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
practice that was needed by cobia 19. so
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of these funds are allow us to
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
flex up and down so we can continue our
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
traditional work around stds and then
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
as covid variants come in or
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
come in and out as we see happening you
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
know throughout the last two years and
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
as the papers are reporting now this
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
will give us the flexibility to step up
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
and down as needed but it won't take
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
away from our traditional work around
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%

okay thank you
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
um can we expect that
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
these salary increases will be
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
have to be made permanent
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and will be rolled into the next budget
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
will it be really temporary thank you
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
for that question senator rosenwald
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
this request is is quite unique as i'm
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
sure all of the committee members see
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that it is so
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
unique is the recent formation of a
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
union at the public defender office
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
and we really have just started that
 
01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:32.149 align:start position:0%
and we really have just started that
process

01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is no agreement in effect
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations have not even begun so our
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
next request for the upcoming biennium
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
is going to depend on those union
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations so it is certainly possible
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
that what will be included in our
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
request but at this point we just can't
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes senator daniels thank you for
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
so for clarification we're using
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
one-time money
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
but your answer is you're not sure if
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to be for ongoing expenses or
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
not thank you senator daniels that is
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
exactly correct okay thank you
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
i just have one quick statement that
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think everyone knows the public
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
defenders are in
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
very bad shape
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
not physically but fiscally
 
01:47:28.639 --> 01:47:30.629 align:start position:0%
not physically but fiscally
and

01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:30.639 --> 01:47:32.629 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:32.639 --> 01:47:33.669 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
this is extremely important to try to
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
keep the public defenders we have and
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to hire some new
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
people so thank you madam chair and i

okay thank you i think there are only
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.719 --> 01:50:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
the next item
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
that i do have a question on is the
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:51:11.199 --> 01:51:12.790 align:start position:0%
this is um
preventing

01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
childhood lead
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
poisoning and paint from
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
water quarterly report blah blah blah
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
i read the report
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
and my only concern is that it doesn't
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
appear that all schools are cooperating
 
01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.510 align:start position:0%
appear that all schools are cooperating
in

01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
this testing
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i just want to know
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
a why
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
and b what are you doing to fix it
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
sure so for the record my name is amy
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
clark and i'm with the department of
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
education in school facilities and i
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
brought along with brandon kernan hi and
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator of the drinking
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
water groundwater bureau at the
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
great okay so we work we work
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together on this item
 
01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.669 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together on this item
obviously

01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:51:57.679 --> 01:51:58.950 align:start position:0%
obviously
and

01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
the report those it looks like
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
non-compliance perhaps but it was the
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
results of the testing that i think that
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking at so um
 
01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.229 align:start position:0%
you're looking at so um
on

01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
that table in appendix a
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind the standard is at 15
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
parts per billion which requires schools
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
to remediate for lead and these are the
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
results of those samples so what is what
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's saying is 36 percent of the schools
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
tested exceeded the limits but then they
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
were required to remediate
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
um and so we actually have almost 93 of
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
our schools reporting those results to
 
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:40.229 align:start position:0%
our schools reporting those results to
us

01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i got that okay but
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
what about the seven percent that aren't
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
reporting and what are you doing to fix
 
01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:50.470 align:start position:0%
reporting and what are you doing to fix
that

01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
sure there's a lot of work ongoing right
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
now to improve the management of this
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
program essentially there was a law
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 that required these
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
schools to sample without a system in
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
place and without a budget in place at
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
the time we since received epa grants
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial grants
 
01:53:06.719 --> 01:53:07.589 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial grants
and

01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
developed work plans that involved
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
hiring a contractor to administer in
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
outreach to the schools and also a
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
temporary part-time position
 
01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
temporary part-time position
unfortunately

01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
right when those got approved covet
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
occurred and there was sort of a freeze
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
on new contracts and also hiring new
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
staff until people kind of figured out
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
the consequences of of covid
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
since that time we have hired
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
the person who's now developed the rfp
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've hired a contractor and they are
 
01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
we've hired a contractor and they are
now

01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know proactively outreaching to
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
these schools letting them know about
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirements to sample and
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
to mitigate if there's exceedances
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
and so that works on going there's a
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
database dashboard being developed so
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
the public in a very transparent way can
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
see what schools have sampled which ones
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
have issues and which ones have
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
addressed the issues and so essentially
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple year delay but the
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
program is very much on its way to
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
gaining compliance
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
i should note
 
01:54:04.719 --> 01:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
i should note
that

01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
sort of parallel to all that and again
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is largely a lot of outreach and
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance with schools
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's not a system in place for
 
01:54:12.719 --> 01:54:13.830 align:start position:0%
there's not a system in place for
enforcement

01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are legislative initiatives
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
underway that address this area of
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
stature one is senate bill 452 which is
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
still in the senate i believe it goes to
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
finance next and the other is house bill
 
01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
finance next and the other is house bill
14

01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
14
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
21 which was heard by the senate
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
education committee this year
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
combined they substantially change
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
what's in the statute essentially create
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
a pretty um overarching regulatory
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
process for schools to comply with
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and when we talked with the
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
the comm the education committee this
 
01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:46.709 align:start position:0%
the comm the education committee this
week

01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
des really painted a picture of what
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
could happen if both house bill 1421
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
which seems to have pretty broad support
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 452 if they in tandem
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
were both to
 
01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.550 align:start position:0%
were both to
pass

01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
one lowers the standard from 15-5 so you
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot more non-compliance like
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
double the number of non-compliance
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
which might be appropriate but it
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
creates work
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
and another provision of one of the
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
bills house bill 1421 would actually
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
require that we administer these
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
requirements and fine people if they
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
don't comply and so we painted a picture
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the education committee whereby we
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be regulating 1500 entities
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
between schools and child care
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
facilities 20 to 30 thousand sampling
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
points as your every fixture that's
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
available for drinking water has to be
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
tested and tracked and just told them
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
what it would take you know sending out
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
sampling schedules you know requiring
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
samples processing samples doing
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
violations of samples aren't collected
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
doing violations of you don't mitigate
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
samples a really big regulatory regime
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
for entities environmental services
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
usually don't work with schools that buy
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
water from a water system so we
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
suggested that we have a work session
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
and senator ward's was recepted to that
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
and asked des to prepare some materials
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
to look at maybe another path
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
the thought being that in schools
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
especially in child care facilities
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to every single sink
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
generally to get their drinking water
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's water fountains and bottle fill
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
up stations
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
so using available grant programs or to
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
get more grant funds to maybe establish
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
a program where schools really focus on
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
having points of people for people to
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
get their potable water and that those
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
be tested and that those bottle phillips
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
stations be state of the art maybe go
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
even beyond lead and have ability to
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
filter other things
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
as a way to maybe give schools and
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
shocker facilities a more streamlined
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
process to make sure their water meets
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
standards opposed to tracking 20 to 30
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
000 sampling points at these facilities
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
where people might not be drinking from
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
the janitor some faucet or
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know the the sink in the english
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
room so
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh senator ward just asked us for more
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
information on other ideas and we're
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
preparing that this wednesday so both we
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
have two tracks going one to gain
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the current statute
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
i guess three tracks three to create a
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive regulatory regime which
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
des thinks we have a lot of concerns
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
about and we think regulated entities
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
will have a lot of concerns about once
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
if it got into place and then maybe a
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
third option that's really just focusing
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the points where people drink their
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
water and making sure that water is
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so is
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
is that going to
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
your third point is that going to get
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
into a amendment
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that senator ward's
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
intention she
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
asked us to combine 1421
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1421 and senate bill 452
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
which again
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
when put together have a lot different
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
effects than
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
apart and then to work in this third
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
option as well
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
so that there's not this whole new
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um of the my question is of
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the 1.6 million dollars
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
that we appropriated four years ago now
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
has only and forty four thousand dollars
 
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.109 align:start position:0%
has only and forty four thousand dollars
been

01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:10.629 align:start position:0%
been
encumbered

01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
encumbered
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
why so little when a third of the
 
01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.629 align:start position:0%
why so little when a third of the
schools

01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
are testing above the allowable amount
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
so those numbers are correct a lot a
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
large part of it has to do with one
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's been no system in place and no
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
staffing in place until the last six
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
months really to reach out to schools
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
and connect them
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
with the results and to the available
 
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.350 align:start position:0%
with the results and to the available
funds

01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
another option might be that
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
these are fixtures that aren't really
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
used for potable water and so they put
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
up a sign instead of
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
applying for a five thousand dollar
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
grant or something to mitigate it
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
the data you see here is pretty coarse
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
what we really can't connect those
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
results to is exactly how often those
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
sources are being used for drinking
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
water at this point and that's what's
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
being fixed with trupani the contractor
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's now been hired and then the
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
temporary part-time position
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
the data is going to mean a lot more
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
over the next year and you're going to
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
see a lot more use of those funds
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we may go back to the trust fund and
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
ask them to
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
change those parameters to also allow
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
child care facilities to be eligible
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
because they have to comply with this
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
requirement right now only schools can
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe to even entertain these bottle
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
fill up stations you know focus points
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
of drinking water opposed to mitigating
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
only fixtures that are over the action
 
01:59:28.239 --> 01:59:31.990 align:start position:0%
only fixtures that are over the action
level

01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative emrick
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
would i be naive to think that a
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
town i live in hampton
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
we have a private water but if for the
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
whole town would i be naive to think
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
that if you just tested the water
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
supplier you wouldn't need to test every
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
location in every school
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
for most contaminants your suggestion is
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
correct but not for lead lead is a
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
plumbing based contaminant it comes from
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
the pipes and so or fixtures okay thank
 
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.430 align:start position:0%
the pipes and so or fixtures okay thank
you

02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes represent edwards uh thank you madam
 
02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:09.669 align:start position:0%
yes represent edwards uh thank you madam
chair

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
as i understand it we have a compliance
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
children being tested for lead poisoning
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
you may know that there's two age points
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
where they're supposed to get lead
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
tested and and one is earl very early
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
after they've been born the other ones i
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
guess before they go into the school
 
02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
guess before they go into the school
system

02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
are

02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
are you the right people to to work with
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
to develop an educational program for
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
parents intended for parents so that
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
parents know why they should
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
seek out lead poison testing for their
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
children or who who might be accountable
 
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
for developing testing that would make
 
02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
for developing testing that would make
our

02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
public smarter about why we want them
 
02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.030 align:start position:0%
public smarter about why we want them
tested

02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
tested
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
the department of health hume services
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
has a whole program that oversees the
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
childhood testing and so i don't know if
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
anyone here is able to speak to that
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
from hhs but certainly that agency that
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
takes the lead and they they collaborate
 
02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
with us you know to extend they have a
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
child with high blood levels they'll
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
work with us to get the water tested and
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure if it's a school concern they
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
work with department of education but
 
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i just i just want to say with the
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education in here one
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
proposal that we have in legislation is
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
to expect the schools to be more of an
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
enforcer on parental compliance with
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
lead testing and and i'd much rather see
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
us go down the education role than the
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further i had no idea
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
this was going to open up so much
 
02:01:57.199 --> 02:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
this was going to open up so much
information

02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
when i
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
asked my
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
question but i really thank you for that
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and for your work and i know that
 
02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:08.790 align:start position:0%
and uh and for your work and i know that
sometimes

02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
getting um
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
non-state agencies to cooperate and
 
02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
non-state agencies to cooperate and
to

02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
to do the things they need to do
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
is is difficult so
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
keep on them
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.159 --> 02:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yes go ahead pull your
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
microphone closer
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
my first question is how do they
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
remediate this because there's miles and
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
miles of plumbing in these schools
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
and do do they go through you
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
to get a grant
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
to remediate the problem
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
to remediate the problems with several
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
options you can often replace an older
 
02:02:49.599 --> 02:02:50.709 align:start position:0%
options you can often replace an older
fixture

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
fixture
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
older plumbing components are allowed to
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
have more lead in the wetted area of the
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
fixture so that could be an option
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
you could also put an inline filter
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
that removes the lead as well
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
and then yes there is right now a grant
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
program that pays 50 of the remedial
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
costs for schools not for child care
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and the department of
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
education administers that the
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
administration thank you very much
 
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.669 align:start position:0%
administration thank you very much
okay

02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
oh wait we've got one more question
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
clarify whether there's any legislation
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
coming forward to add child care
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
facilities to this program
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's already there the statute requires
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
child care facilities sample but they
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't have access to the 1.6 million
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
dollar grant right now
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund and so yeah we are
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
working to find options it could be that
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
we go back to the trust fund which is
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislators and appointments members of
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
or potentially there's arpa dollars
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
allocated for drinking water that we
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
might be able to use and then even
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
health and human services have some
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
options and they're the ones that
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
oversee child care facilities that might
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
be able to help with that
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
so is there any legislation coming
 
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
so is there any legislation coming
forward

02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
to address the fact that they can't
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
access these funds the drinking water
 
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.870 align:start position:0%
access these funds the drinking water
funds

02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
i not at this time i don't think the
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism is necessarily a legislative
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
action though i think it's
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
tweaking or making decisions with
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
available funds thank you
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay can we move on
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:04:24.719 --> 02:04:26.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
um

02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's office for emergency
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
relief and recovery
 
02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.189 align:start position:0%
relief and recovery
um

02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:34.069 align:start position:0%
um

02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
provided us last month with
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
the status of cares funding
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
and this month
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%

02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
to talk to us
 
02:04:47.199 --> 02:04:48.069 align:start position:0%
to talk to us
about

02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
what goes on with our
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
happy to be here
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
again good afternoon everybody i think
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
we wanted to
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
come back last month we got a chance to
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about cares act and
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
sort of where
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
things stood with that i wanted to come
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
back today and give you sort of an
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
update on where things stand with the
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
arpa funding and
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
in particular uh the portion that gopher
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
has some a good degree of involvement
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
with which is with the state and local
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal recovery fund dollars which i can
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
get into it a little bit more
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
as we go along here
 
02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.990 align:start position:0%
as we go along here
um

02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of things first uh
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
with regard to dates and importance and
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
timeline because this is obviously
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
setting a little bit of the stage for
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
where we are with uh with arpa
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll mention this again later
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
probably is the fact that this is a
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
program that is fundamentally different
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
from the cares act cares act funds were
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
really there for relief purposes
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
these funds have been provided
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the context of recovery and if you
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
sort of take a moment to think about
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
what that distinction is it does help
 
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:16.870 align:start position:0%
what that distinction is it does help
drive

02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
drive
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh some of the types of projects that
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing coming through and that you
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
all are seeing as as they get to you
 
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:24.709 align:start position:0%
all are seeing as as they get to you
um

02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan was signed into
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
law just about a year ago march 11th of
 
02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.790 align:start position:0%
law just about a year ago march 11th of
2021

02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently in may of 2021 we
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
got what's called the interim final rule
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
which was a document of about 40 or 50
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
pages that gave us a good sense in terms
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
of where the general
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
funding should be used how it should be
 
02:06:50.079 --> 02:06:51.510 align:start position:0%
funding should be used how it should be
used

02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
different buckets and expenditure
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
categories were provided
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and laid for sort of the reporting
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that we're going to go with
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
these resources
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have we've been and we continue to
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
operate under the ifr
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
in uh january of this year
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh treasury came back with
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
the the uh no longer interim final rule
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
but the final final final rule
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that uh document uh exceeds for
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
400 pages uh and gave us a significant
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
significantly more detailed
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
sense of where these
 
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.109 align:start position:0%
sense of where these
funds

02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
how they expect us to report and the
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
data that they need in order to
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
complete the program and so on and so
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
forth and we've spent a good amount of
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
time going through all of those and
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
i will say that you know in the most
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
part that's a lot of what you see coming
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
to you are
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
projects that are fitting these
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
increasingly new
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
categories and
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
and lastly of course as you all know
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
quite well
 
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
there are two important dates with all
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
arpa projects in that
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
the first is december 31st 2024 that's
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
the date by which we have to obligate
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
these resources under fiscal recovery
 
02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
these resources under fiscal recovery
fund

02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
and then december 31st 2026 which is the
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
point at which we have to have spent
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
again going as i mentioned the state and
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
local fiscal recovery fund
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is one portion of the american
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
rescue plan funds that have come to new
 
02:08:33.599 --> 02:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
rescue plan funds that have come to new
hampshire

02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:35.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire
i

02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we are certainly subject
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
to all the federal regulations under
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
this program the total
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
that uh has been designated by the fed
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
federal government under again fraf
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
is specifically nine hundred ninety four
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
million five hundred and fifty five
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and seventy eight
 
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.510 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and seventy eight
dollars

02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we are i think
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
in your documents that we provided it
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
gives you an update as to where we stand
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
obligation of those resources
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of the
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
major requirements that i mentioned
 
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
major requirements that i mentioned
under

02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
under the federal guidance under federal
 
02:09:18.159 --> 02:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
under the federal guidance under federal
rules

02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
defines specifically the types of
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
eligibilities they generically fall
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
under categories like public health
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
negative economic impacts and
 
02:09:28.159 --> 02:09:30.310 align:start position:0%
negative economic impacts and
infrastructure

02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we provide and
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
everything that um that we end up uh
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
getting approval to move forward with
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
has to fall in and align with these
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure categories that are lined
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
out in the final rule
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh i would also mention that in every
 
02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh i would also mention that in every
case

02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
these funds well it
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
in some cases it depends on the level of
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
the expenditure but in almost all cases
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
federal procurement rules
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
are required to be followed as our
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
federal labor laws things like davis
 
02:10:01.199 --> 02:10:02.149 align:start position:0%
federal labor laws things like davis
bacon

02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
bacon
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
and environmental
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
rules all need to be complied with by
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
the end user of these projects of these
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
pro funds i should say
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
and i did mention the deadlines that
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
shows up many times here in my notes
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
gopher's responsibility primarily in a
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of cases has been
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
both to do the reporting and the data
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
analysis and
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
all of the required submissions to the
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
but we also work very closely with all
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
other state agencies and with
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
other recipients of these resources
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to make sure that the
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
data they're collecting is adequate and
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to meet the reporting
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that goes into
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned there are a number of
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
programs that that you are seeing
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
requests for as we go through here that
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
are not specifically
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the state and local
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
federal recovery funds
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um i thought i'd mention a couple of
 
02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
um i thought i'd mention a couple of
those

02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
um the rental assistance program that
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
we've talked about many times is
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
separate from that
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
the capital project funds
 
02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.270 align:start position:0%
the capital project funds
which

02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
we will start seeing some more activity
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of months this is
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
primarily the broadband
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
funding that is available that total uh
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
allocated to new hampshire that we have
 
02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
allocated to new hampshire that we have
not

02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
yet deployed uh is uh 122 million
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
dollars under the capital project fund
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
again that's separate from these frf
 
02:11:36.239 --> 02:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
again that's separate from these frf
dollars

02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
the housing assistance fund
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is program that we talked about i
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
think just a few weeks ago and is just
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
now getting started up uh to assist
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
for homeowners as opposed to rentals
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then it also does not include
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
all the funding that will start flowing
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
under the infrastructure
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill that congress passed subsequently
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be run primarily with
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation so as
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
that money starts to flow i imagine
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner sheehan here more regularly
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh and of course hhs
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh has uh also seen a significant amount
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
of resource that they're putting for
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
toward a number of different obvious
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
public health and health related and
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
on the where we are right now of course
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
i i we provided you the most recent
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
update as to the list of the
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
programs that have been
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
obligated and approved here at joint
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
they're really falling into a number of
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
pretty large categories there's
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the water and sewer
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that was done pretty
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
early on then most of that at least
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
under frf is being run by
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
those funds as you'll recall we moved
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly just because of the time
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
horizon that is necessary for those
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
types of projects and you know that we
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
do have to have this money spent by 2026
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
which seems like a long way away unless
 
02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:15.669 align:start position:0%
which seems like a long way away unless
you're

02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
trying to permit and move a lot of these
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
projects all at the same time
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
mental and behavioral health obviously
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
continues to be an area where you're
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of these programs
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 response
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
at least so far has been a continuing
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
number we hope that we're going to
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
continue to see those numbers start to
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
fall off a little bit and then of course
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the economic
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
relief and development area
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
gopher is in the context of in addition
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
to all the reporting that goes on we
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
spend a significant amount of time
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing proposals from different
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and from other parties around
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility and the cost of those
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
programs and looking for areas where
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
there may be duplication and overlap
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
among existing programs that we seek to
 
02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
among existing programs that we seek to
avoid

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
as you've heard me say many times the
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
primary function and purpose of these
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
dollars hopefully in most cases is to be
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
able to make those like one-time
 
02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:15.430 align:start position:0%
able to make those like one-time
investments

02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
in um initiatives and programs and
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that are going to carry
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
us forward
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time and not
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily get the state into a
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
position where we're going to have
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing operational costs as a result of
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
these investments
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
and of course as you well know
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
everything that ends up making its way
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
we end up talking about in one form or
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
another here in this forum so
 
02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:44.149 align:start position:0%
another here in this forum so
um

02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where we are right
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
now um
 
02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
now um
uh

02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
and uh of course i'm always
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have and i
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say uh you know we
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate all of you working
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
on these items as they come through on a
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
and really appreciate all the time that
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're putting into taking a look at
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
what we've what we've been able to do at
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
least thus far
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes senator
 
02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:15.669 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes senator
daniels

02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
daniels
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to the mandates that come
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
from epa regarding water and waste water
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
mandates that opera money could could
 
02:15:27.679 --> 02:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
mandates that opera money could could
cover

02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
are you talking about
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory mandates that right i'm
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
saying like in in our town you know
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking at eight to ten million
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of federal mandates
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that are placed on us for water or
 
02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
that that are placed on us for water or
wastewater

02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i'm always looking just
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
at what the federal government is
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
placing on us for mandates and asking
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know uh are they supplying the money
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
well in this case here some of the money
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
is being supplied and we may be able to
 
02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.390 align:start position:0%
is being supplied and we may be able to
use

02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
that water and wastewater
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
money that comes in to take care of some
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
of those mandates but on the other
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
categories that you have identified i'm
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are any other
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
mandates in there that we could go back
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and tell our constituents we've got
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
federal money that's going to cover that
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
well i guess it would be hard to say
 
02:16:23.679 --> 02:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
well i guess it would be hard to say
without

02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
knowing specifically uh the case but i
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
but i guess what i would say senator is
 
02:16:30.079 --> 02:16:31.669 align:start position:0%
but i guess what i would say senator is
that

02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
we are not seeing that there is
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily relief from those federal
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
mandates in the use of these funds
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
so in those instances where des is
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
having to
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
move these resources out into our
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
communities for water and sewer
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
upgrades or projects
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
we continue to have the same
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and permitting requirements
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
that are required both by the state and
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
in fact you might recall i think we had
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
an item
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
some time ago for des to add staff
 
02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:08.070 align:start position:0%
some time ago for des to add staff
for

02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
the permitting office specifically for
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
that purpose and that this was going to
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
generate some additional pressure on
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
that office
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
to uh to move those projects quickly
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions yeah yes
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
i did notice in a
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
in a couple of categories
 
02:17:34.319 --> 02:17:35.270 align:start position:0%
in a couple of categories
um

02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
you refer to personnel cost um can you
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
how you're
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
using these dollars
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
around personnel i know
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce is is really
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
an issue for so many areas
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
well i mean leaving the workforce issue
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
aside and finding people to fill these
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
positions which is
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
another issue
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
i know you've talked about already today
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i was going to ask michael caine
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
where he was getting his person from you
 
02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
know how much are you paying them
 
02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:13.669 align:start position:0%
know how much are you paying them
[Music]

02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
um but to your question all of the all
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the requests that are coming through
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
for these types of funds for
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh for staffing my department my other
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
department included are for 90 positions
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
so these are temporary jobs that are
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
tied to the funding um that ultimately
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
they'll be dealing with so the intention
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
is not to necessarily
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
extend beyond the life of the arpa funds
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
with these dollars for the temporary
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
staff that typically is coming
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
a follow-up yes please i was looking at
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
one it was uh it's on um
 
02:18:54.719 --> 02:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
one it was uh it's on um
the

02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
appendix too
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
it's the wage enhancement for
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
the um licensing of nursing assistants
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering about that kind of a
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
program and how that that kind of
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
program is working oh i'm trying to
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
remember that would you mind just
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
mentioning the item you're looking at
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
um it's

chase hageman deputy director at gopher
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's probably a poor
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
characterization of what that program
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
did it was actually a
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
an amount of money given per bed at that
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
facility the facility could then use
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
as it needed and it may have used it for
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
assisting with wages to retain or
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%

02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay i do have a i have a further
 
02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
okay i do have a i have a further
question

02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at your first page that's
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
got the little blue thing
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
and it's showing that we have uh
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
497 million dollars left
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
four years to allocate it
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
and spend it
 
02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:23.670 align:start position:0%
and spend it
yes

02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
2026. yeah so
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
when are we going to
 
02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
when are we going to
gets

02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
gets
 
02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
gets
something

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:31.290 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:20:31.290 --> 02:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
something
[Music]

02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
on the other
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
497 million
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
i mean we're chipping away at it but
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
i think like today would we have uh
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
23 million that that doesn't chip away
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
very much
so

02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:47.359 --> 02:20:50.469 align:start position:0%
so
and

02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy to spend a billion
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
dollars as you might think but i i you
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
know my my concern is okay that as we
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
start getting into um
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know budget season next year and all
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
mess that goes along with that that uh
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know we on the uh
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
physical committee are basically all
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
tied up in that stuff and uh
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know the
 
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know the
people

02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:25.030 align:start position:0%
people
um

02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
various departments are starting to
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
think about preparing budgets and
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know i just i i'm just concerned
 
02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.389 align:start position:0%
you know i just i i'm just concerned
that

02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how to spend it
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
quicker where you know where we are and
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess if um
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
i could say if anybody has any wonderful
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
ideas they can either um
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
talk to uh commissioner caswell or
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
myself but uh
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know i just you understand where i'm
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
coming from yes ma'am
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
and uh it's and no we cannot give it to
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
each one of us for
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced salary for our positions
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
i've already tried that yeah
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
are there any even if we doubled it i'm
 
02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:18.890 align:start position:0%
not sure that would spend much man
 
02:22:18.890 --> 02:22:19.190 align:start position:0%
not sure that would spend much man
[Music]

02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
[Laughter]

02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think you're right are there any yes
 
02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:24.469 align:start position:0%
i think you're right are there any yes
uh

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative walner you're looking for
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
the pay raise
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
no i'm looking not looking for the pay
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
raise i think we're paid adequately here
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
100 every year
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
so you're setting aside money for each
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
of these projects
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm you're setting aside money
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
for each of these projects or funds for
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
each of these projects but as we get
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.429 align:start position:0%
closer to
2026

02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
2026
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
some of these projects probably won't
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
spin down
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
all that you set aside yep so there will
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
be some funds left will the federal
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
government allow us to have any access
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
those funds after 2026. i'm not sure
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a official answer to that
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
question but to your point
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases particularly in the
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
larger number cases that we know are
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to go on for a period of time we
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually build in a
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
an expiration date in the contracts
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
well before we get to the end
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
with the ability to extend but it gives
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
us that opportunity to make sure that
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're not just leaving everything until
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
december 30th 2026 and saying let's see
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
how much we got left i mean we don't
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
want to be in that position
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
so um yeah we're very cognizant of that
 
02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
so um yeah we're very cognizant of that
and

02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
under very specific orders to make sure
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
we don't leave any money on the table if
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we had that cares act thing
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
that you know the waterfall yeah we got
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
a little close to the end on that
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh making sure that we got that
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
money approved that was like an eight
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
month program remember initially i know
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we already didn't have a lot of
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
time for that money
 
02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:14.550 align:start position:0%
time for that money
okay

02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate it and
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh i know that if anyone has any
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions i can always give you a call
 
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you thank you i
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
would like to point out
 
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
would like to point out
just

02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
before we have just a couple things to
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
finish up
 
02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:35.750 align:start position:0%
finish up
but

02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to be asking the departments to
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about their
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that have not come through
 
02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.389 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that have not come through
gopher

02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
and there are lots and lots and lots of
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
dollars out there
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we're going to be starting next
 
02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.750 align:start position:0%
and uh we're going to be starting next
month

02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
with hhs and des
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
coming in to uh to talk to us about that
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
because i think that you know we as the
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
keeper of the dollar so to speak
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
folks responsible for that money
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll see what happens um you know
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll rotate it around so that
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
every department that's received
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
offline arpa money i know that's the
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
wrong term but
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
other arpa money

good morning madam chair and members of
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record my
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
name is kimberly bisson i'm here today
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
to present the management letter which
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
is a byproduct of our audit of the
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
lottery's fiscal year 2021 financial
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
statements which were previously
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee at the
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the table of contents you
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
will see that the report includes three
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
internal control comments one of which
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
is considered to be a material weakness
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
the lottery concurs with all three
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
comments and none suggests legislative
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
action is required
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
the observations begin on page three
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
observation number one discusses several
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in internal control which
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
combine to result in a material weakness
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the lottery sports betting revenue
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
and contract monitoring processes
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
to address this we recommend that
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
lottery take steps to formally document
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
its policies and procedures covering the
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
major areas of its sports betting
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
operations and to amend its contract to
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
require the sports betting vendor obtain
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
a service organization control report
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire lottery on an
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
we also recommend that lottery implement
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures to assess risks
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
related to outsourced services including
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
identifying when service organization
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
control reports should be written into
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
turning to page seven
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
observation number two recommends the
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
lottery enhance its financial accounting
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
and reporting staff by establishing a
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
director of finance or similar position
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
in order to support the ever-increasing
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
scope and complexity in lottery
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
operations and to mitigate the risk of
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
relying on the performance of one
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
employee for all financial accounting
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
and reporting activities
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
additionally lottery should take steps
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
to formally document policies and
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
procedures that address the significant
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of its financial reporting
 
02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
aspects of its financial reporting
process

02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
development of significant accounting
 
02:29:01.469 --> 02:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
estimates completion of monthly
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
reconciliations preparation of year-end
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
adjusting and accrual entries and the
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
compilation of its annual comprehensive
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
finally observation number three
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
beginning on page nine recommends that
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
the lottery is administratively attached
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
council for responsible gambling
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
implement formal policies and procedures
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure all invoices are adequately
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
supported in accordance with contracted
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
terms and ensure duties within the
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
council are appropriately segregated to
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
allow for an independent review of
 
02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
invoices prior to submission to the
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
lottery commission for payment
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the council also
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
the appendix located behind the tab on
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
page 11 reports the current status as of
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%

do we get feedback on
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%

02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
every year and so they'll be back
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i always say i'm going to miss if you
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
never leave um and i may say that
 
02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
never leave um and i may say that
kiddingly

02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
kiddingly
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
but certainly they'll be back in june to
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
for their audit and so like our example
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
the sock 2 report request um i've
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
already signed an agreement with
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
draftkings they'll have that it's
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
already being implemented as we speak so
 
02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
already being implemented as we speak so
um

02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
as you can see three findings is not bad
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
and one of them is not me or us really
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i think two is pretty good but yeah
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%

just yeah and and maybe you know i don't
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
i don't need anything really formal i
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
on each of the audits that we are
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
making progress and not just letting it
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
hang around
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
yes but if i may man i'm chair um as you
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
know we we audit the lottery commission
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
every year right so you have three years
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
worth of observations in front of you
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
with the status of them
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
so for example the
 
02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
2019 when we come back in for the fiscal
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
22 audit excuse me yeah fiscal 22 audit
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
if not if if if those remain unresolved
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
more than likely they're going to make
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
it into the body of the
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
management letter next year so we
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
we might we we evaluate as what the
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
status is based on working with the
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
commit with the
 
02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
commit with the
commission

02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
we won't let them just
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
fall away without
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
well so you know because there was one
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know hadn't
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
nothing had been done on it
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
that was from what two years ago or
 
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:18.150 align:start position:0%
that was from what two years ago or
something

02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes it actually was specifically to a
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
our sports betting vendor partner not
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
providing a sock to report um i signed
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
an agreement uh a change order with them
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think in january so going forward
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting that
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
every year so that's the one that was
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
unresolved and that had to do with
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
um draftkings changed out a significant
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
portion of its business it had
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
previously contracted for
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
market creation services through a
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
company called camby they ended up
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
buying a company called sb tech so they
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know they changed out the
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
transmission while the car was still
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
running essentially so
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
getting a stock to report previously
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense okay thank you all
 
02:34:02.399 --> 02:34:03.190 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense okay thank you all
right

02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and uh keep up the good
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
work and uh keep sending money to the
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
education trust fund doing our best
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
our next management letters for the uh
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%

02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record my
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
name is jim lariviere
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
we are here to present the management
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
letter a byproduct of our audit of the
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
liquor commission's fiscal year 2021
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
financial statements which were
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
previously presented to the committee at
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
the january 21st meeting
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the table of contents you
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
will see that the report includes one
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
internal control comment classified as a
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
significant deficiency
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
the commission concurs with the comment
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
and no legislative action is required
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
the observation on page three
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
identified where significant errors
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
detailed in items numbers one and two of
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
the observation were made
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
detected and corrected but lacked
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
documentation explaining the cause of
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
the errors and the adjustments made to
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
correct system accounting records
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
and lacked evidence of management's
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
review and approval
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
we recommend the commission establish
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
formal policies and procedures for
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
adjusting system accounting records
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
the policies and procedures should
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
detail the processes to be performed who
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
performs each process
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
and adequate and addresses adequately
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
documenting the error and corrective
 
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
documenting the error and corrective
actions

02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
actions
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
all adjustments should be reviewed and
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
approved by an appropriate level of
 
02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
approved by an appropriate level of
management

02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
independent of the posting and
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
the appendix located behind the tab on
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
page five reports the current status
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
as of december 17
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%

02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
liquor commission management letters
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
as noted at the bottom of page 8
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
10 comments were fully resolved and
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
eight comments were in the process of
 
02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:54.070 align:start position:0%
eight comments were in the process of
remediation

02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
this concludes my presentation
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank chairman mulika and
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%

the audit
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
with your permission madam chair i'd
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
like to now turn the presentation over
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the liquor commission's chairman
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman malika
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
before you do that can i just ask a
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
question on the finding certainly um
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
you show two examples here of one of 48
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
million and the other one of 1.4 million
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
every error should have some sort of
 
02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
supervisory signature on it
 
02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:38.630 align:start position:0%
supervisory signature on it
and

02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
i would hope that
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
we would give the
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:52.150 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
people

02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
author you know without going up the
 
02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:57.270 align:start position:0%
author you know without going up the
chain

02:37:57.270 --> 02:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
chain
 
02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
chain
for

02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
some amount of money
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
that you know there's an air you know i
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
mean it could be a typo you know it
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
something else but
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
i i would certainly think that
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know if if i made a thousand dollar
 
02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:15.190 align:start position:0%
you know if if i made a thousand dollar
error

02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
error
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
that i caught at the end of the month i
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to fix that without going
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
three steps up in supervision
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
where if over time
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
i find that i've got
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
a 1.4 million dollar thing then yes i
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
think we need to
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
we need to check that out
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
and figure out what's going on in our
 
02:38:38.399 --> 02:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
and figure out what's going on in our
processes

02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
processes
 
02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
processes
