1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to gavel this committee of conference into order.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.500
This is on a committee of conference on house bill 1299.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
There's been an amendment submitted to all members.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
I had a conversation with Senator Avard.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This amendment just puts the process in alignment with all the other appeals processes that happen at Fish and Game where the decision is made by the chief.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.500
And then if the decision of the chief wants to be appealed, that appeal goes to the executive director.

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.500
This amendment puts this process in alignment with all those other processes.

9
00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:01.500
And I understand from Senator Avard, the Senate will agree to the amendment and will accede to the Senate position with the minor changes.

10
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Is that correct?

11
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Mr.

12
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Chairman, that is correct.

13
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
speaking for Senator Avard and the Senate members.

14
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.000
We accept that amendment that makes the director the appeal person and the Senate members.

15
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We accept that amendment that makes the director, the appeal person, and the chief of wildlife, the applicant's first step.

16
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And so I've reviewed the amendment as has Senator Rayvard.

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We are in concurrence with that amendment, and we are grateful for your accession to the Senate position.

18
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
And with that, the meeting is closed.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.500
Thank you.

204
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.500
Good afternoon, everyone.

205
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:06.000
We will now call the order of the Committee of Conference on House Bill 1476.

206
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.500
So, anything change from yesterday?

207
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.000
Yeah, Senator Seuss has said it's raining.

208
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.500
um no i think the focus should be on violent offenders.

209
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:24.500
And we hope that, you know, you folks would proceed to the Senate position.

210
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:34.500
And, you know, with a week for the advocates to work this, I think you have a shot at it.

211
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.500
And that's all we can ask.

212
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:57.000
I think, as I think, you know, in listening to what you folks were saying yesterday, you think the focus should be on violent criminals, but you're concerned about not being able to get it across the finish line.

213
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.500
And I just would remind you that when it went to the floor, it wasn't your language.

214
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.500
It was the language in 294.

215
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.500
So your language is different, better, quite frankly.

216
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:23.000
And when 294 went to the floor was without recommendation, This would be a affirmative vote of the committee of conference.

217
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The advocates would work incredibly hard.

218
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
They promised me that.

219
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Give it a shot.

220
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Representative Rhodes.

221
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Thank you, Mr.

222
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Chairman.

223
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So I think I'm a little bit confused because my understanding of a committee of conferences to come both sit down at the table.

224
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And it appears to me that if your position is already made, it kind of puts us in a hard spot to start out.

225
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But with that being said, we heard from law enforcement.

226
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:20.500
And when we actually had the opportunities to hear from the victims, which sadly isn't often because usually they're intimidating to submission, is that these most egregious crimes are often repeated.

227
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.500
It is repeated behavior.

228
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.500
We hear that all the time.

229
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
They're all sitting here.

230
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.500
They're all telling you that all over again.

231
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.500
So I'm just confused on why this is so confusing.

232
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:52.500
And I think that I would like to know what it is about the House's position that is so egregious to the Senate that you hold repeat offenders to a higher standard.

233
00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:04.500
As I tried to explain yesterday, the original version of my bill, Senate Bill 294, had a provision similar to Ross's in that bill.

234
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.000
It was at the suggestion of Representative Abbas, I removed that.

235
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Happy to put that back in.

236
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But I think if you bring some of the law enforcement folks that are here and put them there and ask them the question as to what's the most important, they're going to tell you it's the Senate version of the bill.

237
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.500
And that's why we're here to stress violent criminals.

238
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.500
I want to do something about repeat offenders.

239
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.000
Don't get me wrong, but not at the expense of dropping violent criminal.

240
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.500
Just to make sure we're all talking about the same sections of what was 294.

241
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:11.000
There was one section that had to do with if you have been charged with a drunk driving, class A misdemeanor, or a felony while out on bail already.

242
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.500
And now you get a third time that happens.

243
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500
You now have three open cases while out on bail.

244
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:31.500
At that, there was one section that would apply where a person would then be held, the presumption that they'll be held.

245
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:38.500
And the reason why is they won't comply with the conditions of their release.

246
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.500
So they're now in pretrial detention.

247
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.500
That's one section.

248
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:51.000
What 1476 addresses is simply a person's out on bail or they're awaiting a sentence.

249
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They get arrested, which is a violation of their bail.

250
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But this is not necessarily related to the pretrial detention.

251
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:38.500
This is what you do between the time the person's been arrested and whether they're brought before court and this says a time where they'll be held they basically will be held and brought before a judge to decide whether they should be released that's what 1476 does so the repeat offenders side of it we're not necessarily this is not the house position will not necessarily result in someone being held in pre-child detention.

252
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:47.000
They're just not going to get released that same day, at least in all likelihood they won't.

253
00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And that's somewhat similar to the Senate position, which is, I helped draft, but that has to do with someone who's not necessarily out on bail.

254
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.500
They're being brought before a judge as opposed to a bail commissioner because of the nature of the offense.

255
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:22.500
So I guess the question I have is if the House position, if we could pass the House position, why can't we pass the Senate position?

256
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
They can be together.

257
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.000
I'm just wondering why can't they coexist because they don't conflict.

258
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.500
We would need to take a recess to think about that.

259
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.500
If they don't conflict, we'd be in favor of that, I think.

260
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.000
I'd want to, you know, poll the other senators.

261
00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:04.500
But if technically they hold together, and I think we'd want to, you know, talk to our law enforcement friends and maybe put them right up here and ask them, we want to deal with repeat offenders.

262
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:23.500
But again, and I'm sorry to keep sounding like a broken record, but it was your suggestion that we took out the repeat offender provision so that it would give you a better opportunity to get it passed.

263
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500
So I will tell you this.

264
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:35.500
The motion to table, which I opposed, I did the PI to opposing that, it wasn't even close.

265
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:42.000
When I say it wasn't close, was it 85 votes we were short?

266
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.500
No, you were short hundreds.

267
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
Hundreds.

268
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
If I may, Mr.

269
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
Chairman.

270
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.500
Senator Barry.

271
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Senator Bradley keeps saying you, you, you, you.

272
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500
He's referencing you, Mr.

273
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.500
Chairman.

274
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.000
He's not referencing the House.

275
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
The House sent over its reform.

276
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It was 1476.

277
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:26.500
I would be amenable to the idea of combining the two because, as I said, the way we would have to combine them would have to be some form in which the House position is the base.

278
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:35.000
And the reason is, is I have to go back to the House and get the votes.

279
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And if it is interpreted as being based off of the Senate position, it is dead.

280
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
It's just done so.

281
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:59.000
If it is crafted off of the House position, it is an easier sell for me to go get the votes that we need to get it passed.

282
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
The members of law enforcement were in favor of HB 1476 when the House passed it.

283
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I don't know what happened when it came over to the Senate.

284
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:59.500
They indicated they're in favor of what you passed, maybe we can have our cake and eat it too if you guys want to recess i think that would i'm not the chairman but i definitely would uh i definitely would think that would be appropriate i just want to ask one question if i may before we return if so looking at the house version i'm on line seven and eight If the issue is repeat offense and subsequent offense, then why does it include Class B misdemeanors and say shall be?

285
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.500
So it's three arrests for Class B misdemeanors.

286
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.500
There are some serious Class B misdemeanors such as DWI.

287
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.000
These aren't just like jaywalking.

288
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.500
There are some serious Class B misdemeanors.

289
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:22.000
I know what class B misdemeanors are, but there's a comma after class B misdemeanor.

290
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
So that's one thing.

291
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And then third or subsequent offense is separate.

292
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So the way this is currently drafted, it's one class B misdemeanor, and then it's subsequent other offenses.

293
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Either you have to take out the comma or you have to rearrange this sentence if you're solely looking at repeat offenders.

294
00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:10.500
So I interpret the same way, and if you can tell by maybe my facial expression, I am surprised how one can pass the house very easily and another can't even make it out of the committee, never mind to the floor for a discussion.

295
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.500
But at the same time, that's what we're dealing with.

296
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:22.500
So the logic of how this is playing out, I've given up on that.

297
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.500
Wait a minute, Mr.

298
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500
Chairman.

299
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500
I agree.

300
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Take the calm out.

301
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
Make it the same.

302
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:42.000
We're not going to let who goes first, calm us, but we're coming out of here with something today.

303
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.500
So let's get this fixed.

304
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.500
Take whatever.

305
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.500
Take the comm out.

306
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
And let's do this.

307
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500
Combine them.

308
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.500
Can we have a couple of minute recess?

309
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.000
We can take a break.

310
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Okay.

311
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.500
I have a 1.30 conference with you, unless you've been replaced.

312
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500
I'll follow you.

313
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.500
Thank you.

314
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.500
Thank you.

315
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.500
Thank you.

316
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500
Thank you.

317
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500
Thank you.

318
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.500
Thank you.

319
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.500
Thank you.

320
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500
Thank you.

321
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.500
Good afternoon again.

322
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:33.500
We'll now call the order of the Committee of Conference again on HB 1476.

323
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:41.500
So we'd like to offer a compromise marrying the two versions, the House and Senate version.

324
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.000
So the Senate version would remain intact as it is presented.

325
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And we would suggest amending the House version, starting on line seven, delete the word may.

326
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:39.500
So it reads, or a person charged with a class B misdemeanor, remove that comma, third or subsequent offense, may replace shall with may be detained for a period of not more than 36 hours from the time of arrest excluding Saturday Sundays and holidays then we would remove starting on line 17 and notwithstanding paragraph three shall be held in preventive detention right well we would take that part out though we would We would say you are detained without bail, pending a hearing before a judge, period.

327
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:47.500
And then the effective date would have to be January 1st to effectuate the Senate changes.

328
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.500
If we could, if you would indulge Mr.

329
00:21:51.500 --> 00:22:01.500
Head from the judicial branch, he had a couple of other that he thought possibly we may need to do.

330
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Go ahead.

331
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500
One at a time.

332
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:21.500
So one inconsistency, and this is more technical, under the Senate position, it's 24 to 36 hours, and it kind of explains when the 36 hours would apply as opposed to 24.

333
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500
That was mirrored.

334
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:32.500
When I put that together, that was mirrored after Superior Court Rule 10 and Circuit Court Rule 4.

335
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:39.000
And I know I did discuss that language with the Attorney General's office.

336
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So that begins on page 2 of the Senate version, line 4.

337
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Is that what you're referencing, Mr.

338
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Chairman?

339
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yes.

340
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Okay.

341
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.500
It's lines four and five.

342
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:07.500
I would suggest that we keep the 24 to 36 language from the Senate version and merge that into the House draft.

343
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.500
So the House just says 36.

344
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.000
Now we'll keep the consistency with the court rules.

345
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.500
May I ask a question?

346
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
Representative Barrett.

347
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:30.000
I just want to go over the maize and shalls because that was brought up in the House hearing on 1476.

348
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.500
What is the intention there?

349
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.000
I'm not opposed to it.

350
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.500
I just want to know what the intention is.

351
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.000
To give the court discretion.

352
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Yeah.

354
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yeah.

355
00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:01.500
Because when I wrote it, the point was not that they shall be held for 36 hours, that they shall be held until they see a judge.

356
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:09.000
That was the point of that language, not they shall be held for 36 hours.

357
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
They shall be held for 36 hours or until they see a judge, whichever was first.

358
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
That's what we intended to pass.

359
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.500
So I just want to make sure by May we're not just letting people off.

360
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:34.500
Well, I think what we're trying to do is give the judges greater discretion.

361
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.500
So it's pending.

362
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:49.000
I think the key here is that we retain the language in 18 and 19 that say without bill pending a hearing before a judge.

363
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
The key is...

364
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
So long as it doesn't say after 36.

365
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So if the judge lets them off, that's fine fine but we're still going to hold them for up to 36 hours until they get to the judge that that stays in place that's your understanding okay so so basically we're just because that was the house's position so we're just this is grammatical that's kind of what i'm getting at okay i think by getting and i think we might want to hear from as you perhaps attorney head, and then there are also representatives from law enforcement here that may want to weigh in.

366
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I believe by changing it to May, it's not requiring the person be detained improper before a judge.

367
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.500
They would still be permitted to go before a bail commissioner.

368
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:14.000
I think the idea, at least I understand the intent of 1476 and the House and Senate positions really to not have this hearing before bail commissioners, to have it before a judge.

369
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
So by changing shall to may, I think it's kind of stripping.

370
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:30.500
So you're removing that middle language and you say may may be held without bail, pending a hearing before the judge.

371
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:46.000
A period of not more than 36 hours from the time of their arrest, excluding Sunday's holidays, and we incorporate the other language without bail, pending a hearing before a judge.

372
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.500
They may be held pending a hearing.

373
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.500
So let's just play this out.

374
00:26:52.500 --> 00:27:03.500
So class B misdemeanor, and as I said, we could have others confirm, but it could be a series of petty thefts.

375
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.000
I see what you're saying.

376
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:49.500
There has to be a degree of discretion where we're not tying up the holding stuff for people that stole a banana on one day an apple the next and then once they hit the orange i think i understand what you're saying basically maybe i'm not but you don't want them arrested for something they wouldn't have otherwise been arrested for you mean held held held yeah well because yeah because they could be arrested arrested and released immediately they want them taken to the holding.

377
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.000
Okay, because that's our intention.

378
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Okay, so if that's how it is, then I'm fine with that.

379
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Because I share the – if that is your concern, I share that concern.

380
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.500
Someone who's arrested for picking up a banana should not be.

381
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:30.500
But if it's a defense that involves you going to jail, once you are in jail, you're underneath this system of you're going before a judge if you're on your second or if it's these crimes, you're the first one.

382
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500
Correct?

383
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.500
We're all in agreement on that?

384
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.500
Mr.

385
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500
Chair.

386
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:53.000
If I can just comment, Senator Bradley, that would – the Class B misdemeanors are something that you don't have – you don't go to jail for.

387
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.500
So it would need to be a Class A misdemeanor or a felony.

388
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.000
That's how it would have to read.

389
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.500
You can't keep class B misdemeanor in there in that case.

390
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.000
Now, the confusion link, we included drunk driving in prior versions.

391
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
The reason why was the public safety concern, particularly with that type of crime.

392
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.500
But here, I would just change that to class A misdemeanor or felony, as opposed to saying class B.

393
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:37.000
If they're comfortable with May, there's no reason to change it even more.

394
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000
If they're comfortable with May and that's the intention, let's just leave it at that and move on.

395
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Is that fine with you guys?

396
00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:13.500
I think for, you know, and certainly other members of our committee can chime in, but I think the key portion for us is that there are certain severe penalty, felony crimes, which are delineated here in the Senate version that we believe require a hearing before a judge.

397
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.500
Yeah, we agree with that wholeheartedly.

398
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:32.500
um and that's retained and then we can wordsmith this further and as i said if we hear from others if they're a concern happy to Yeah, we agree with that wholeheartedly.

399
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.500
If that's retained, and then we can wordsmith this further.

400
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:46.500
And as I said, if we hear from others, if they're a concern, happy to keep wordsmithing this.

401
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.000
But I think we can try to marry up the two.

402
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
This is more a process request.

403
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:10.500
What if Representative Barry and Representative Roy Rhodes, Gannon, and Susie work on crafting an amendment that we could come back here at 2.30, and we could hear from law enforcement.

404
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:25.000
I know it's getting tight on the deadline, but you and I have a committee of conference across the city, and then I have the parking garage at 2.

405
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.500
I'm actually chairing that for the House.

406
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.000
I have some good news, Senator Bradley.

407
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.500
I figured this is where we were going to end up, and I submitted this amendment at noon today.

408
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.500
So OLS is already ahead of the game.

409
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.500
With the maze and the commas?

410
00:31:48.500 --> 00:32:01.500
We have to do the maze and the commas, but the Senate's position of violent crimes and the House-based bill, OLS is currently working on it.

411
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:11.000
I know my Senate colleagues are very reasonable, and I figured this is where we're going to end up.

412
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.500
And I knew you had a tight deadline, so I wanted to go ahead and take care of it.

413
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:27.500
And if anybody wants to co-sponsor it with me, they're more than happy to.

414
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:33.000
I think we should refer to it as the Barry Amendment.

415
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I'm good with that.

416
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.500
I just want to get across the street to the next one, given our deadlines.

417
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500
That's all.

418
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.500
So we've got to do a quick vote.

419
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.500
Let's take a vote.

420
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.500
Aye.

421
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500
You're all good?

422
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500
Aye.

423
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.500
A resounding yes.

424
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500
Aye.

425
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.500
Are we going to see the language first?

426
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:10.000
I think we should come back at like 2.15 to 2.30.

427
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
See the language.

428
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
We should be okay.

429
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Let's take a break till give or take around 2.15.

430
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
2.15.

431
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
I can't say that.

432
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Let's take a break to 2.15.

433
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
But is that enough time to have everything signed off by 3?

434
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Yes.

435
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.500
You need to tell me.

436
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:43.500
It should be given that I probably just got the draft in my pocket.

437
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.000
Could you guys please confer with Attorney Head, Bill?

438
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.500
We will take a break.

439
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:58.000
We'd be able to mark it up if we had a copy of the draft.

440
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
The 2.15.

441
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Stay here.

442
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Yeah.

443
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
This is the only one I have left.

444
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.500
Ross, can you share a copy of the draft?

445
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500
Of course.

446
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.500
I don't know if I have it yet.

447
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500
Okay.

448
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500
Can you get OLS?

449
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.000
Actually, they just sent a new one.

450
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Well, here we go.

451
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I will forward it to everyone.

452
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I haven't even read it again.

453
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Okay.

454
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Okay.

455
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Okay.

456
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Okay.

457
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

465
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Okay.

Okay.

467

Okay.

468
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Okay.

469
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Okay.

Thank you.

533
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Thank you.

534
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Thank you.

535
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Thank you.

536
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Thank you.

537
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Thank you.

538
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:52.000
now reconvene the committee conference on house bill 1476 is there a draft is there a draft we have here my understanding is in the house position it was a at the very end there was a provision about not permitting pr bail when someone has been released on bail and violated condition of their release.

539
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
For the third time.

540
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And that's the only thing we're now held up on.

541
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
When did that change?

542
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
From the House position?

543
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.500
That's always been in there.

544
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:36.000
No, when we sat here and we agreed, we went to a different community conference conference now we came back and then it's changed like i don't understand how to change people are allowed to change your mind problem with the pr bail has been with the bail commission that was never discussed here that We've never discussed at this table.

545
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Let's not talk over each other.

546
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
It wasn't.

547
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
The RBL wasn't.

548
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
It's not.

549
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.500
We're not going to talk over each other in here, right?

550
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:56.500
It reminds me of the committee when it's just the House members.

551
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.500
One at a time.

552
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:05.500
The PR bail plank of the House's reform is a key aspect of it.

553
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.500
We have conceded two positions already, 36 to 24, made a shall.

554
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:17.500
It's time that the Senate acquiesced to something that the House wants.

555
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:27.500
It's just – it is a – I am telling you, it is just something that we have to have.

556
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:39.500
It would seem to me that the House position has been opposed consistently to the reforms that the Senate is suggesting on violent crime.

557
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:45.000
And now you are digging in on basically ending PR bail.

558
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
I don't get where you're coming from with these potential small violations.

559
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Yes, they accumulate.

560
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:03.500
But, you know, as Senator Seuss said before, the banana, the orange, the apple, three separate violations, and there's no flexibility.

561
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:13.000
The Senate position has been to go before a judge, and by striking this sentence, that's what it does.

562
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.500
And I think, Representative Perry, when you explain that to the House, they'll get it.

563
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:29.500
You have to explain it, as Senator Soucy has explained it, you know, through this afternoon committee conference.

564
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:36.500
Respectfully, if explaining it was that easy, we wouldn't be in a committee conference.

565
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:46.000
Senator Bradley, my issue is I represent South Willow Street, one of the largest retail strips in the state.

566
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
So we're talking about stealing from stores that I represent.

567
00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:03.500
So I understand that I have to go back to the house, but I also have to go back to the people that elect me.

568
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:10.500
And I actually think I might represent the most retail spots in the state.

569
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.000
I heard Amherst Street in Nashville might have more.

570
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:25.500
It's nice to put up the, oh, it's a banana, it's a banana, it's a banana, but it's not a banana.

571
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:33.000
And somebody owns that store, a small business owner owns that store, and they're out.

572
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.500
And I'm a small business owner, by the way.

573
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.500
So we're not talking, it's not victimless crimes.

574
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:49.000
Theft is theft, and we can try to marginalize it as much as we want.

575
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
These crimes escalate.

576
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And at the end of the day, I go back to we've acquiesced already.

577
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.500
We're telling you we have 15 minutes.

578
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.500
I'm not budging.

579
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.500
I can't speak for the other two representatives.

580
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:13.500
I just spoke with them and they told me they're not budging.

581
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.000
So unless we've moved, this is it.

582
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
And we can let this die right now.

583
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And it is what it is.

584
00:42:24.000 --> 00:43:05.000
But I feel like we have a package that the house is is it's already going to be hard for me to sell one and done to the house they've agreed to no pr for for third arrest on class b misdemeanors and i'll say it again there are serious crimes that are classified as class b misdemeanors including driving while intoxicated so it just is what it is and understand we just this this was last maybe one or two ago.

585
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.500
It was an issue out of Raymond, New Hampshire.

586
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:16.500
There was someone who had five drunk driving arrests in a two-month time period.

587
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.500
So that is something that we're dealing with.

588
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.500
And the issue is how does that happen?

589
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:33.500
They're getting bail and going out again, getting bail, getting released, arrested again in a two-month time period.

590
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.000
I'm not sure about the convictions on all those.

591
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
This is not abolishing PR bail.

592
00:43:41.000 --> 00:44:04.000
You can still get PR bail, but if you are out and released on PR bail and you violate the conditions of your release the third time, and I understand that the fruit analogy that, but if you keep getting arrested and violate, what's the concept?

593
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
What is the consequence of that?

594
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
If of that?

595
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Why have conditions of your release in the first place?

596
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.500
Why have you been arrested?

597
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:28.500
Well, I'm just saying if you violate the conditions and you set these, one of them is don't get arrested for any more crimes.

598
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.000
You keep getting arrested for more crimes.

599
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Yes, they're not offenses you may go to jail for.

600
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:50.500
and it's not this provision, even if I don't feel strongly about it, I'm trying to get this to the floor for a debate in the House.

601
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.500
I have not been able to do it.

602
00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:06.500
I'm praying that you guys allow me to do it today or do it next week because that's really what I want to do.

603
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.500
Can we take a two-minute break?

604
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.500
If I could before we take a break.

605
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.500
My sticking point is it's the third time.

606
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:23.500
This shows such an utter disrespect for the law in law enforcement.

607
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.000
I mean, one time, okay.

608
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
The third time while you're on bail, that's all we're asking for.

609
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
PR bail stays.

610
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000
But if you get arrested three times, it shows no respect for the system of justice.

611
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:50.000
We have 13 minutes to get this done, so please let them take their two-minute break.

612
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Thank you.

613
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Thank you.

614
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Thank you.

615
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Thank you.

616
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Thank you.

617
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Thank you.

618
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Thank you.

619
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Thank you.

620
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Good afternoon.

621
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.500
We now reconvene the committee of conference on House Bill 1476.

622
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:22.000
My understanding is May will be returned back to Shell, but we would strike the PR language.

623
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:34.500
And if you commit the three offenses, you will be brought before a judge similar draft as the Senate position on the violent crimes section.

624
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.500
We all in agreement with that?

625
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500
Yes.

626
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.500
I don't even have a copy of this.

627
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.000
That's almost a time crunch.

628
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
I know there was two shells in there.

629
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I mean, two Mays.

630
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
We have the Senate attorney also answer some questions, Mr.

631
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Chair.

632
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Thank you.

633
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
We have the Senate attorney also answer some questions, Mr.

634
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Chair.

635
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
You might want to give him that copy.

636
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
It is 255.

637
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I can talk fast.

638
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:32.500
I think the question is whether or not it's permissible to have a statute that precludes an indigent person from being bailed when a person who has access to funds can be bailed.

639
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:43.000
And I think that the answer to that question is that you can't do it in a categorical way like that.

640
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.500
You have to maintain an opportunity for an indigent person to receive bail.

641
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.500
My understanding of what you're all saying doesn't do that.

642
00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:15.500
It just effectively denies a third-time offender access to a bail commissioner just whether that person is indigent or whether that person has money and says that the only person who's going to bail that person is going to be a judge.

643
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.500
That's correct.

644
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.000
And how do we write that to reflect that?

645
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Because I see everybody shaking or nodding their hand it's already written the senate position when i helped right that's what that provision as written it what it would do you just want to put that the policy of what is the house position but you take the procedures the procedural side merge it in and that's it.

646
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:01.500
But how does, is the language in the amendment that, and Rick has my copy of it, does it do that?

647
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.500
Lines 21 and 22.

648
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:12.000
And what I'm looking at say, the court shall not order personal recognizance bail in such cases.

649
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.500
Is it the intent to strike that?

650
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.500
Yes.

651
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.500
Yes.

652
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.500
Yes.

653
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.000
Do we need to add that language?

654
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
No.

655
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:35.500
No, we just have to change May to shall and strike out the line about PR bail.

656
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.500
May to shall in line 9?

657
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.000
And I believe it's 17.

658
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
I'm going off the top of my head.

659
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
It's not 17.

660
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
There's two of them.

661
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
No, that was the notwithstanding paragraph 3 section.

662
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
That's long gone.

663
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.500
Yeah, that's not in here.

664
00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.500
We're just talking about number 9, line 9.

665
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.500
258, everyone.

666
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.500
All right.

667
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.500
That's it.

668
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.500
That's 258.

669
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.500
Made a shell.

670
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.000
Strike 21 and 22, the back half.

671
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Good job.

672
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
401.

673
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Yes.

674
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Yes.

675
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
I appreciate it.

676
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Bill, did they talk to hear about 1431.

677
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Yes, I'm going to send it.

678
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Yes.

679
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
It's Bill, number one.

680
00:50:36.000 --> 00:51:02.000
it is 1476 it's 259 so i'm i you know i'm not the official timekeeper well you don't have to worry about because your deadline's four ours is three i'm worried about senator morris is sitting right here If the Senate is not worried about its own deadlines, then we're all set.

681
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
I won't tell if you don't.

682
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
*** We're just checking.

683
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.500
It should be good, Darrell.

684
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:14.500
I want to make sure that everybody needs to be.

685
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.500
Yes, you did.

686
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.500
You got to pass it, though.

687
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.000
Yeah, I know you did.

688
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.500
Isn't there a rail trail?

689
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.500
Thank you.

690
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.500
Back from our break, reopening the committee conference on 1476.

691
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:37.500
It's going to be, Representative Berry is going to file the amendment.

692
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.000
I will accompany with him to make sure it's a report.

693
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Thank you.

694
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
It's going to be written very similar to the procedure on the Senate position.

695
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.500
So it's going to say if you...

696
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.000
I don't have a draft.

697
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.500
I'm literally operating off of no draft.

698
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500
So...

699
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.000
operating off of no draft.

700
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
So.

701
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:31.500
Going off of memory here, but in what was one time Senate bill 294, if you would scroll down after the violent crime section, there was another section if you kept defaulting in hearings, and there was another section if you kept getting arrested out on bail.

702
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:39.500
That's a different section, but the language in there had to do with committing certain offenses.

703
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.500
That's how you would want to write that.

704
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.500
Then you want to take the procedural side of this.

705
00:52:48.500 --> 00:53:04.500
If you commit any of these offenses, after the third time, a person will be detained pending a bail hearing before a judge for 24 or 36 hours, depending on that language.

706
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.000
That's how it would flow.

707
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Thank you.

708
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
And, of course, strike the PR bill restriction.

709
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Thank you.

710
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Thank you.

711
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Thank you.

712
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.500
So, if you look at page two, I'm going to go.

713
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:40.500
So if you look at page 2, line 1, where it says, shall not be brought before a bail commissioner, and shall upon arrest be detained pending an arraignment before the court.

714
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.500
You've got to take that language and implement that into...

715
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:52.000
You see where it says on page one, line nine, where it's shall.

716
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
So you got to take that language and put it in there.

717
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
So it's saying the same thing.

718
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Because when you say detained, that can mean a lot of things.

719
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
and I think that's part of the misinterpretation people have.

720
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Detained waiting trial, detained waiting what...

721
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.500
It's detained pending your arraignment.

722
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.000
I just want that one.

723
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Thank you.

724
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
If I may, Mr.

725
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Chair, just one other thing just to make more clear.

726
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:48.000
line nine line nine, the issue that I had with the comma, we had changed that to, you go to line eight or an insert third or subsequent offense for a person charged with a class B misdemeanor.

727
00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:07.500
I think makes it clearer no i want to move third or subsequent defense before a person charged with a class b misdemeanor So it's or third or subsequent offense for a person charged with a class B misdemeanor.

728
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:15.500
So it's or third or subsequent offense for a person charged with a class B misdemeanor.

729
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:26.000
Because otherwise, tell me why it's not just class B misdemeanor and then third or subsequent offense the way it's drafted.

730
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I think you can take out the class B misdemeanor altogether and just say third or subsequent offense Because now you're including all offenses.

731
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Am I correct?

732
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Okay, then I'm going to maybe step back if we're doing that.

733
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
This is...

734
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
That's not a change.

735
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
No, class B misdemeanor was the position of the house.

736
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
That was your focus was Class B misdemeanors.

737
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
No.

738
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:10.000
If it just says third and subsequent offenses, it would cover a Class A misdemeanor, Class B misdemeanor.

739
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
No, I understand that.

740
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
And all felonies.

741
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
But why would you walk away?

742
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.500
Because you want to keep the Class B misdemeanors in there.

743
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:28.000
That's just walking away to walk away, if you ask me.

744
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.500
It's not changing the substance of how this is being applied.

745
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:40.500
Well, it is changing it because right now it's limited to class B misdemeanors.

746
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.500
Can we hear it from us?

747
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.500
Of course.

748
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:51.000
If you just have it be an offense, it includes violations.

749
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And I think that's what Senator Soucy's's concern is she doesn't want it to go down to violation level you could have just be misdemeanor and then it would apply to aid misdemeanors be misdemeanors whatever um but i don't think the i don't think the intent was to have this apply to every three violations.

750
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Violations of parking tickets.

751
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
You can't use the word 10.

752
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
All right, I understand.

753
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:35.500
So if you could do or, third or subsequent offense for a person charged with a Class B misdemeanor.

754
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.500
That keeps the language that was in the house first.

755
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:47.000
It just moves one phrase ahead of the other, so it modifies it.

756
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.500
You can see the misdemeanor.

757
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:54.500
That keeps the language that was in the House version.

758
00:57:54.500 --> 00:58:01.000
It just moves one phrase ahead of the other, so it modifies it.

759
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:16.000
You could do it that way, or you could do it a person charged with a Class B misdemeanor having three times previously been charged with a misdemeanor or felony.

760
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:25.500
Because there's no, you mentioned this in an earlier bill, there's no subsequent offenses for most of these things.

761
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.500
That's not a crime.

762
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.500
It's, you're talking about somebody's record.

763
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:36.000
You're not talking about like DWI second offenses, its own offense.

764
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
I understood.

765
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
which are we going to do what Mr.

766
00:58:42.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Lehman just suggested which is clear i think yes can we um somebody write i'll talk yeah we'll we'll write and you talk a person charged with a misdemeanor Class B misdemeanor who has three times previously been charged, arrested or charged?

767
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Do you want it to apply to arrest or do you want it to apply to direct summonses?

768
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Three times previously been charged with a misdemeanor.

769
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Wait a minute.

770
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
A person charged with a class B misdemeanor.

771
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Who has three times previously been charged with a misdemeanor or felony.

772
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Shall be detained for a period of not more than 24 hours after the arrest and then as it's written there after the arrest, and then as it's written there.

773
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
It's the charges.

774
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Yes, but that would go, I believe that what the attorney said captured that.

775
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.500
I don't think it was word for word, but he was kind of explaining it.

776
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
Can I read this?

777
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Yes.

778
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:32.000
Okay, so on line 8, we're going to substitute in for the language on line 8 after the struck through May, or a person charged with a Class B misdemeanor who has three times previously been charged with a misdemeanor or felony shall be detained for a period of not more than 24 hours after the arrest.

779
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Saturday, Sundays, legal holidays.

780
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Right.

781
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.500
I didn't read that, but I'm assuming.

782
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.000
And then we would strike.

783
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.500
The court shall not order PR bail on such cases on line 21 and 22.

784
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
Is that correct?

785
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500
I have two.

786
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
I apologize, Senator.

787
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.000
I have two people talking to me.

788
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.500
My understanding is that it would technically be a fourth arrest.

789
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:15.000
So I think what you're saying, you believe that this is now your third arrest, so it should be two prior.

790
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Two prior.

791
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:51.500
We can't go to fourth arrest come on well it's in the matter of but you've had third or subsequent we're trying to mirror the language of the house position yeah i think he has to the language of this I believe the way it should be written is a person charged with a class B misdemeanor who has two times previously been charged with a misdemeanor or felony.

792
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.000
That makes it your third.

793
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yes.

794
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
If anybody wants to stand for the fourth of us, John helps.

795
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.500
Two times previously been charged.

796
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.500
The misdemeanor performance shall be detained for a few weeks.

797
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.000
Deleting the sentence on 21 and 22.

798
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And there are no other changes.

799
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I believe that satisfies what the House is willing to agree to.

800
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Are we okay?

801
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We'll be fine.

802
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Okay.

803
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Senate's okay.

804
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Everyone okay here?

805
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yep.

806
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.500
I believe the way it works is you have to file the report.

807
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.000
And I'll come with you.

808
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I'll bring Mr.

809
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Lehman with us.

810
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.500
We can all walk over there together.

811
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.000
We can even link arms.

812
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
All right, well, this is awesome.

813
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.500
Thank you guys very much.

814
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500
Thank you.

815
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm glad we got this word out.

816
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.500
Many thanks to Senator Morris for stopping the clock for a few minutes.

817
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500
Thank you, Chuck.

818
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.500
I heard he could stop time.

819
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
I didn't believe it.

820
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
He did it.

821
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.000
Morris for stopping the clock for a few minutes.

822
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Thank you.

823
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Thank you.

824
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Thank you.

825
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Thank you.

826
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Thank you.

827
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Thank you.

828
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Thank you.

829
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thank you.

830
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Thank you.

831
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Thank you.

832
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Thank you.

833
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Thank you.

834
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Thank you.

835
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Thank you.

836
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Thank you.

837
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Thank you.

838
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Thank you.

839
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Thank you.

840
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Thank you.

841
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Thank you.

842
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Thank you.

843
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Thank you.

844
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Thank you.

845
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Thank you.

846
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Thank you.

847
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Thank you.

848
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Thank you.

849
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Thank you.

850
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Thank you.

851
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Thank you.

852
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Thank you.

853
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Thank you.

854
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Thank you.

855
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Thank you.

856
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Thank you.

857
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Thank you.

858
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Thank you.

859
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Thank you.

860
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Thank you.

861
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Thank you.
