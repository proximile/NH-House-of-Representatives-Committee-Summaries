uh HB
 
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
1088 um for me this is kind of a sad day
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
I was brought up in Toronto my
 
00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
grandparents all went to the University
 
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
of Buffalo I was born in Niger Falls New
 
00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
York and the bills got beat and you know
 
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
so and in in the last few seconds on a
 
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
field goal miss field goal miss to the
 
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
right I just couldn't believe it but so
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
how did you get yourself to be able to
 
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
come here
 
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
today well it's been a it's been a
 
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
tragedy all along Green Green Bay got
 
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
beat too so I lost out on that one and
 
00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
although although we all to be watching
 
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
Detroit they're a strong powerful little
 
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
team there so with young people so
 
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully yes so um getting off of that
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
I I would like to mention to everybody
 
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee here be aware we are
 
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
going to be starting to schedule uh
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and I have executive
 
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
sessions SCH scheduled for the 30th and
 
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be starting somewhere around midm
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
morning and you're going to see a a
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
whole load of bills on there we won't be
 
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
able to exec them all that day but they
 
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
will continue to the next day so there
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
there will be at the bottom of the on
 
00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
the 30th bills not exact on the on the
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
30th will continue to the next executive
 
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
session which will be the next day uh so
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you only see one bill on the next day
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the calendar that's because all that
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
other stuff we didn't do on the previous
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
day will be in that calendar it just
 
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
saves our clerk down the hallway from
 
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
having to put all the stuff into both
 
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
both calendars this has been done many
 
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
many times before it's a practice so so
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
be looking
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
31st uh I haven't set that yet I haven't
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
set that
 
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
yet and so so in in when we're executing
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
we usually put some time in the front
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
side those for
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
caucuses um and we'll probably have that
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
occur then as well so um so with that
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go on to
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
1088 1088 is a bill enabling schools to
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
main a supply EP
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
EP nephrine Auto injectors and I'd like
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
to uh recognize representa Nelson to
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
to the committee my name is jod Nelson
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham 13 and Derry and
 
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is my very first bill so it's
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
exciting day for me here um and I am
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
here um regarding uh my bill uh it which
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
is regarding the stocking of emergency
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
epinephrine injectors in school let me
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of background to
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
let you know why this is so important to
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
me uh when my son was two I nearly
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
killed him by giving him his first
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
peanut butter cracker and I learned how
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
quickly and potentially deadly an
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic allergy reaction really can
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
be according to the CDC food allergies
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
are a growing food safety and public
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
health concern that affect an estimated
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
8% of children in the United States
 
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's one in 13 children and um an
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
average classroom that's most likely at
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
least two children in each classroom who
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
have such a severe
 
00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
allergy we now have kindergarteners
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
coming into school for a full day which
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
is great um but they may be introduced
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
to new foods during school lunch that
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
they've never tried before and may have
 
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
a reaction to we may have visitors to uh
 
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
the school who are exposed to a food
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
allergen or may have a beasting they
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
might not have ever known theyve been
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
allergic and H and will have an EP will
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
possibly have an anaphylactic reaction
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
my school nurse Lori Fleming from Hood
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
Middle School actually saved a child's
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
life by utilizing a stock epinephrine
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
auto injector he had a known penut
 
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
allergy and did not have a personal
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
supply of epinephrine auto injector in
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
school so this another reason why it's
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
important to have a stock
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
supply there is language in the
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical section of our rsas
 
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
pertaining to
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
epinephrine auto injector use but
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's no clear language in our
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
education section of the rsas the
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to provide clear
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
language and uniform procedure for all
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
public schools to have a stock of
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
emergency use epinephrine pens this is
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
important for school administration
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
School nurses and also parents to be
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
able to navigate quickly to our
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
education laws and be clear on what is
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
the current law this language is
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
identical to the language that is
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
already in statute regarding emergency
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
use of asthma inhalers and the stocking
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
of those asthma inhalers and the
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
language is clear and the process is
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
running smoothly within our schools
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
presently our schools are allowed to
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
contract with drug manifacturers for
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
free epinephrine Auto injectors however
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
if a time comes when the program no
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
longer exists this bill allows for Don
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
ations to cover the cost of the stock
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
Auto injectors therefor therefore
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
providing a way to obtain them without
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
cost to taxpayers I have the full
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
support of the New Hampshire school
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
nurse Association and I know that Morgan
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
is here from convenient MD to speak on
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
how this bill will fix a glitch in
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
schools being able to utilize convenient
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
injectors thank you for your time and I
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%

questions I'm hoping you can you know
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
the process a little bit just to help
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
determine appropriateness under current
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
uh rules and law who is allowed to
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
administer these epip pin at school is
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
it just a nurse or is it anybody can
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
administer um Sor sorry moving this a
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
um it is the nurse and also um teachers
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
and school administrators are trained on
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
um on administering that and um they are
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
um by law
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
um what's the word I'm trying to think
 
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.670 align:start position:0%
um what's the word I'm trying to think
of

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
um yes if I may a follow up on that one
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
um so I notic didn't specify uh in the
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
bill are we talking about stalking adult
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
dose epinephrine Auto injectors child
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
dose Auto injectors or both um that
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be up to the discretion of the
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
school nurse um I know personally for me
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
my son um is a big kid so uh early on he
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
um switched from EpiPen Juniors which is
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
the lower dose to EpiPen
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
um for the adult use um I think it's 50
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
and over which is um the adult usage um
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
I know it doesn't specifically state in
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
this and if it would be more clear and
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to the committee I would be glad
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
to amend that to include that in the
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
Bill thank Youk you repr
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative um you're hearing from
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
the EMTs this morning that's why we're
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
asking these questions I'm on the rescue
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
squad which may or may not be actually
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
on scene when the school nurse might not
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
be there and our requirement is that we
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
um match the person to the prescription
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
and since this is a generic prescription
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
I want to figure out if this will work
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
in our protocol in the EMT protocol
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
that's correct I don't know that but I
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
can certainly find out and if it would
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
be helpful for you for me to amend that
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
to allow that to happen I know um when I
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
spoke to our school nurse about how um
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
this usually happens um it the
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
um General protocol is that the epip pen
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry that's that's not the
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
generic use the epinephrine pen um is uh
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
delivered immediately and then 911 is
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
called um and
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
I literally copied uh I had OS copy the
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
exact language that's included right now
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
in law um for uh stocking and and use of
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
emergency asthma inhalers so I um just
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
had them um replace emergency asthma
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
inhalers with epinephrine pens um so I
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if um emergency use of asthma
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
inhalers um at this time is okay with um
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
the protocol of EMTs or not I it's a
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
different ball game basically okay okay
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
representa Damon you had your hand up
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
my question thank you um and let me
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
first say it's wonderful that youve
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward thank you um
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired dietitian I worked some in
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
food allergies and epipens are so
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
critical and they're expensive people
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
don't always have what they need so I
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
have two questions one is whether
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's any statement in regards to
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the expiration date
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
because since we don't know how much the
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
school supply would be utilized and we
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
know they do expire I think there needs
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
to be some address to that and the other
 
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
to be some address to that and the other
question

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
is whether you have
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
considered some language around
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
not not only coordinating with one
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
for-profit entity convenience an MD
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
including that but whether schools could
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh have a way to do this besides through
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
one entity that's not in oh I'm sorry
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's not
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
included in the language of the bill I
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
just have a representative here who is
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
explaining um why this is important for
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
um the pro current
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
process they uh I think he can speak
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
further to it but I don't believe that
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
um is the only way to obtain a free um
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
EP through the
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
companies thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so this is
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
permissive language it's May it allows a
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
school and I'm just wondering if you had
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
considered at all because of the
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
severity of the problem as you're
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
describing it um had you considered um
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
requiring like why did you choose for it
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
to be like allowing rather than some
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
some people might think that requiring
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
this would be a good idea just your
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that thank you for your
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
question I agree with you I thought that
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
it might be problematic in the sense
 
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
it might be problematic in the sense
that

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
if there was ever an occasion where the
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
free um program would not be available
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
then would it be an unfunded
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
mandate thank you further questions yes
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you uh
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
I was a teacher of physical education
 
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
and so beasting were a big thing for me
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and at the time of course I taught in
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
the Dark Ages but at the time uh we were
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the same protocol as the EMTs that if
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the EpiPen did not have the students
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
name on it then we weren't technically
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to give it to us and and I know
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
the nurse and I struggled because we
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
were like 10 minutes away from an
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
ambulance showing up or an EMT showing
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
up uh whether we would put our licenses
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
on the line to save a kid because it's
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
so critical and we did have uh over my
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
years of teaching several instances
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
where the EpiPen saved a life so I'm
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
very happy you brought this bill forward
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
I think it just needs clarification not
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
only for the EMTs but for the uh
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
teachers who are trained I was a first
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
responder so um I was trained in its use
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
um but even at that at that time I
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't give it uh and I worked at a
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
high school where we constantly told the
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
kids to bring in their epens and
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
constantly they forgot or didn't want to
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
so um I think you know uh an amendment
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
like that I'd be willing to to work with
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative dry if you want to and um
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
to the bill and see if we can put that
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
in thank you further questions yes
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing us forward
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
and taking my question so I also as an
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
educator 40 years got trained in this
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
using oranges and whatever and I prayed
 
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
I would never have to use my and I
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
didn't thank god um but my question is
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
is there any danger in giving a person
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
using this on someone who that didn't
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
I have never heard of a danger in um I'm
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
not I'm not a medical person or provider
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
in my research I never have read that um
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
um complications that occurred with
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who um are you talking about
 
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.870 align:start position:0%
somebody who um are you talking about
like

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
accidentally if I I'm thinking the kids
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
having an allergy but maybe they're not
 
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
and like you know if the child has its
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
own pen then it's probably pretty safe
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
but let's say you got a kid and let's
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
say I've got one of these that doesn't
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
have a name attached to it and I'm
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
thinking there's a food allergy issue
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
but there isn't and I you know use the
 
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
but there isn't and I you know use the
pen

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
pen
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
on a person that that's not really what
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
the problem was well curious again I'm
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
not a medical professional but I have
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
not um heard of that or read of that I
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
have actually spoken and know friends of
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
mine who in um trying to give their
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
administer this to their child they
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
accidentally poke their finger and um
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're fine
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
so further questions from the committee
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
yes represent Bel thank you and that was
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
an excellent question and I'd like to
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
follow up just a little bit on that um
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find many people who
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
like opado injectors more than me um in
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
my time as a paramedic I used f a lot
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I personally had my own life saved
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
by it but at the same time going back to
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
the last question we heard um when we're
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
talking about administering to a student
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
who is not a known allergy so they
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
you're connecting uh the prescription to
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
a known allergy you are introducing a
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
bit of sort of Diagnostics into this
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
process and there is
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
there're so these are not nonzero risk
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
so if they're administered incorrectly
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
if you happen to hit the artery there's
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
a good chance of arteriospasm you risk
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
possibly even losing the limb if you
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
introduce it to a vein or an artery you
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
get a big shot of Epi straight to your
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
heart if there's an unknown heart thing
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
going on at some history there that
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
isn't known or perhaps is known you risk
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
um entering into an arhythmia possibly
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest so is there knowing that
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
is there concern con ER with people who
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
were not trained in Diagnostics a nurse
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
would certainly be trained in this but
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned about just teachers
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
possibly introducing this uh
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily thank you for your
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
question this is already in statute um
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
in the pharmaceutical section this is
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
already happening in the schools so um I
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
don't uh know that
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't I I mean I think that it's
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a not a pro I don't know I don't
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
know how to answer your question exactly
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
other than it's in statute and it's
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
already in practice and I have not heard
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
of any uh complications with that I I oh
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you uh Morgan
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you uh Morgan
frostino

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
today yeah thank
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
you um thank you everyone for taking the
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
time to uh listen to my um input on this
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill um uh so I'm from can you just yeah
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself oh y my name is
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
Morgan I'm from uh convenient MD uh we
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
are a Healthcare Company we're based in
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh Portsmith we have uh 14 location
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
urgent care locations throughout the
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
state as well as a primary care Care
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
office um and one of the ways that we
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
try to give back to our communities is
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
through our school owners partnership
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
program uh through this program one of
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the free resources that we provide to
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
schools is we help them obtain um stock
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
medications um a very uh common request
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
from schools is um for help utilizing
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
the E pen for schools program this is a
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
national program uh that donates two um
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
twin packs of EB pens per School uh per
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
calendar year um and so we uh we help
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
these schools by uh writing the
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
prescription which is required to obtain
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
the devices uh we place the order and
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
then uh currently the way uh that the
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
law is written in New Hampshire uh it
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
must um in conjunction with the policy
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh the facilitator of the program
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
it must come to the uh prescriber uh to
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
then dispense to the school um and so uh
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
it that creates um some inefficiency um
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
or let me back up um I had looked looked
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
into why this might be the case in New
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um because uh we also have
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
clinics in Maine and Massachusetts and I
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
learned that Most states in the country
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
um the epipens go directly to the
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
schools but the way after inquiring with
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy I submitted a
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
request for declaratory ruling
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
essentially what they informed me was
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
the way the current law is written is
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
that um because the this facilitator is
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
licensed as a wholesaler wholesalers are
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
only permitted to sell directly to
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
schools it does not have any it it the
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
language is specific in that it only
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
permits the sale and because these
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
epipens are being donated to the schools
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
um it it would prohibit the school from
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
working directly with the facilitator of
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the program um byid Pharma um I and I
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
did uh I I know I'm getting ahead of
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
myself I uh there should be copies of
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
the uh summary on in front of all of you
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
if if you want to follow along um uh so
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
essentially um what this would do is um
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
this would make it easier for schol
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
schools to obtain the epipens because it
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
could get shipped directly to the school
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
um currently when it gets shipped to the
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
clinic it requires that our Clinic staff
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
receive and manage and communicate to
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
the school nurse when the epipens are
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
there um you know occasionally things
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
get misplaced and sometimes there's a
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of panic because as we uh as
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed earlier epipens are very
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
expensive and so um these are donated
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
EpiPen so I mean we always you know we
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
always manage to to uh to get the
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
devices to the school nurse but um so so
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's one one issue that may come up um
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
another issue is uh these School nurses
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
are usually um obtaining the devices on
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
their personal time driving sometimes uh
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
depending on where the school nurse is
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
and where they have a willing prescriber
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
it can be well over an hour round trip
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um on a weekend or after school things
 
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
um on a weekend or after school things
like

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
that um and
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
um and it may may a uh increase uh
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
potentially the availability of um
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
schools who can utilize this program
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
because a if if a um if a ordering
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
provider all I have to do is write a
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
prescription they may be more amendable
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
to uh assisting the school and Ting the
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
devices as opposed to writing the
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
prescription and receiving the shipment
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
and managing it and communicating to the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
school nurse that they've arrived and
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
asking them to come pick it up um so
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
essentially um this uh the language in
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would um uh make it clear that
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
School nurses could work directly with a
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
third party that is looking to provide
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
the epipens at uh no cost
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
um to the
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
school thank you very much are there
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Penton now thank
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
question um from the prescriber
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
perspective what is the risk to the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
prescriber because I notice in your
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
testimony you say um it would increase
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
the availability of stock epipens and
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
mean more willing prescribers um for
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
this purpose so yeah so I'm just simp
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
meant that they wouldn't have to receive
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
the devices to their location and hold
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
on to them for the school nurse to come
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
pick up um because this program if this
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the uh the EpiPen for
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
schools program instead of shipping to
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
the prescriber to the end dispense of
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
the school would be able to ship
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
directly to the school as they do in in
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
states I guess my question is more
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
related to like malpractice risk to the
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
prescriber so if you write a
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
prescription for a blanket prescription
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
for the epen to be used used does that
 
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.830 align:start position:0%
for the epen to be used used does that
ever

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
ever
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
um in turn effect if they're used
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriately can the prescriber ever
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
be litigated for malpractice I'm not
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure what the what the logistics are
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
they are were the concerns
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll just leave it at that I
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much representative
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony on this um just
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify this program is it's not
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
specifically your program as convenient
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
MD but it's it's a program that you're
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
helping to assist with and that they're
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
donated not from Community MD but the
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer correct y it is a national
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
program tens of thousands of uh schools
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh every year utilize this program
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
excellent and if I may have a quick
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on that just to um clarify so
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
these are donated by the manufacturer
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
but do the participating um
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
organizations such as yours receive any
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
compensation as a part of participating
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
in this program we do not receive
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
anything excellent thank you
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
y further questions yes represent
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to clarify so
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
your program is with the Branded epipens
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
not generic no um we we our our program
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
our school nurse partnership program is
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
we help School nurses with a variety of
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
things for for free it's just a way to
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
build Goodwill and give back to the
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
community and pro promote Health if a
 
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
school nurse requests our our help in
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
utilizing this National program this
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
National EpiPen for schools program
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's the school nurse making the
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
request to obtain the EpiPen and we
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
simply help them obtain it by writing
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
the prescription receiving the delivery
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.230 align:start position:0%
of the
devices

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
devices
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
oh so do you have uh
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
capacity to help School nurses get
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
generic ones as opposed to Brandon
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely we could certainly write it
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
for description it would just require
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
them to obtain them some other way
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether that would be trying to obtain
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
them from a pharmacy or an online vendor
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
or something like that um we we
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
certainly could it's just that because
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
this is the free donation program this
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
is the Lion Share of the requests for
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
epinephrine devices that we get thank
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
you represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
can you shed any light on helping others
 
00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.549 align:start position:0%
can you shed any light on helping others
the

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
the people other than the school nurse
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
who might be able in a position to give
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
this uh shot to match the prescription
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the patient um we my understanding is
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
that the bo the Board of Pharmacy uh has
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh said that this these should be
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
written in the name of a school for
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
emergency use um so I unfortunately I
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what the specifics are in
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the training for uh
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers okay thank
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah any further
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
I do not have any other pink cards for
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
this bill 1088 so I'm closing the
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and we will in a couple minutes
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
go into the next
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
1553

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have any I think they went that
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
way if you find any I'd like a personal
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
problem

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
 
draw

00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.230 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
usually really breakf I have to do
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
this okay it is 9:30 we're ready to go
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
ahead with the next hearing the next
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is on HP
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
1553 this is relative to establishing a
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
pilot program under the Department of
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
Education to offer spelling to
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
communicate services to students with
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
autism and
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
aasia um so uh with that I'd like to
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor Bill uh
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative Jim
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
education thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
uh for hearing my testimony on this bill
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jim kofalt I
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Wilton Temple and
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
new ipswitch Hillsboro County District
 
00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.110 align:start position:0%
new ipswitch Hillsboro County District
32

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
32
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to begin by just
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
introducing what spelling to communicate
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
is um it's a methodology that has been
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
developed that teaches people with
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
Autism and
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
araxia how to spell uh by Point how to
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
spell out words by pointing to letters
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
on a letter board um aaia is a condition
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
in which somebody cannot speak or cannot
 
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.830 align:start position:0%
in which somebody cannot speak or cannot
speak

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
reliably and one of the founding um
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
assumptions of spelling to communicate
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
is that this is essentially a motor
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
skills deficit not a cognitive deficit
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
and so um there is also an assumption
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
that every person person is um with
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
autism is is fully as intelligent as
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else unless uh unless proven
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise so I want you to imagine for a
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
moment that you have never been able to
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
talk that you are fully aware of
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on in the world
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
you understand language just as well as
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
person um you have complex thoughts and
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
emotions but you have never been able to
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
express those reliably
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
what would that be
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
like there are tablet devices
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
applications various kinds of tools that
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
help people with Autism to be able to
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
communicate simple things what they want
 
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.750 align:start position:0%
communicate simple things what they want
for

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
dinner if they need to go to the
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
bathroom um what they'd like to do
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
today but there's really nothing uh in
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
those in those tools that enable
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
the other challenge I think that a lot
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
of people with Autism run into is um
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
because they have a a specific neurology
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
they often are not inclined to make eye
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
contact so people make this assumption
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
that they're sort of off in their own
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
world consequently a lot of people look
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
at people with Autism and they think
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
that there's a a cognitive deficiency
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
when in fact that turns out not to be
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
true at
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
all now I want you to imagine what it
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
would be like if you've lived your
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
entire life that way and suddenly you
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
break out of that
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
prison what would that be
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
like uh there's a young man named
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
Gregory Tino who is a blogger who who
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
described his experience this
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
way um the year I started to live was
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
2017 the month was May the time was the
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
moment I learned to spell on the letter
 
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.789 align:start position:0%
moment I learned to spell on the letter
board

00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
my world turned upside down in that
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
moment never again would people think I
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
was stupid or had the mind of a
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
toddler the look on my mom's face is
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
forever burned in my
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
memory I would love to relive that again
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
and again this is the best moment of my
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
life so
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
far there are no words to describe the
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
depths of my
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
lottery like winning the lottery that
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
you've always dreamed
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
of I first found out about spelling to
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
communicate a little over a year ago
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
when a friend of mine um shared news
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
about her daughter and she said Jim
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
Miracles are happening um I think you're
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to hear from her today and so um I
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
will will let her tell her own
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
story this bill would create a modest
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
pilot program available through our
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
schools uh and if passed it could
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
potentially make New Hampshire the first
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
state in the country to implement
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
spelling to communicate or to make it
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
available uh through our
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
schools I would like to point out a few
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
arguments I think that you're likely to
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
hear um in opposition to the
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
bill um the first has to do with
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
something called facilitated
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
communication there was a methodology
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
some years ago called facilitated
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
communication that was
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
discredited and this is not facilitated
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
communication nevertheless the the
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
criticism uh that that some make against
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
spell spelling to communicate is that
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
the instructor may lead the speller to
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain letters so that the
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
communication really isn't coming from
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
the client at all it's coming from the
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
teacher or the
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
instructor in 20 20 there was a study
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
published in nature in the journal
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
Nature that actually used itracking
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
devices and they were able to um
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
positively discern that that in fact
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
people's eyes were going to the letters
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
before their their hand was going to the
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
letter so um so there is scientific
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
evidence that this is not facilitated
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
communication furthermore there are
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
numerous people who have actually
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
graduated from the letter board to a
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
keyboard there is no facilitator and
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
they are communicating complex thoughts
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
um that includes some people uh who
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
write who write blogs uh several
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
non-speakers who write blogs um whom I
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
will mention in a moment so I think the
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the notion that this is
 
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
facilitated communication or similar to
 
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
facilitated communication uh is quite
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
easy to
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
debunk the second criticism is that
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
there are no um long-term expansive
 
00:35:56.319 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
there are no um long-term expansive
studies

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh proving that spelling to communicate
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
is effective in fact there are quite a
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
few studies um in process uh I think
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
that the researchers are catching up to
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
uh the reality of the experience that
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
people out there in the world are having
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
um in order to do an expansive study you
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
would need an expansive population of
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
people who've been through this program
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
and I would assert that uh New Hampshire
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
could potentially be uh on the Leading
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
Edge of that research uh but the bottom
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
line is that if you hear from the
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
families of people who have been through
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
this and whose lives have been changed
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
by this I believe that you'll come to
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion I did uh which is
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
that we should be making this available
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
now and uh letting people Avail
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
themselves of
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
it people like Gregory Tino whom I
 
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.470 align:start position:0%
it people like Gregory Tino whom I
mentioned

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
before um he laments the fact that
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
people once thought he had the intellect
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a toddler he has by the way published
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
four books now on Amazon and he writes a
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
Blog uh Vincent renella is another
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
prominent blogger non-speaker he has a
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
strong interest in politics and he
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
aspires to be the first non-speaker
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
elected to the United States
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Elizabeth Bonker has never spoken
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
but she learned to communicate using a
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
letter board and now a tablet device in
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
2022 she graduated as the valid
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
dictorian of Rollins College and was
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
featured in People magazine she's also
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
the founder of communication for all a
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization whose mission is
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all non-speakers with
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
autism have access to communication and
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
education Jamie Handley who did not
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
communicate prior to the age of 19
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
verbally co-authored a book with his
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
father and a handful of other
 
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.390 align:start position:0%
father and a handful of other
non-speaking

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
non-speaking
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
friends and that book became the basis
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
for the award-winning document mentary
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
spellers which I strongly encourage all
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
of you to check
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
out there are many other stories I think
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
you will hear a few of them
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
today um I want to strongly encourage
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
you to to pass this bill I I um I do
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
want to mention that this was drafted
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
very very late in the process in fact I
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
submitted the LSR and it was not on the
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
list of lsrs so it fell through the
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
cracks um I I reached out out to OS and
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh and they corrected that but it was
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
among the last of the bills to to be
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
drafted so um I will acknowledge that um
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
some may see fit to to make some
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
amendments to the bill I would be very
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
happy to work with anybody on this
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
committee who is interested in doing
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
specifically um I have heard some people
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
question whether or not the acceptance
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
of a grant would be optional to a school
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
District I am entirely open to making an
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
acceptance of a grant optional to the
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
school district um if that is something
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
that people would like to see um changed
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the bill um that concludes my
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
introduction and I will take questions
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
there questions represent dry then
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you Mr
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
question can you describe the process a
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
little bit is this something that we're
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
paying for a person specially trained to
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
come and work in the school and are they
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
one-on-one um you know distributed
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
oneon-one with the students um it is a
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
one-on-one process and again there are
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
people here who can probably describe it
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
in in further detail um it takes some
 
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.030 align:start position:0%
in in further detail um it takes some
time

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
for uh for someone to let's say come up
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
to speed or open up as they as they
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
describe it um so there's a very
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
specific methodology around sort of
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
getting them from you know from from
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
zero to to 30 and then eventually moving
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
on from there it's also a lot of hard
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
work um you know I've seen people
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
spellers who are answering Q&amp;A sessions
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it can be a fairly exhausting
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
process um so it's it's it's a long
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
process and I I believe there are also
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
videos out there quite a few videos out
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
on YouTube um some of which I think
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
people in this room will probably share
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
with the committee as well um that can
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
enable you to actually see what that
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
process looks
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
like well let's Okay quickly follow up
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
because then I want to get to the
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's a number of cards questions we
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
have here practitioner would stay with
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
that student so every school would have
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
to have a different person no um thank
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
you the idea would be that um because
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
there are a few practitioners in New
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I'm aware of there are
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
some in surrounding states as well um
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
generally the the activity could take
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
place at school at a school or or really
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere else um but no it would not be
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
that that person would not be a sort of
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
Resident at the at the school thank
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
represent cascaden thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question has
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
this program been vetted by the American
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
speech language hearing
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
Association um the American speech
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
language hearing Association um is
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh It generally is opposed to spelling
 
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.109 align:start position:0%
uh It generally is opposed to spelling
to

00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
communicate because they they raise the
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
concern of facilitated
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
communication um again I believe that
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
that concern is easily debunked um and I
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
would also underscore that this program
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
would not take away from any other
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
program out there uh this would be a net
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
new money it's a very modest start it's
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
a pilot program um and if you read the
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
the the very end of the bill it as a
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
pilot program it it is repealed
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
automatically after after three
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
years representative Mila represent
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill um to follow up
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
on rep Cason's question I'm looking at
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
the Asher website uh vly they warn
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
against this practice and I've looked
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
into this to understand why and they
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
offer a number of rationale some of
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
which may be reasonable but the primary
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
rationale they offer for being against
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
this is that they can consider
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
communication to be an individual human
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
right and they believe that by using an
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
aid to assist somebody you are actually
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
depriving the child of his or her
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
autonomy but wouldn't it wouldn't it be
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
true that if this
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
works they would be better to
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
communicate with the help of an aid than
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
to not be able to communicate at
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
all I'm I'm going to say that I I I have
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
heard stories of from family members
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
whose adult children with
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
autism they they basically have have
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
lived in this fear what's going to
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
happen to my son or daughter when I'm
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
gone and for the first time they feel
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
like their son or daughter is fully able
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
to communicate and that they will be
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay that to me is profound I I think
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
that there is there is a profound sense
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
that this enables autonomy and and um
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
again I'll let some some of the other
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
folks speak to to that point Thank you
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
represent Damon thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward and taking
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
my question could you speak to us about
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
how someone becomes a certified s2c
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
practitioner I can try but again it's
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's a my knowledge of it is not going
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
to be as detailed as some of the other
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
people in the room um there is an
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
application process and
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
um it's I believe the cost is around
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
$33,000 to become
 
00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:04.790 align:start position:0%
$33,000 to become
certified

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that the the on-site
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
training I believe that there is on-site
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
training in Atlanta is where that that
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
takes place I may be mistaken about that
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
there is also a coaching process
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
generally when someone is a new
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
practitioner uh there's a mentoring
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
process that follows that and often
 
00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
process that follows that and often
includes

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah let's say a kind of co- teing
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
relationship with someone else who is uh
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
is more experienced in the methodology
 
00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
is more experienced in the methodology
thank

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes represent
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you thank you
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt um I think as you
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
pointed out there is some
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
controversy about this method and I I
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
think um when you talk about facilitated
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
communication um I've also SE seen it
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
referred to as a rapid response method
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
or rapid prompting method um which is um
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
um well per semi-personal experien in
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
that my daughter is a special ed teacher
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
um outside of Austin and um she has used
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh letter board or spelling board um
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
however her students um are not
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
functionally able to use
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
it um there was also a lady in Austin
 
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.670 align:start position:0%
it um there was also a lady in Austin
who

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
uses this facilitated communication and
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
has convinced um people that um uh
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
anyone can um learn to communicate using
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
this method um but only
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
she can use this method she's the only
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
one who knows how to use this method
 
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I I've also read that there is one
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
study which is maybe the study that
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
you're referring to um I'm just curious
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
about um other studies that show that um
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
this method is not there's no uh
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
facilitator bias in the method in in um
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh that the uh student can actually uh
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
do this themselves and uh are there
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
other studies besides that one that you
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'll I'll let people who who
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
follow me okay answer that I as
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
regarding facilitated communication I'll
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
say that if you watch some of the
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
YouTube videos of people who are very
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
early in the process you will see a
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
coach patiently working with them kind
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
of knowing what it is that they're going
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
to spell if you see people who have
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
graduated to higher levels and are
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
further along with the process you will
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
see them sitting at a computer keyboard
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
tapping out answers to questions where
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
there is no facilitator sitting next to
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
them or prompting them in any way
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I I again I I think it's
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's fairly obvious uh just by
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
observation um but again I will let
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
others uh answer the question of of
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
formal studies in further have one quick
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes um one question on the
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill language itself there is an
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation for 120
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um but you're also making
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
non-public schools available for Grants
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
from this appropriation is that correct
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and your reasoning for including
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
non-public schools um because I I don't
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
think it should be limited so I you know
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to make it available to as
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
many as many people as possible um one
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the people in the room today who's
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
going to be testifying is is a
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooler um so they're currently
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
private paying for it um it's it's kind
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
of a heavy lip it's not it's not it's
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money but for somebody
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
who's on a very tight budget trying to
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
to look after her adult daughter it's
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's not easy um so yes I wanted to make
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
it available to as wide a group as
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
possible are there further questions
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.829 align:start position:0%
possible are there further questions
represent

00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you do you have any
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
information on how many students would
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
be likely to be eligible for this
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
program I don't unfortunately no further
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative Pell thank you
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
question my original question was how
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
many students in the state might be
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for a program like that but
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
that's not the question I'm going to ask
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
after listening to representative
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
cordell's um question I as he was
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
speaking I was thinking about um a great
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
example we have of someone who
 
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
example we have of someone who
possibly

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
um became very successful as a result of
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
facilitated communication and that made
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
me think of um shoot Helen Keller and
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
the assistance she had with Anne
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and would you agree that maybe
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
this might be a new breakthrough in
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
teaching people how to communicate she
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
certainly had to be facilitated in order
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
to become a very successful author and
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
leader in our country I I absolutely
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a breakthrough I
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
think when you hear from people who've
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
who whose lives have been affected by it
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the impact that it has on them and
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
how it takes somebody from being in a
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
prison of
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
non-communication to having autonomy and
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
dignity and to me it's it's a world of
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
difference and you hear that um you'll
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
hear it today I think and if you if you
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
watch the movie spellers or if you read
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
the book
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
underestimated you will hear those
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
stories over and over again
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
further questions not see any thank you
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
very much thank you uh for the following
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
people I'm going to limit discussion of
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
three minutes per person uh we have a
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
number of cards here so I'd like to
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um my handwriting can
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
be pretty bad so I apologize for that my
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
name is actually Patricia Cook okay and
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
I'm from London da New Hampshire and my
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
friends teased me I should have been a
 
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
doctor um I am the mother of four sons
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
and I have been fortunate enough to
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
watch them all grow up in into men and
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
I've heard them speak their first words
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
and see them Advance into speaking into
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
sentences uh um but imagine regressing
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
and only being able to speak in one or
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
two word
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
phrases that's what happened to my my
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
youngest son
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
Liam um when he was two and a half years
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
old so I felt like I lost my
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
son he can no longer Express himself and
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
was using only those one or two words to
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
get his his basic needs
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
met so imagine he couldn't he couldn't
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
ever tell me when he was hurt either
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
emotionally or
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
physically um and he got he did get sick
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
um you know numerous times when he was
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
young he got stre through throat a
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
number of times and could never tell me
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
that he was hurting but I would end up
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
getting the STP throat and then we would
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
know that Liam had strep throat we would
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
get him tested and it was always him it
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
was not none of the other boys it was
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
always Liam because the other ones
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
obviously could tell me if they were
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
sick um he broke his arm we didn't know
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
till the next day when it all swelled up
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
um you know CU initially right after the
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
injury you know he had he had he had his
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
uncle fall on top of him actually um we
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it was broken um he ended
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
up in the hospital twice in fourth grade
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh because he stopped eating and
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
drinking and you know I had a fight with
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
the doctors at Elliot Hospital to get
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
him admitted and treated because they
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
felt it was all
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral um he ended up being severely
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
constipated the doctor said there was
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely no more room for food to to
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
go into his intestines so they could
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
have burst and all that bacteria would
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
have ended up in his bloodstream so he
 
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
could have died all because he couldn't
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
tell us what was going on with his
 
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.589 align:start position:0%
tell us what was going on with his
body

00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
um um he Liam's now 19 years old he was
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with autism and intellectual
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
disability when he was 5 years
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
old um you know
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
I never really believed the latter
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
because I always felt he was intelligent
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
just that he just couldn't get it out
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
you he didn't have the the speech to do
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
that um he has been in speech therapy
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
standard traditional speech therapy
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
since he was three years old he had it
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
he's had it in school he's had he has a
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
private speech therapist so he has it
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
multiple times a week he's been
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
evaluated at Boston Children's Hospital
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
autism language program and his language
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
is only increased minimally
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
um he uses the same phrases daily you
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
know they just wrote phrases like you
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
ask him a question I don't know um when
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
he sees me the first thing he says to me
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
is what are you making for dinner this
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
this could be at 8:00 in the
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
morning okay um but you know he found
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
the spellers program in May we've been
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
doing it um and now I feel like I'm

Christmas card that this is has been the
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
intelligence he told us that triom 21 is

commonly known as Down syndrome when
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
asked for an antonym for virtuous he
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
spelled out the word
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
malevolent um your your time is up oh
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah so I I I asked for you to

education um that's at their level of
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
intelligence are you willing to take any
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
questions sure other questions from the
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee one represent Woodcock thank
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
you CH good morning thank you here I
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate can you tell me how long you
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
son's been involved in the program he
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
just started in the end of May of this
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
year excuse me of 2023 and you're
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
thinking about that his success so far
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
oh yes I I see it he I every every
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
session he blows my mind with with what
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
he knows and and and um great thank you
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
so much appreciate itk are there further
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you listening you're
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning good morning uh
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and members of the
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
Center I've held this position for just
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
a little over two years and prior to
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
that from the fall of 2005 until I
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
started my job as policy director I
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
provided individual representation for
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
children among other things but children
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
in special education cases and I'm here
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
in to testify in opposition to this bill
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
not because I'm in I'm going to say
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
anything about spells to communicate
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
that is far beyond my expertise but
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
because I think that it sets a poor
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
precedent school districts are already
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
required to evaluate children who for
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
special education they're supposed to
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
evaluate them in all areas of suspected
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
disability and have by qualified
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
evaluators to determine one whether the
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
student meets the criteria as a student
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
with a disability but also to determine
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
what services and supports that child
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
needs including whether they need
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
assistive technology in order to receive
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education fape
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
something you're all familiar with so
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of diverting funds to one
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
particular program or incentivizing one
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
particular program undermines that
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of idea that
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
schools evaluate children to by
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
qualified people to determine what
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
program they need and what is the most
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
effective intervention and to make that
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
intervention available to students and I
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
know having worked at the disability
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
rights Center where you know people
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't call us if they're happy that
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
schools we get calls from parents who
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
are dissatisfied with what schools are
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
doing to address their children's needs
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
and there are procedures in place do
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
process complaint procedures for parents
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
to follow when schools aren't doing what
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing to address
 
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.589 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing to address
needs

00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
um but just giving money to parents for
 
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
a program without an
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
evaluation it it may actually cause
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
schools to send children to this program
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
instead of providing the program that
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
actually more closely aligns to what
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
their individualized needs are so I
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
think that's problematic I can tell you
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I've represented children with
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
communication issues and AAC is
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly powerful it can be so
 
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
powerful but over the years that I've
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
represented students with communication
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
issues I I don't know that any of them
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
have been prescribed the same program
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
I've had students start with something
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
as rudimentary as objects like when they
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
really didn't understand communication
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
at all so and literally a physical
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
object to communicate I need to eat
 
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
here's a spoon I need to use the
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
facilities here's a you know little toy
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
toilet up through students who are
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
communicating at a much higher level
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
using more sophisticated devices so um
 
00:58:28.029 --> 00:58:28.039 align:start position:0%
you know children do need the
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be evaluated and to
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
communicate in the best way for them and
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
um this wouldn't do that and for that
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
reason we oppos this bill and I'm really
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you might
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much are there
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
for being here for this testimony you
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
brought up a very important point that I
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
want to just drill down on a little bit
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
and you talked about the um the possible
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
need for technology assisted um learning
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
and the provision of funds for that but
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
in this program an aid holding a board
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem like a technology to
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
me so would that be Avail would that be
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
available to be funded under current um
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
law on this or would that not be yeah it
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
could be funded like I said it doesn't
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
when you think about assisted technology
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know we think about like high-tech
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
but assist of Technology can also be
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
quite low Tech so there are students
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
that um their technology might be like I
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
said something as rudimentary as a
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
client of mine who really was so had so
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
much ground to make up that that
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
particular student was given little
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
objects that's not high-tech right
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
eventually that student graduated to a
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
much more high-tech communication but
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
yes if that communic whatever is
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what that student needs
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain a free appropriate public
 
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.309 align:start position:0%
to obtain a free appropriate public
education

00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
then that is what the school has an
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide and if I may just
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
to just to drill down uh so not not just
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
the board itself but you could fund the
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
aid having the aid there yeah if that's
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a there's actually a
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
section in an IEP that describes what
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
kind of if it's specialized instruction
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
what they need if it's an auxiliary Aid
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
or supplementary service they need so
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
yes all of those things that the student
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
would need can be funded through the IEP
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you further question questions
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative pill
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question and for being here so
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to um I'm asking you to
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate your concern is probably in
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
section um Roman numeral 2 where it says
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
under this program any parent so not
 
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
just a student with an IEP who's H
 
01:00:45.319 --> 01:00:46.390 align:start position:0%
just a student with an IEP who's H
already

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
having who where the school already has
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about their ability is that
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to but can you
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
tell me so I'm on page one Roman
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
two have been an application yeah I mean
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
I mean one thing one concern I have is
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
that schools that aren't doing their job
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
that want to kind of get out from under
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
their obligations under federal law
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
might be incentivized to say to the
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
parent oh your child is having problems
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
sure we'll give you this
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
$4,500 and you can arrange for your
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
child's communication needs to be met
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then we won't need to fund an
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation which is required under
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
federal law we won't need to consider
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
what is the most appropriate
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
intervention for your child so yeah
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
concern we well the thing just has a
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
mind itself um further
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.589 align:start position:0%
 
Rogers

01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
members for allowing us to testify or
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
from you to testify this morning I am
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
here in to please ask you to please
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
support hb1 1553 so I'm the mother of a
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
33-year-old son Craig he's a
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
non-speaking uh young man with autism
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
and apraxia so his autism and aaia
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
prevents him from speaking the way I am
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
right now the messages from his brain to
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
his mouth to these muscles is
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
disconnected so what spelling to
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
communicate does is takes this very fine
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
motor skill of verbal speech and puts it
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
into the very gross motor skill of
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
pointing to letters to spell out words
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
phrases and sentences to say what he
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
wants to communicate it's so so simple
 
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.789 align:start position:0%
wants to communicate it's so so simple
it's

01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:57.549 align:start position:0%
it's
amazing

01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
so without a communication device like
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
s2c um Craig if you had seen Craig you
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
would probably think he was unaware of
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
his surroundings or that he was not
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
intelligent because he could not speak
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
with tools like this he can now be open
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
and not trapped in his own head with his
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
own thoughts and pains and desires and
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
wants and needs he now has this method
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
to tell us and I'm going to share with
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
you two major ways that has impacted his
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
life and our lives the first one is
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
health and
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
wellbeing before s2c we never knew
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether he was sick had a headache a
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
throat sore throat a stomach ache now
 
01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:44.839 align:start position:0%
with s2c the last time we saw his doctor
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
he was able to communicate I have a
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
stomach ache she examined him and
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
realized he had a hiatal hernia which
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
was treated he also told another
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
physician um that he wanted to learn how
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
to calm down and heal his anxiety so we
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
went through different methods of
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
meditation we taught him how to become
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
more regulated and he told us that
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
exercise helps his anxiety so exercise
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
has become a major role in his daily
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
activities which is amazing um the the
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
second part is since education
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
before s2c we call it or spelling to
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
communicate he could display very
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
rudimentary basic academic things now we
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
are learning how smart he is he is doing
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
High School level and college level
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
course material and answering the
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions on the letter board right now
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
his goal is to graduate from this letter
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
board which yes I have to hold for him
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
as he points to the letters to graduate
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
to a laminated board then
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
independently type on a keyboard to say
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
and have his own autonomy in what he
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
wants to say so thank you for hearing my
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and also I feel it's going to
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
make the teachers lives so much easier
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
if they can actually communicate with
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
their students where they can't
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
now thank you thank you very much other
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions represent Miler thank you Mr
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being there sure is
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
that a letter board you have with you
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes how does it work so if Neil were
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
Craig and I said to Craig I usually I
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
ask him what he appreciates when I see
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
him every day and we work together I'll
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
ask him what he appreciates and I say
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
all right Craig can you tell me on the
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
board would you appreciate can you
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
please move back because you're too
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
close and you know he's a lefty so it's
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
hands over I'm going to use my right
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
okay so and then he'll go right to the
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
board and he'll answer and I say okay
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
hey find your letter scan the board and
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
he'll tell me I am appreciating like one
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
day he said I appreciate Beth who is his
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
practitioner and then I said okay well
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
why do you appreciate Beth and he
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
answered because because she has
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
patience with me I'm not touching him
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not coaching him I just say all
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
right go that's what I do now yes when
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
he was first starting Remember When
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put your four-year-old out on a
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
two- wheel bike without training wheels
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
first right and let them just go they
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
need training wheels too so in this
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
method they need training wheels they
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
need facilitation just like heler Keller
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
needed it so initially you are guiding
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
them scan the board scan the board find
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
your letter find your letter and then
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
they graduate to no prompting at all and
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
no nothing from us from their
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner or from their communication
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
regulation partner which is what I am
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
now um and then they then they tra then
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
they move on to the laminated board and
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
then independently on the
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
keyboard so thank you follow yes follow
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
up so excuse me so
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
initially your son has to learn the
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
letters how no he knows the letters
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
excellent question he knows the letters
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
he needs to learn the most M planning
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
remember CU aaia is that disconnect from
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
your motor cortex to the muscles of your
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
body he needs to learn this the the
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
motor planning to find the letters and
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
the motor planning to tell his eyes
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
where to go your eyes have like nine
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
muscles in each eye so the disconnect
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
between your motor cortex and your eye
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
muscles is there too when you have
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
autism and praia so we have to help his
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
tell his eyes move your eyes move move
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
your eyes scan the board he already
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
knows the letters he already knows many
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
complex words and sentences and and
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
ideas and thoughts and all that jazz um
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's the motor planning that's
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
missing that's the piece that's missing
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
thing repr cordelli yes thank you for
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
being here and congratulations um for
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
the story about your son um did he
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
receive um this instruction with the um
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
therapist facilitator via an IEP at
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
school no Craig is 33 we discovered this
 
01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.709 align:start position:0%
school no Craig is 33 we discovered this
in

01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
2022 he was
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
31 he had speech therapy three times a
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
week every week of his life in public
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
education but what was missing there
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
was he had a pracy
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
so no one was working on that disconnect
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
him his brain to his body um and they
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
expected him to verbally speak which he
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
could not
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
do or or they were teaching him to point
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
to things on a laminated visual board
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
right so on a laminated visual board you
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
might have 20 choices of things you want
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
what if you didn't want any of those 20
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
choices so you know there were Foods or
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
activities or what have you but let's
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
say he wanted to go run intervals at the
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
Y that wasn't a choice on the board so
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
you're very limited in what you can
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
choose when you have a laminated picture
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
board let's say or an iPad with maybe 30
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
pictures on it what if you don't want
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
any of those 30 things you know so this
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
gives him the opportunity to really
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
Express with 26 letters you can say
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
anything in the world that you want and
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
oh by the way he knows Spanish so he
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
does it in Spanish too I have no idea
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
how but yeah thank you sure further
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning thank you so much
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
for being here um I'm assuming based on
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
your dialogue that you have been the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
trainer for you son oh I wish no his
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
trainer his
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner is a woman in New Hampshire
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
her name is Beth freed she is a trained
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
through I ask i- as.org trained
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner she works with Craig but
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
she also trained me how to do this also
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
I took a parent course through I ask so
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
to get trained as a practitioner it is
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
about $3,000 it takes about three month
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh six months and you do it uh on Zoom
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
virtually and you're also going out into
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
the community and and working with um
 
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
non-speaking individuals as a parent
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
cohort I went through the class it took
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
me about three months that was $750 and
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
I got trained but I also sit with Beth
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
when she's working with Craig and she
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
also coaches me on my method it is so
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
strict I ask has strict strict
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
methodology they never want you
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
to force your thought or your will or
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
your what you think the child or adults
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
should say on that person it's very
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
strict training very strict
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
protocols you yeah thank you sure
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
further further questions we have more
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
cards here so yes representative
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
Ford thank
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
sure would you tell us a little bit
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
experience yes when he was
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
younger I used to take take
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
books rewrite the sentences for him in
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
probably like a 20 point font cut them
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
out paste them into the book so that he
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
could follow the words and read it so
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
when he was five or six or seven years
 
01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
old he could
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
read but the font was very large so
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
we're going back to that aaia piece
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
now he he can I don't know how to
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
explain it but he can he can
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
read but the typing is so small that
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
when you have a praia to follow those
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
words and letters and have your eyes
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
move each line of the text it's very
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
difficult so when we're doing lessons
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
with him now we read the lesson to him
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
and ask him he's not reading anything
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
he's listening so the other day we were
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
doing a a lesson on courage and I read
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
the I read the lesson and I asked him a
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
question about courage and he answers
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
the question based on what he's heard
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
not not what he's read so we listen to
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
books on Audible and I ask him questions
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
about the books or the material we just
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
read what he's just
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
heard yeah thank you thank you no we're
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
not going to have a
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
followup um I'm gonna no further
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sure thank you
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
liban

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me chairman
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
lad and the rest of the group I'm Wendy
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
lbrand I'm a speech language pathologist
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I have been a speech
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
language pathologist for 23 years
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually 24 years um I graduated from
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
UNCC in 2000 and became an AAC
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
specialist I was also the president of
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
the North Carolina speech language
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearing Association and I served on the
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts speech language hearing
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
board I've also presented at Asha in the
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
past and at many state
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
conventions I'm here in opposition to
 
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.590 align:start position:0%
conventions I'm here in opposition to
The

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
The
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
Spill this is based on pseudo science I
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
know that previous people that have
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
spoken have said it's not but it does
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
not allow independent communication from
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
the person with a
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
disability all speech pathologists
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully presume confidence and we also
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
want independent ways for students to
 
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.229 align:start position:0%
want independent ways for students to
communicate

01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
and as a speech pathologist that has
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
worked in the schools my entire career
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
I've seen many failed attempts at that
 
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.310 align:start position:0%
I've seen many failed attempts at that
well-meaning

01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
well-meaning
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
attempts and then I've seen many many
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
very successful attempts the original
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
speaker the first person that spoke said
 
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
speaker the first person that spoke said
that

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
um students could never speak in full
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
languages and that's not true um
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
augmented of alternative communication
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
systems lamp in
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
particular Toby dbox touch chat there's
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
many research articles
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
longstanding that indicate that these
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
are languages and can be used with
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
Independence to allow people to
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
independently Express various viewpoints
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
even though there is a limited icon set
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
present I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
oh wait I want to say one more thing
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
Asha um rarely takes position statements
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
and it has a whole page if you haven't
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
looked at their website Asha warns
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
against rapid prompt method or spelling
 
01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.750 align:start position:0%
against rapid prompt method or spelling
to

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
communicate and there's a chart at the
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
end about why it warns against
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
it um and I'm happy to provide you this
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
copy if you'd like it's just the print
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
off from the
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
website um but it warns against it
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
because it denies people their human
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
right of independent communication it
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
always requires an aid for prompting and
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
prompts are not phased out it does not
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
align with existing research and
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
long-standing knowledge about
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
communication development and learning
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
it holds the potential for
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
misappropriated messages and false
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
claims of abuse it replaces effective
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
individualized communication support and
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities by diverting
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
resources which is exactly what we're
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
talking about here today time and money
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
to ineffective technique it gives false
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
hope and promotes unsubstantiated claims
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
talents now I'm done thank you very much
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
I do have a question for you I have a a
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
daughter who is a speech pathologist
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
with their sees and she practices in
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
Myrtle Beach um but I asked her were you
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
informed about facilitated communication
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
when you were taking your master's
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
program at University South Carolina
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
Medical School Charleston she said no um
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
can you explain why that is not uh being
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
taught at the level higher ed through
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
many of our teacher preparation Pro
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
Speech Pathology programs mhm well I
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak to your daughter's
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
experience it should be being taught but
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
as you know should and are different
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
words um I went to UNCC Chapel Hill and
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
graduated in 2000 and it definitely was
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
taught to me previous to that I went to
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
UVA undergrad which is an educational
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
program and majored in communication
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
disorders and it was also taught to me
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
there that facilitated communication is
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
s pseudo science because it requires
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
another adult to prompt you all this is
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
not to say that alphabet boards are not
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
assisted technology they are it's just
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they need to be able to be used
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
independently so if they're mounted and
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
the person is using their eye gaze or
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
their pointer independently without
 
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else touching them or prompting
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
them then that can be considered
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
assisted technology that's what the
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative for disability rights was
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
speaking about thank you further
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
being here for this testimony I want to
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
drill down a little bit on this concept
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
of independent communication and I want
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
to do so by an analogy and asking you
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
what you think of it let's say there's a
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill and it's going to have a extreme
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
impact on this one individual's life and
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to be here to
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
testify for that bill but they only
 
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.350 align:start position:0%
testify for that bill but they only
speak

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
Portuguese would it be more appropriate
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
for them to come here and testify on
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
that bill with the help of an
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
interpreter to let us know what they're
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
saying or would that be under this value
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
judgment would that be a negative item
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
because they themselves are not
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
independently communicating to this
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee well I think the use of an
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
interpreter for second language or a
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
non-native English speaker is very
 
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
different from the use of a
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
facilitator so an interpreter takes what
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
you say and translates that but you're
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
say the Portuguese speaker in this
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
instance would be saying that
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
independently The Interpreter wouldn't
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
be saying now I think you should say
 
01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.350 align:start position:0%
be saying now I think you should say
blank

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
blank
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
so they're very different things people
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
can independently even very young
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
children communicate
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
using AAC and assisted technology
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
without prompting from an adult does do
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
I mean to say that you never prompt
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
people when they're learning no but you
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
use AED language input which is more of
 
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
use AED language input which is more of
a

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
demonstration of what of how to use a
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
system you would never expect an AAC
 
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
user to learn to use an AAC system by
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
just plopping it down in front of them
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
and saying now use
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
it but the way you do that is through
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating it on yours and over time
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
the person realizes oh this has power it
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
has communicative power you're not
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
manipulating their arms or doing those
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of things thank you repr
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
question I don't have any experience
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
with this so so I'm trying to
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
understand in some of the cases
 
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.310 align:start position:0%
understand in some of the cases
presented

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
nonverbal apparently finding this
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
helpful and I am enough of a scientist
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
to appreciate that anecdotal report is
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
science but perhaps you could
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
help us better
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
understand if if those folks
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
had conventional speech therapy on an
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing and what would seem to be
 
01:20:35.159 --> 01:20:36.350 align:start position:0%
ongoing and what would seem to be
comprehensive

01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
basis and didn't become able to
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
communicate with
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
that why we wouldn't entertain this as
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
like one of the tools in the
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
toolbox I think it's a slippery slope um
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
of course you want hope for
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
communication and you always have
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
presumed competence which is exactly
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
what the other people were saying people
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
autistic individuals people with the
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
pracy of speech you must presume
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
confidence because you don't know
 
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
there's no way to know their cognitive
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
level they cannot
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
communicate um so both speech
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
pathologists in more traditional AAC
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
methods and in spelling to communicate
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
presume competence is there and there's
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
no debate about whether or not letter
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
boards can be used as assisted
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
technology um regarding having many
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
years of speech therapy and it not
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
working I I'm hesitant to speak to that
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't know the particular case
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
one example might be that the person
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
never had a an effective AAC evaluation
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
and so therefore never developed
 
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
and so therefore never developed
independent

01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
communication I would hate to think
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's true but I I'm and this is a
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
guess because I don't I don't know the
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
exact case you're speaking about I hope
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
that answers your
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes that is helpful could you also give
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
us some perspective on What proportion
 
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.430 align:start position:0%
us some perspective on What proportion
of

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
nonverbal folks with autism and Oro
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
independently well that's hard to say I
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
will say that the incidence of people
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
using AAC Across the Nation is
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
1% so it is a very low incidence but it
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
but that is not to say that it is not
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
very important to the people it happens
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
like it's it's gut-wrenching for parents
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
and families to have children that they
 
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
cannot communicate with and as a speech
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
pathologist the that's why I went in
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
into the profession I also became
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
certified as an assisted technology
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
professional through resna which is the
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
governing body of North America I mean
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
this was my job like my passion was to
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
help people communicate that could
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
not further represent dryan thank you
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
we heard a few examples here of people
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
who have graduated basically to um
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
keyboards and things which is not
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
prompted communication so wouldn't this
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
just be considered a step on the way to
 
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:33.639 align:start position:0%
getting to non prompted
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
communication for some people I guess it
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
can be but the idea that you are
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
dependent on a facilitator at any point
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
to communicate your ideas means that
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's not independent communication which
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
leads to the whole host of problems and
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
the reason that Asha came out with this
 
01:23:49.159 --> 01:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
the reason that Asha came out with this
position

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
statement against it in in
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
there's over 200,000 members of
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
Asha and this is this is just it's well
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
researched we've got many well
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
researched and evidence-based methods to
 
01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.390 align:start position:0%
researched and evidence-based methods to
assist

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
assist
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
non-speakers this is not one of them you
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
know on their own website there's five
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
studies they're all by the same
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
person like I'm all for the use of funds
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
I just think this is an exclusionary
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
bill that excludes the use of that 400
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
4,5 00 for other Research b based
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
methods if you want to open it up to
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
here if you're a non-speaker with autism
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
and a pracy of speech and you apply for
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
a $4,500 Grant to further your AAC
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
something that's been done by a
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
professional that you're you need funds
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
for training then more power to
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
you um I appreciate your time hopefully
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
that answered your question represent Dr
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up or any further
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're good uh represent for did you
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
have your hand
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
question I wonder about communication
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
and words that and ways that don't
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
depend on words because children can do
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
that M I have a three-year-old at home
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's not mine my
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
daughter's but she lives very much with
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations well she lives with me
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the same house and uh she walks up to
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
me and says may I kiss you you know and
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
you think she knows how to
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
communicate and so then you look at when
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
she gets frustrated she screams because
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have the word to say I'm a
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm frustrated so
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
communication to an actor is a lot of
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
things and so I wonder when we focus
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
only on Words and don't get me wrong I
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
love words have a p PhD in English so I
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
love words but I spent a long time
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
playing with them I taught myself to
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
read MH and my problem when I got to
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
school was when they handed out the book
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
in the first grade I read it while they
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
were handing him out and so I wanted to
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
talk to the girl next to me about what
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
was in the book right and of course I
 
01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:19.149 align:start position:0%
was in the book right and of course I
was

01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
disruptive so and my colleagues will
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
attest to that so I think your question
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
is how much of communication is
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
non-verbal well it's about we've all
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
been talking about articulation as
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
communication but it's not all there is
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
to communication that is definitely true
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
much of communication is non-verbal and
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
most of what we say on a typical day not
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
today because we're here talking about
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
this but in your basic conversational
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
speech it's about 400 to 600 words make
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
up about 80% of of what people say so
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
words are not
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
everything thank you thank you very much
 
01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.109 align:start position:0%
everything thank you thank you very much
further

01:27:02.109 --> 01:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for coming
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
pasquil Pali yeah pasquali yeah that's I
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you'll know I'm Italian in a
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
yeah you'll know I'm Italian in a
minute

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and members of the House
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
Education committee my name is Beth deep
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
pasquali and that is my adult daughter
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
Beth there Grace we live in Wilton I'm
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
asking you to support the house bill
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
1553 and creating a pilot project to
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
introduce spelling to communicate also
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
known as s2c into schools this project
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
is necessary for individuals who are
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
non-speakers minimal speak speakers or
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
unreliable speakers to live full
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
inclusive and productive lives for many
 
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
years I participated in traditional
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
speech therapy with the hopes that
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
someday I would have a meaningful
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with Grace and by
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful I
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
mean uh I'm talking about her telling me
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
what she wants to do with her life does
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
she think that Greek mythology is as
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
awesome as I do and what does she
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
believe in what is her spiritual path
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
meaningful as if saying more than just
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
mama I want a
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
snack for the last year and a half after
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
being introduced to s2c at an autism
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
conference I have been blessed to
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
experience those meaningful moments with
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
my daughter that's when I understood
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
that the reason my daughter was not
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
producing verbal output was due to her
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
araxia she knows what she wants to do or
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
say she just can't make her body do it I
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
also learned that by using a letter
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
board which uses gross motor movements
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
by poking letters instead of verbal
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
output which is a fine motor skill and
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
more difficult my daughter has gained
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
the skills to communicate what she wants
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
to know and what she wants to share I'll
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
be honest at first I was very skeptical
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
but once I started using it with my
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
daughter all that
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
changed recently grace spelled in her uh
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
to her s2c practitioner at a trading
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
session every time mom is spelling she
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
thinks she has to be perfect what you
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
have suggested is going to help
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
tremendously it's amazing the wisdom in
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
that statement she knew that I was
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
trying to be
 
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
perfect you see the premise that motor
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
planning differences could be at the
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
root of non-speakers communication
 
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:49.639 align:start position:0%
difficulties are just beginning to be
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledged however the research
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
supporting that claim has been acing for
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
some time when individuals with aaia are
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
taught the motor skills needed to
 
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
organize their body's gross motor
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
movements they can and do show their
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
intelligence in all the test that we
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
have to access cognition there is no
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
accommodations made for motor planning
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties all of these tests require
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
motor control and coordination of the
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
brain and body in order to show what
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
they know only after being given a
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
reliable communication method can
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
cognitive ability be accurately measured
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
spelling to communicate is that method
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
for my daughter and countless others
 
01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.870 align:start position:0%
for my daughter and countless others
with

01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
aaia passing this bill and allowing this
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
pilot project to move forward could be
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
the key to unlocking many doors for
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
those who are prisoners in their own
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
bodies thank you chairman lad and
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
members of the House of Education
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee for considering my testimony I
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
urge you to support hb1

Rodriguez yeah and um you say you have
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony you didn't take a
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
position just want to speak to this bill
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you good morning uh
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives um my name is isidora
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
Rodriguez legendre I'm the executive
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire Council on
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and we are
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
DED at to advocacy capacity building and
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
systems change work in New Hampshire
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
that helps remove barriers and create
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for all individuals with
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities we are neutral on this bill
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
however that being said that is
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
primarily because our membership drives
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
our work our members are people with
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities parents
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
Guardians and agencies
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
um dedicated with similar uh missions in
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
supporting people with developmental
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh because of the
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
controversy and because of um some of
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you heard here today
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
our membership could not agree on a
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
position that being said one of the um
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
guiding oppositions to this bill is that
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's not an evidence-based
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
practice it's important to develop
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
evidence in order to determine whether
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
interventions are going to work and
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
pilot studies are a good way of doing
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
that um understanding that not every
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
intervention is going to work for every
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
individual that communication is very
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
personal and should be person centered
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
self-determination uh should be
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
considered the primary f Focus having
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
someone be able to communicate
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
independently is the goal always um
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
so understanding that this
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
intervention is something that some
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
families or individuals may be willing
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
to explore and some may not um it's
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
important to
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
develop um an understanding about what
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
the potential is for this intervention
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
um within the autism and araxia
 
01:33:59.070 --> 01:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
communities um I'm happy to take
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions I have written testimony uh
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
which kind of highlights some of the
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
points uh that I've
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um again we're neutral on the
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh but we do believe that uh
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
removing barriers and creating
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities for individuals to
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
communicate is a
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
primary um need and support the ability
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
of individuals to explore those any
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
intervention that might help them do
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much are there
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
your test uh testimony and expertise on
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
this um you brought up a point that um
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
autonomous communication is the goal
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's a very laudable goal um it's
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
ideal I'm wondering is it possible at
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
least in a a Hy hypothetical context
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
that given our current abilities our
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
current knowledges and our current
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
practices there might be a portion of
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
the population that is not currently
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
going to become capable of fully
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
autonomous communication but might be
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy some degree of
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
intermediary that's a great question and
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
I would not want to speculate on that
 
01:35:18.119 --> 01:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
I would not want to speculate on that
point

01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
um however that being said there are
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
individuals with all kinds of
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities who depend on supporters on
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
Direct support professionals to be able
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
to eat shower go to work be
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
transported um and so ve very likely
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
this could
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
be another um skill set that someone may
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
need support
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
with further questions from the
 
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.590 align:start position:0%
with further questions from the
committee

01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you you're
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
welcome with that I'm going to close the
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
1553 and we will get ready here to move
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
into the next hearing which we have
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled for today is relative to
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
establishing a local education Freedom
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
account program which would be 1652 I
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
have to about make three PR calls to
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
doe and so would you just take this one
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
I it looks like we have Kevin doing this
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
far

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
you next next on our agenda for this
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
morning is House Bill
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
1652 relative to establishing a local
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program and we
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
have the uh Prime sponsor representative
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
verbal thank
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
you now it's on yeah there we go uh good
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
morning uh honorable colleagues it's
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
like deja vu all over again um I assume
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
you all recognize this bill is we we had
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
some fairly robust discussions about
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
this uh a year ago and uh unfortunately
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
it was it was set upon the table and
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's something that I'm passionate
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
enough about that I'm coming back for
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
another bite of the apple and so since
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
we've already had a lot of discussions
 
01:37:49.589 --> 01:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
about the workings of the
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill I'd like to tell tell you a little
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
story about
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
Deerfield uh to maybe persuade some of
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
you that have been uh reluctant to
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill to maybe change your
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
mind I'm going to talk about a bunch of
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
different schools I'm not saying one
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
school is better than the other I'm not
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to try to sift and sort but
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you a little
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
history over 20 years ago Deerfield had
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
almost Universal school
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
choice wherever you wanted to send your
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
kid Deerfield School District would
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
would pay the tuition to send your child
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
there and at the time New Hampshire had
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
rapidly increasing student
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
populations and that meant there were
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer seats available in fewer
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
and fewer
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
schools and it became problematic for
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
Deerfield to
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
ensure every student had a had a spot
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
that would meet their
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
needs and so the solution 20 years ago
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
for that problem was to enter into an
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
exclusive almost exclusive contract with
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
conquered High School send they accept
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
they agreed to accept all of our
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
students for a 10-year span at um I
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
believe originally it was a 90%
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
minimum and that that worked okay he
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a spot for every kid and and
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
it it certainly you know met the the
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
bare minimum
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
needs after 10 years it was time for
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
Deerfield to re-evaluate our
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
situation we looked at several high
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
schools we had parent groups we had
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
work and I think it's fairly well
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
recognized that the parents wanted to go
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere other than conquered and there
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
were other schools that could take all
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
students the school board in its
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
Infinite Wisdom chose to renew a 10-year
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
contract with conquer largely driven by
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that conquered got uh very uh
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
competitive with its tuition rate
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
because it it knew it was it it was
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
potentially going to lose
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
students that 10-year contract second
 
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
students that 10-year contract second
10year

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
10year
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
contract ends the end of June of this
 
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
year the 13-year exclusive cont contract
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
with conquered was proposed by the
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
school board and soundly defeated by the
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
voters of Deerfield voters of Deerfield
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
wanted school
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
choice an election was held a new
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
majority came in they did their
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
homework and what they did is they
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
negotiated with conquered high school
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
and a bunch of other schools where they
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
settled on was conquered High School
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
coob Brown Northwood Academy Academy and
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
pem Academy no minimums no maximums
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
rates and this year's eighth
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
graders more than
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
half chose coob
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
brown little less than half chose
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
conquered as far as I know last count
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
nobody chose Pembrook Academy for
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
right and so so that's what's going to
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
happen there was a small number of
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
students currently attending conquered
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
high school that have chosen to transfer
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
to co Brown next year now that that
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
option is
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
available those students those families
 
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
believe that Co Brown is a better fit
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
for their child's education and it's
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
fantastic that they have that
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity but wait it gets better
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
better we always say that we want all of
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
participating in the public education
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire right I think we
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
we all more or less agree on
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we have students coming out of
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
non-public school settings returning to
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the Deerfield Public School System for
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
high school starting next
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
year so why would that be why would you
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
leave a private school why would you
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
leave home school why would you why
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
would you leave some other setting to
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
come back to the public school
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
system I guess first you have to ask why
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
did they leave in the first place they
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
left in the first place because the
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
school that was offered was not meeting
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
their needs and so they had to seek
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
out and so now we have more options in
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
Deerfield and we have students returning
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
back to the public school system that's
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
a win-win that's a win for everybody in
 
01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.270 align:start position:0%
a win-win that's a win for everybody in
my

01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.109 align:start position:0%
my
opinion

01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
right so is that the end all be for
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
Deerfield no I I don't I don't believe
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
it is I think there are probably
 
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
families sending uh students
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
to public school options in Deerfield
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
that would probably prefer something
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
else but they can't afford it or or the
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
school board didn't negotiate with that
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
board that other school so it makes it
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
difficult and so
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
does is it allows a community by a super
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
majority vote to decide for themselves
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
if they want local education funding
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
money local tax money to be able to
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
student into a school that they believe
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
is a more appropriate
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
setting for their child for their
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
children I know we've had discussions
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
could be a runaway fiscal train it could
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
be right but it's enabled by a super
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
majority and it can be disabled by a
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
super majority so if a town chose to
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
enable if a school district my apologies
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
if a school district chose to enable
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
this and find out discovered later that
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
it was fiscally overburdensome they can
 
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.149 align:start position:0%
it was fiscally overburdensome they can
dis

01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
dis
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
discontinue the the project right and so
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
what it is is it takes State adequacy
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
multiplies it by two the bill um for a
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
community for a school district that
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
that adopts it the students that go
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that take the local EFA
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be counted for daily membership so
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
the state adequacy flows to the school
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
would then flow to the EFA and then a
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
matching amount for the same amount just
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
to make the math easy we we Peg it to
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant can follow that
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
student that amount of
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
money is more than enough to allow the
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
vast majority of families to choose
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
virtually any education setting that
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
they want for their
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
children that is a win-win and if they
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
don't spend all of that money right if
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
they can educate their child four less
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
the money that that sits in that account
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
upon High School graduation or age of 21
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
goes back to the local school district
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
to offset taxes or or it basically goes
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
into the general funds or whatever the
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
the district chooses to to do with
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
deerfield's an anecdote I get it right
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
one's an anecdote two is a coincidence
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
and three you can you can fit a line so
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
let's go to let's go to coincidence
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
level right we look at the state EFA
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
program and how wildly popular that is
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
because there's far more students
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
choosing to participate in that than uh
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
were originally projected so it's
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
wildely successful we know that there's
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
a need out there we know that that
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
parents want choices for their children
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
children this is a a nice local
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
control and and it could bring students
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
back into the public school system how
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
many of you have are in school districts
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
in declining
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment considering uh closing down
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
schools because you don't have the
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
students we're trying to find ways to
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
consolidate if you had a school that's
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
competitive and attractive
 
01:46:24.189 --> 01:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
and you had a school district near you
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
that enabled this program you could draw
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
those students in right you could you
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
could actually grow your student
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
population because students will go to
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
the schools providing the services that
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
they need want and have to have and if
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
you see a decline in a school district
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
because of choice that should be very
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
telling to the school district L losing
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
students to other districts that maybe
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's time to re-evaluate the
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
product and services being provided to
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
better meet the needs of their actual
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
local constituents and maybe draw others
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
in and so I I would beg that uh the the
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
10 that voted uh in favor of ought to
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
pass for this bill hold strong and for
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
those of you that supported
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
itl I would ask you to give that some
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
thought give that some consideration and
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
would I would beg you I would implore
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
you to please support an a to pass so we
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
can get a majority a to pass on the
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
floor so we can at least have a robust
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
floor debate and and then uh see what
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
the the will of the body is thank you Mr
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
representative um representative Miler
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
being here this morning uh you had
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
indicated that the previous bill that
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
you presented was tabled uh does this
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
does 16 52 is it the same bill that was
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
tabled or have you made some
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
modifications to it it is the same Bill
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my pleasure thank
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
you R dry thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh in
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
the town of Cornish uh there's no high
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
school and when students reach high
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
school age they can go to any High
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
School of the surrounding areas uh for a
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
set tuition and the parents pay the
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
balance if this passes uh would that be
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
continue or how would that change thank
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
you for the question that that's an
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
excellent question um so this bill would
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
not change that policy so if I
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly and please
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong um you're
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
tuition students to anywhere they want
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
to go under essentially a top off
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
agreement right so there's a a minimum
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
set amount because there's at least one
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
School uh that'll take all your kids at
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
that amount and if they want to go
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere more expensive if they make up
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
the difference right is that what you
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
doing yeah so that so Deerfield
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
considered that and we we chose not to
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
do top off agreement so we pay the
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
tuition of whatever the school is
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
currently that's our and these are
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
three-year contracts with these three
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
schools so no this bill would not change
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
that um and and so with essentially un
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
Universal school choice like that it's
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
hard to believe a community would choose
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt this because you already have
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
what this is enabling uh but you know
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
you never know till you ask the voters
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
right voters can decide for
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.790 align:start position:0%
right voters can decide for
themselves

01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.550 align:start position:0%
themselves
representative

01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning thank you for
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
being here um in your dialogue you
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that U how much money was the
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
FY youngster or the student and then you
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
said that amount of money uh will be
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
enough and so I was trying to get to
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
figure how much is that amount of
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
money yeah that's an excellent question
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
and so um I'll refine my my remarks so I
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
think it goes to um similar to what uh
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh in in representative Dy
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
dr's District right
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of working class middle
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
class Working Poor they they cannot
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
afford school choice period the end they
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
just don't have the cash for that we're
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
talking about approximately
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
$88,000 following a student um for a a
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
school district that would approve
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
this there are uh there are high schools
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that you can attend for
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
for about eight grand right um if you
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
choose a more expensive school then yes
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
it the burden would fall on the family
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh to make up that that difference right
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
because you're not forcing anybody to do
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
anything you're not forcing them to take
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
this up but if you make if you look at
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
the the the state EFA that
 
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
$4,000 has enabled a lot of families to
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
pursue other options that previously
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
they they they could not
 
01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
do this increasing that amount um
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
significantly increases the the the
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
amount of students that potentially
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
could try something
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
differently Paul thank you so the figure
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking there is about $8,000
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah State Ade so it's pegged adequacy
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
so as adequacy floats um the grant
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
floats right um there is a safety net
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
that a student's firste Grant sets a
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold So a family has a
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
safety net that they know it'll never be
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
less than that so they one year they
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be caught where all of a sudden
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
oh I got to I got a pitch in another
 
01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
oh I got to I got a pitch in another
$1,000

01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
$2,000 um so it sets a safety safety net
 
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
there so yeah it's Peg to adequacy right
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
now that's about eight grand thank you
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Tanner thank you
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
noticed there's no fiscal note with this
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
and also I noticed that there's no it
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
has an FN but no l and one of the to
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
indicate the local
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
um fiscal uh Duty with this and I'm just
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could comment on why
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note and why there's
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
no local indicated in the um the chapter
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
Law chapter bill yeah thank you for the
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
question representative and and I have
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
to admit I'm I'm probably uh the least
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer um all of that
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
thoroughly uh what I will say is that
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
the uh office of legislative budget
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
assistant is unable to complete the
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this bill so they're
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
trying uh as introduced as it's awaiting
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh information from the Department of
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
Education why the Department of
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
Education is is lagging on this I'm not
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
exactly uh I'm not exactly sure so I I
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
can't I can't answer that apparently it
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
is expected at uh at some point in the
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
future it is a local impact I don't I
 
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.189 align:start position:0%
future it is a local impact I don't I
don't

01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how you would
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
calculate that so if I can I complete
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
the answer though just to let you know
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
so so I agree it's it should be FNL
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
right because it it goes to local monies
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
more than State monies because the
 
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy doesn't doesn't change just
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
where it
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
goes if everything I've been told about
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
my local public school is true and if
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
everything that I believe why families
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to choose local public rols is
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct then I would think the fiscal
 
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
impact would be uh incredibly limitate
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh limited uh because most students uh
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
prefer and families prefer their local
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
public school uh through grade eight
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
there's free
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation families of children want
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
their children to grow up and socialize
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
with neighborhood kids they want their
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
child to have a sense of community and
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
typically speaking the local public
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
school especially in a rural state like
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the local public school uh
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
is much closer than anything else one of
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
the complaints of conquet of course for
 
01:53:58.109 --> 01:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
us was the the travel time right from
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
from Deerfield to to conquered High um
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
is is considerable and so if you if you
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
have a thriving robust public school
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's meeting the the the needs and the
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
wants of students and families in the
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
community I would think a precious few
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
people would Avail themselves of a
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
program like this if it was enabled in
 
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
program like this if it was enabled in
their

01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
Community I would also confess that the
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
converse is true if you have um without
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
going into definition unless you want to
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
have that discussion if you have a
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
failing local public school if you have
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
a local public school that is not
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
providing the services and uh and the
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
product that that local families are
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
looking for um then yeah I can imagine a
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
program like this would be uh very very
 
01:54:49.159 --> 01:54:50.270 align:start position:0%
program like this would be uh very very
appealing

01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
appealing
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
and um so yeah I mean
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's quickly
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
please so um this is the second bite of
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
the Apple you've and maybe the third and
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
fourth as far as I'm concerned I've seen
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
it quite a bit so I'm wondering if if it
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
is the second bite of the Apple just
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
like the one that we had last time why
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't the education department and I
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
know you probably can't answer this but
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
it seems very odd that the educ ation
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
Department can't come up with a fiscal
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
note and that you can't get some idea of
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost locally because
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
locally it's going to cost people money
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to give money into
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
the CFA and again there's little
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
accountability for that money and Co
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
Brown has a requirement of a certain
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
academic ability to get into Co Brown um
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
they have a test that the kids have to
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
take to get into Co Brown and there's
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
also schools that discriminate against
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh other kids so M the questions are
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
getting long I I'll answer every
 
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
question you have know why the
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
information is missing that's why I
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't I'm I'm wondering why the
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
information's missing yeah thank you so
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
to to take the first question I'm going
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
to stick with my original answer how do
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
you calculate what this costs if a local
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
District chooses to enable the program
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
how do you predict what it's going to
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
cost without knowing how many students
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
in that District would choose to Avail
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
them themselves right so I don't believe
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
that it can be calculated the cost
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
locally will be about $4,000 per student
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
which is typically far less than what a
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
local school uh invests in per in a per
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
pupil charge even if we use the state um
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
average spend per student per District
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
because they back a lot of spending out
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
right that to try to uniform the number
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh as to your allegations about how coob
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
Brown Northwood
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
Academy chooses to operate as a public
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
school I I have to admit we've had
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
robust discussions about this in
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
Deerfield and most of the accusations
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
that you are laying at their feet have
 
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
been laid bare coob Brown Northwood
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
Academy provides specialed services to
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
specialed students and fact for for a
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
deer field if a child is in special ed
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
there is an upcharge to cover those
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
charges cobr Northwood Academy is one of
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
the best academically performing schools
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
in this state and has been for decades
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
and it is a desirable school and they
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
receive students from Northwood and
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
straford and I think a few other
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
communities but Northwood and straford
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
that is the the school of record that is
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
the school they sent all their kids to
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't provide specialed
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
services to the level required by state
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
or federal law I'm pretty sure somebody
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
would have filed suit somewhere along
 
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
the way if you are from out of the
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
district say do uh well I don't know
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
maybe do send uh
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and you want to send your kid
 
01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
to co coob Brown northw Academy yes
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
there is an application process because
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
there are only so many seats available
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
in that school and it can't be wide open
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think for business
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
reasons the deal that we have with
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
Deerfield is they will take any and all
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
students and meet any and all students
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
where they are and comply with with all
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
laws so cobr Northwood Academy is a
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
public Academy it's not a traditional um
 
01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
public school so there are some
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
differences the fact that more than half
 
01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
the eighth graders in Deerfield want to
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
go to coob Brown Northwood Academy over
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
conquered high school or pemrick Academy
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
tells me all I need to know about
 
01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:05.719 align:start position:0%
accountability so we talk about account
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
accountability with the Statewide
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
assessment the Deerfield Community
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
School is below 50% proficient students
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
in English language arts mathematics and
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
science and has been for
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
years okay so I know my school is
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
underperforming in my opinion that's my
 
01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
opinion but that's what the the the test
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we all agreed on the assessment we
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
agreed we would use they don't meet the
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
bar year after year and so where's the
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
accountability where is the mechanism
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
that forces them to do
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
better when children choose a school and
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
families choose to send their child
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere that's the accountability
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
because their choosing that they're not
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
forced into it by ZIP code by the
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
address in which they live but because
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
they want to go there so I would say
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
that that this has the accountability in
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
that it forces no one to go
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere but allows for freedom of
 
02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
choice in
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
education I think I hit all your
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
questions and if I didn't I'd be more
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
than happy to to take them uh
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
individually thank you uh representative
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
um Bon quickly please we have three more
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
cards thank you Mr chair it is a very
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
brief question um why is it needed
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't any local District already put
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
this on the ballot as a
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
warrant thank you so thank you for the
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate it so this is
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
local enabling
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um and I so deerfield's a
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
little funny right so we don't have a
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
high school of our own and so we have to
 
02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
contract out for high school and so we
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
can either choose one size fits somebody
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
or school choice and we can decide on
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
the the size and scope of the school
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
choice my understanding is that if you
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a a high school uh to avoid to to
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
allow school choice like this I I
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
believe legislation is required to to
 
02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
allow it uh further this is letting the
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's letting the voters of a
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
school district uh decide their
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
self-determination if they want expanded
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
school choice in this this District
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
their District or not not the school
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
board uh not the executive board if it's
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
a if it's a you know larger District uh
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know an SAU comprised of other
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
districts um and so this is this is a
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle to to actually let the voters
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers decide for themselves
 
02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
how they'd like to proceed
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
forward thank you uh representative
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
Lakers I just have a really quick
 
02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:49.719 align:start position:0%
technical question sure on um
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
27 it just says where the student or the
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
educator are both not physically present
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you meant that
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
to be one or the other or
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
both because with the or it's I don't
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
know grammatically confusing did you
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
mean student and educator are both or
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
did you mean for it to be one or the
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
other yeah it it's it's probably an
 
02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
Andor um if one or both and and so um I
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
i' would be more than happy to work on a
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
friendly amendment to to correct that
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you the the question
 
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
and bringing it to my attention thank
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
you rent
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
thanks uh very much for bringing this
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
forward again um by the department of
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
education's own numbers the the the vast
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
majority of students in the fa program
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
were already attending private schools
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
or in home schools they didn't um just
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
exit their um their their Public School
 
02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
District but I was wondering in the um
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
in in your proposal here would the um
 
02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:01.639 align:start position:0%
would the the local property taxpayers
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
in that District be responsible for
 
02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
contributing that four five6 $7,000
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
which is the base plus the differentiate
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
to pay private school and um
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
homeschooling costs for kids already in
 
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
private and homeschool situations so
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um
 
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
so you have to be a member of the local
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
school district in order to uh qualify
 
02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
for a local EFA if a district um was to
 
02:03:36.510 --> 02:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
adopt this and so um just to go back to
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
deerfield's example for a minute right
 
02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
there was some wailing and nashing of
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
teeth about increased educational
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
cost because of kids coming out of
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
private schools and home school to now
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
attend apparently coob Brown Northwood
 
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
Academy we don't know those numbers
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
exactly because of privacy reasons but
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's fairly safe to to assume but those
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
children have now come back into the
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
public education system right so that's
 
02:04:06.239 --> 02:04:07.189 align:start position:0%
public education system right so that's
a

02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
win-win so yes if a district was to
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
adopt this and uh let's say I had my
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
kids attending a private school
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere right I'm my kids are in
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
public school but if my kids were were
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
were in private school and I lived in
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
Deerfield and they they hadn't graduated
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
high school or hit 21 um yeah the year
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
after this comes into into play or the
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
year of I guess um I could notify my
 
02:04:33.629 --> 02:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
local school district that I'm returning
 
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
my child to the to the local school
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
district taking them out of wherever
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
they were and putting them back in uh
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
and then Avail myself of the
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
EFA some people find that rather
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
problematic and and I I sense that you
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
do and and I don't don't I I find that
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
to be a joyous occasion and I guess it
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
comes down to what your perspective of
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
of public education is a lot of times
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
when people talk about public education
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
they're really referring to Public
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
Schools they talk about institutions not
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
students I believe public education is
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
the funding of a child's education using
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
public money a lot of districts force a
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
monopoly system based on home address to
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
the school that that allowed to be
 
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
attended so we we're making certain
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
families pay twice right so if I had if
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
I had my kids in private school I'd be
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
paying for my local public school first
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
I have to do that first that's my tax
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill legal obligation then if there's
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
money left over I can afford to send
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
them to private school right so I don't
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
I don't see the harm if a community
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
chooses right because we're not forcing
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
anybody if a community chooses to to
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
fund the education of all kids in their
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
Community out to high school age 21 uh I
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
I find that to be a win-win for for
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
families that in my view are are paying
 
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
twice but the short answer is yes
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
follow actually with the with the short
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
answer being being yes that that that
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
what what you're basically saying I just
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
want to confirm this that that um uh
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
family lives in Deerfield they they're
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
they've been sending their student to a
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
private school for years and years and
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
years no cost the Deerfield taxpayer
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
that with with if Deerfield were to
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
adopt these Provisions the Deerfield
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would be on the hook for five
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
six s $8,000 a year in those private
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
school tuition costs um well the only
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
place so on the whole I'll say yes your
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
your number estimates I don't agree with
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
because the state adequacy is is is
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
state but it also includes
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and it's both it
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
matches if if if that's yes thank you
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for the question uh
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
02:06:56.549 --> 02:06:56.559 align:start position:0%

02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
and bring this back thank you I
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time oh I'm sorry uh
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
this is the third time representative
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner the but the first model fiscally
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh didn't work out but this is the the
 
02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh didn't work out but this is the the
third

02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
third
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
bite thank um uh The Honorable marjerie
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
back

02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
maybe um we can do the three minute um
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
time for the uh remaining uh people who
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
testify of course thank you Mr chair and
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see your faces again I'm
 
02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to this bill um and I
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions that I don't
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
think were adequately addressed by the
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
presentation we just
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
heard um the first thing is it says very
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
carefully in the bill that um people are
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
not allowed to get both the education
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
tax credit scholarship and an the EFA
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship local scholarship in the
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
same school year and my question
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
is that does that mean that somebody
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
could get the EFA scholarship from the
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
state and then get twice the EFA
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship from The Local District and
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
if that's the case the amount of money
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about is closer to
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
$155,000 rather than just the six or
 
02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
seven we've been
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
discussing I'm also very concerned about
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
the vast Authority that the scholarship
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
organization has over everything in this
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill because the scholarship
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
organization is not answerable to the
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
voters in my community right now one of
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
our state reps is really hounding the
 
02:08:49.470 --> 02:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
school district with with Freedom of
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
Information requests on all sorts of
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
expenses nickeling and diming them to
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
death if this bill were to pass and if
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money was going to the
 
02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:04.589 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money was going to the
scholarship

02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
organization we would have no control
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
there would be no Freedom of Information
 
02:09:11.069 --> 02:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
acts that we
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
could the words not coming right we
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't ask them for information that
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
we can ask for our local school board
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
and local school
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
district it's giving up the authority
 
02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
over our tax dollars to a private
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
organization and I find that
 
02:09:31.679 --> 02:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
organization and I find that
troubling

02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:37.639 align:start position:0%
um there's part of the bill that says
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the uh EFA could not be reduced
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
from the first Year's amount so if the
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
first year the EFA is $10,000 but the
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
situation changes in the town and they
 
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
are no longer receiving the amount of
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
state A that they were in the past for
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the taxpayers of the
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
district are stuck paying that extra
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
because the person sending their kids to
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
private school would be guaranteed the
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
original figure no matter what the
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
school district did to cut their
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
costs It also says that differentiated
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
Aid would be added to the um base
 
02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
Aid would be added to the um base
adequacy

02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
the question I have on that is what
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
happens if the child who has the
 
02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:25.559 align:start position:0%
learning disability is miraculously
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
cured at this private school and no
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
longer needs the services are they going
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to get
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the extra Aid that they would have
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
received from the state if they still
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
had the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
disability if not then the state the
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to be paying for
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
that as
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
well as to the special education
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
services if a child's IEP it's says in
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that the local district is
 
02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:53.559 align:start position:0%
required to take care of the special ed
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
needs of the child so if a kid needs a
 
02:10:58.990 --> 02:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
one-on-one Aid and they're going to a
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
private school who hires that Aid who
 
02:11:01.719 --> 02:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
private school who hires that Aid who
evaluates

02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
evaluates
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%

question um twice in the New Hampshire
 
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
state constitution our assurances to me
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
as a tax beay that none of my tax
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
dollars would ever be used to support a
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
religious school or religious education
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
Twice first in the um Bill of Rights in
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
1787 and second later on in the late
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
1800s twice in in the Constitution I
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
have said that I have been promised that
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
my tax dollars would not go to pay for
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
Religious Education or religious schools
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
this program takes my tax dollars that
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
my husband and I struggle to pay our
 
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes every year takes my tax
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and sends it to the Christian
 
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
School up the road who teaches that the
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
Earth is 7,000 years old and I find that
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to accept thank you further
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you for your testimony what
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
know this bill is effective date of 60
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
passage further questions from the
 
02:12:49.599 --> 02:12:51.109 align:start position:0%
passage further questions from the
committee

02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
luno so thank you very much Mr chair um
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm guessing from what you said
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that your um your friends and
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
Neighbors in Hillsboro would not be very
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
excited about seeing their property
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
taxes go up to cover private school
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
tuition costs but but do you do you do
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
you you know do you think that may be
 
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
something similar in other you know
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
districts and towns across the state too
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
it would be and and one thing that's
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
troubling is that even if the town
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
decides to resend this program the
 
02:13:26.189 --> 02:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
children who are already involved in
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
that continue to get the scholarship
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
until they graduate from high school so
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
if the town backs out if Hillsboro
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
decided to do this and then realize two
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
years later it wasn't going to work and
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
we sended it all of the children that
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
are already receiving those scholarships
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
would continue to receive those
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
scholarships until they graduate from
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
high school so if there's five kids
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to get their $10,000 or
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
whatever until until they graduate from
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
high school um that's a lot of money
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
02:13:56.639 --> 02:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
Mr

02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
Trumble

02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
morning fine thank
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
you excuse me if you could press the
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
button thank you start over hi I'm David
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
FAL from the town of wear I oppose this
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill for a few reasons essentially I
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
think it's unconstitutional and it would
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
reduce funding for our local public
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
schools where 85% of our children go to
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
school the way I read it I think half
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
the money would come from the base
 
02:14:47.069 --> 02:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount from the state's coffers
 
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
and the other half would would come from
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
the local school district each of those
 
02:14:53.229 --> 02:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
I believe is unconstitutional this bill
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
basically says we're going to take the
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
money that's being spent on our local
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
public school and use it as an ATM
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
machine to fund any other educational
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
expense that it wants and there's
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
tuition materials computers and all
 
02:15:06.669 --> 02:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
things first of all just to go back the
 
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
state constitution says we have to fund
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
the public schools it doesn't say public
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
education it says public schools in the
 
02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution The Claremont case said
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to Prov an education to
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
every public school all the children in
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
the public schools not the private
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
schools the US Constitution does not
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
require funding Public Schools I talked
 
02:15:28.589 --> 02:15:28.599 align:start position:0%
about this last week chief judge
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
Robertson just last year said the state
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
need not subsidize private education the
 
02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
reason is this private schools don't
 
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
have to follow public rules if you want
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
public money you should follow public
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
rules Mr veral talked about special ed
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the C Brown Academy I assume they
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
follow special ed rules but when you
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
sign up for an EFA you sign away all of
 
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
your rights to special education rules
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
all out the door and we know that in the
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
EFA program 6% of the children are
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
special ed compared to 20% in the public
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
schools look at any of the websites of
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
the private schools to get millions of
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
dollars under EFA look at their policy
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
for non-discrimination what word is
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
missing disability they do not have any
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
rights in that area now that 50% of the
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
money that comes from the state that was
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
by Statute from court cases that led to
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
commissions it led to the education
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund it led to the defining of the
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
word adequacy that's required money that
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
goes to the Local Schools this bill says
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
well that's a nice ATM I'll just use
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
that to fund kids going off to private
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
schools that's unconstitutional taking
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
of money from a constitutionally derived
 
02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
fund where that money is to fulfill Our
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
obligation to have an adequate education
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
just because it's an educational expense
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it constitutional only the
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
Public School Educational expenses are
 
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional the other half of the
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
money comes from the local school
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
district and you say well that's local
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
money actually it's not local money The
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont 2 decision went back and
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
looked at the issue of the local
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
property tax so we in New Hampshire call
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
the local property tax and they said
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
this although the taxes levied by local
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
school districts are local in the sense
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
that they are levied upon property
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
within the district the taxes that are
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
in fact state taxes that have been
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by the legislature to the
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
fulfill the requirements of the New
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the taxes imposed
 
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
by the legislature for the support of
 
02:17:25.389 --> 02:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
schools are in their nature state taxes
 
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
the state half of this funding is also a
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
state tax that was set up to fulfill our
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation you can't take
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
that money and use it as an ATM to go
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional thank you very much are
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%

02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.830 align:start position:0%
there questions of Mr Trumble yes
represent

02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%

luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Trumble again for your
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
testimony are you saying that um that
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
State dollars are being used to pay
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
tuition bills at schools that
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students with um
 
02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.950 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students with um
special

02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
needs specic in reference to the efas
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
that is true the EFA program has no
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that a school that receives
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
that money follow the civil rights of
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
the state and specifically the one I
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
talked about was special ed when you
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
sign up for an EFA it's right on the
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
website where you sign up for it you
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
sign away a parent signs away their
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
rights under the federal special ed laws
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
so if you're not satisfied with that in
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
a public school you can complain you can
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
go to hearing you have a right to
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
special ed services in the private
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
schools in the EFA you have no rights
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to those Services thank you
 
02:18:38.669 --> 02:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli do you have a
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
question uh yes um in terms of an EFA
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
student going to a a private school uh
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where they sign away any
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
rights um because don't they have the
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
ability to at any point return to that
 
02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
private to the public school
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
and um reinstitute any services that
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for so I'm I'm not sure
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
where they're signing away any rights if
 
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
they attend the private school they have
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
to sign that they will not enforce their
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
federal education rights in that private
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
um maybe you could send me one of those
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
documents I'd Beed see I think it's
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
right on the the the state's website
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
where where the efas are set up it's
 
02:19:29.549 --> 02:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
says you you you may not keep your
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
rights you know I've you never heard of
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
an EFA uh student having a full right to
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
um special ed services and if that
 
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
weren't the case why are there 20% in
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
the public schools and only 6% in the in
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
the in the private schools follow up yes
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
um in that case why are there 6% EFA
 
02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
students going to a private school or
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
other educational options if they can't
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
get the services that they want for
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
their child thank you representative
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli that's a great question and I
 
02:20:01.870 --> 02:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
think the reason is this last week we
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on special ed there was a
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
parent who came in and she said I have
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
two children who have special ed needs
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
one of them she said is very inexpensive
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of them is very expensive I don't
 
02:20:13.469 --> 02:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
know if you remember that Mom who came
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
in and testified the inexpensive student
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
might only cost a couple thousand under
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
the EFA program you get the
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which is worth a
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
couple thousand so if that money
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
followed the student to the private
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
school that private school could afford
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
to pay those minimal services for that
 
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
student but any as this this moms words
 
02:20:36.429 --> 02:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
expensive special ed child would only be
 
02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
getting $2,000 to the private school if
 
02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh remember the special ed hearing
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
from last week the average expenditure
 
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
for special ed students in on top is
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
$28,000 per student student if you're
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
only getting a
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
$2,000 bonus if you will in the private
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
school through the EFA program you don't
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it leaves you $26,000 short so
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's why you have so few special Edge
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
students in the private schools and I
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
would imagine just from P math I've seen
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
we SE no evidence because there's so
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
little data from the AFA program but
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
probably the the 6% are that Mom calls
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
her inexpensive child further questions
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative penell yes thank you Mr
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:21:16.479 --> 02:21:18.349 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:18.359 --> 02:21:19.670 align:start position:0%
question
should

02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:21.270 align:start position:0%
should
we

02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
um create a new statute under the EFA
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
program requiring that all special Aid
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
money follow special Aid students so now
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
they don't no longer have to wave their
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
rights I mean we could just shift that
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
money we could just add it to the EFA
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
program correct and then all special Aid
 
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
students could get all the special
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
Aid all of their special aid needs
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
fulfilled wherever they go thank you
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative pet so you're suggesting
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that the EFA program would increase the
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid portion going there
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
to cover 100% of the cost of special ed
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
okay and I think you know conceptually
 
02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's fine but there's something that
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
has to happen before that you have three
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
bills in front of you to fully fund
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
special education in the public schools
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
those are the schools that under the
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution we have a constitutional
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
duty to spend the state has been
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
reluctant to fully fund special in the
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
public schools so once we do that in the
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
public schools then next year come back
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
and make that a bill and I would
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably support it but I can't see
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
doing that first and not fully funding
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
special ed in the public schools at the
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
state level does that make
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
sense okay represent
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you do you know if um
 
02:22:37.469 --> 02:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
private schools have to have to follow
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
the Americans with dis Disabilities Act
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
in other words do they have to have um
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
ramps if there's a child with a a
 
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
wheelchair bound or elevator or uh
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
special services like thatal I don't
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
know thank you representative Tanner I'm
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
not sure but I do know that I've done a
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
little research into the efas just to
 
02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
look at the schools that are getting
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
funds and I've noticed the word
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
disability is absent in their statement
 
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
on non-discrimination but I don't know
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
the answer to whether the Ada applies
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
house

02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay good morning chairman lad members
 
02:23:30.510 --> 02:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Deborah
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
house and I am here on behalf of
 
02:23:34.110 --> 02:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our 3700 members across
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the state uh to speak in opposition to
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
HB 1652 relative to establishing a local
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program uh we are opposed to
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
this because it would create a local
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
voucher program that could easily
 
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
decimate our local neighborhood Public
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
Schools as I have testified on several
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
different bills already the New
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution places a duty on
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state to provide and fund a robust
 
02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
public education system for all Granite
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
State children that would mean funding
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
local schools that in every District
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
across the state you can get individual
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
attention from a teacher support from
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
par Educators for your learning needs or
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs a school nurse a school
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
counselor to uh help you when you have
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
issues during the day until we have that
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
in every District across the state we
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be talking about any other
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
funding programs because that is
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
spending of Choice by the state or by
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
local governments so we need to take
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
care of those needs first this bill
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
would oblige local taxpayers to pick up
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
the tab for a second system of Education
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
based on families individual choices and
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
since there's only so much money you can
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
ring out of local property taxpayers who
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
support both the funding at the local
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
level and the state level with their
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
local property taxes or in Statewide
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes the creation of this
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
second system of Education would lead to
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
cutbacks in the constitutionally
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
required public education system and
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
those cutbacks come back and hurt our
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
students and I heard a previous
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
testifier talk about how the voucher
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
system is wildly popular there's about
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
5,000 students using the state vouchers
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's over 60,000 students using our
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
local neighborhood Public Schools so
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about roughly
 
02:25:29.309 --> 02:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
3% when you're comparing those numbers
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
we need to take care of the students
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
relying on our local neighborhood public
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
schools which is where most Grant State
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
families want their students to be able
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
to go to get a robust public education
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
and to be able to socialize with their
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
friends and Neighbors in their local
 
02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:47.710 align:start position:0%
friends and Neighbors in their local
schools

02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
um this local Voucher Program does not
 
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
have any limits on the income of the
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
families that can apply it means that
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
students who are already being
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or a p private school can
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
apply for a local voucher uh it means a
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
family that is struggling to meet their
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
bills and conquered would have to use
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
their property tax money to subsidize a
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
very well off family who wants to send
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
their children to St Paul's that's not
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
fair um he described this bill is
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
nothing by the Apple but remember the
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
Apple we're talking about is your local
 
02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer who is already
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
overburdened because the state has not
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
fulfilled its constitutional duty to
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
adequately and fairly fund all our local
 
02:26:35.309 --> 02:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood District Public Schools
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
poll after poll is shown that families
 
02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire want to see the
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislature improve and invest in our
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
local neighborhood Public Schools so all
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
our kids can succeed and Thrive Grand
 
02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
State families want quality stability
 
02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:48.990 align:start position:0%
State families want quality stability
and

02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
predictability which overall they get
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
from their public schools for all of
 
02:26:57.710 --> 02:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
those reasons we urge you to find HB
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
16532 in expedient to legislate and I
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions represent
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
dry yep thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
for coming can I ask again where a
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
voucher program is in statute I'm
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the only one and it says
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
repealed is there a that you can use for
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
this that matches the
 
02:27:23.269 --> 02:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
legislation it is government money that
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
is being used is tax money that is being
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
used to spend
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
for educational
 
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
choices that parents want to make if you
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
are redefining
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
it that is your choice to call it
 
02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
something else but I am going to call it
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
what it is it's a voucher
 
02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:49.230 align:start position:0%
what it is it's a voucher
further

02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
questions representa cordelli thank you
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of redefining things
 
02:27:57.269 --> 02:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't we according to your theory
 
02:28:04.030 --> 02:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
vouchers chair is that to this bill well
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
seeing vouchers not in the bill I think
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%

02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
much all right so we have no further
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this one so we're closing
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%

02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
basics in our Public Schools well that's
 
02:35:53.550 --> 02:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of this
 
02:35:57.070 --> 02:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
bill it does not change the components
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education under um
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
statute it merely says that English
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
language arts reading math science and
 
02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:07.630 align:start position:0%
language arts reading math science and
social

02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
social
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
studies should be the
 
02:36:12.190 --> 02:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
emphasis and but we should still pay
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
attention to all the other areas that
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
are currently in statute such as fizzed
 
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
World languages Arts Finance personal
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
finance um it wants to make a statement
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
that schools need to emphasize the
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
basics and um if you look at our
 
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores I think that that
 
02:36:38.830 --> 02:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
very well illustrates the need um about
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
15 minutes ago you each should have
 
02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
received in your emails a spreadsheet uh
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
showing math uh proficiency levels and
 
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
English language arts proficiency levels
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
for every school in the state um it's
 
02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
for every school in the state um it's
very

02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
instructive um um yes no not yesterday
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
Friday seems like yesterday um we had a
 
02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
a hearing on several uh funding bills
 
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
and um in in one in particular there was
 
02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:11.710 align:start position:0%
and um in in one in particular there was
new

02:37:11.710 --> 02:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets um that went through the uh
 
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
the towns and the schools and uh how
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
they would Faire under the formula one
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
of the examples was Alton Alton would be
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
sending back money to the state um let
 
02:37:30.349 --> 02:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
me just mention the proficiency rates in
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
Alton Alton Central School their
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
Elementary School math proficiency
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
25% English language arts
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
38% at their high school math is
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
27% and English language Arts
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
69% um I'll go to my own District
 
02:37:54.030 --> 02:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
Governor Wentworth School
 
02:37:56.349 --> 02:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
District English language arts
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency is
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
51% math proficiency is
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
43% and we are what is affectionately
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
termed a donor town or excess swept Town
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
um so we have a lot of room
 
02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
um so we have a lot of room
um

02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
and if you look at Tuftonboro is also
 
02:38:27.870 --> 02:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
very similar um town to wolfboro in
 
02:38:30.910 --> 02:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
terms of property values and so
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
forth these students go to the Kingswood
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
Regional Middle School Regional Middle
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%

02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
33% if you look at the kids from
 
02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
wolfboro who go to that same Middle
 
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
School 7th grade math is 40% and sth
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
grade reading is
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
39% um I I think this
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
illustrates the need um for concentrate
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
on the concentration on the basics I've
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
seen countless articles recently on um
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
businesses talking about trying to find
 
02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:19.389 align:start position:0%
businesses talking about trying to find
Qualified

02:39:19.389 --> 02:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
Qualified
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
employees um I've seen uh 40% 60% of
 
02:39:26.429 --> 02:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
businesses saying they can't find
 
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
quality uh employees to
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
hire in that line let me read a a note I
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
got from the chairman of our Board of
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro in recent months I have
 
02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
interviewed recent high school graduates
 
02:39:44.349 --> 02:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
for entrylevel carpentry jobs none could
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
read a tape measure or divide a number
 
02:39:49.150 --> 02:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
by two without using their
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
phone based on those two criteria I have
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
decided not to proceed any further with
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
interviews as the simple carpentry
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
techniques would be be far beyond their
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
level of
 
02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.190 align:start position:0%
level of
comprehension

02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not going to uh prescribe well
 
02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill anyway I'm not going to
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
prescribe um what has to be done to
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
improve those i' you know tried that I
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
tried that last year and um you know
 
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens this year but um
 
02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens this year but um
I

02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
think by stating that the emphasis has
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
to be placed on the
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
basics I think we can send a message um
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
to our New Hampshire schools but also to
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire parents that we
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
recognize the problems that we face and
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
we are trying to take action by telling
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
the schools they've got to pay attention
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
to these subject areas because without
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
these subject areas um what does our
 
02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:53.269 align:start position:0%
these subject areas um what does our
future

02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
hold thank you thank you very much are
 
02:40:58.349 --> 02:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
there any questions of Representative
 
02:41:01.150 --> 02:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli representative Miler thank you
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for bringing this
 
02:41:07.269 --> 02:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
forward uh isn't this bill the same bill
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
that was U that uh commissioner edel
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
blute brought before us two years ago
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
well I think it was actually um chairman
 
02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
lad brought it forward a couple of years
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
ago and I I believe it is different from
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
that bill how is it different um all
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
those the current subject areas still
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
remain as part of adequacy all we're
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
doing is saying that emphasis should be
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
placed on the uh the top four the basics
 
02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
a followup please yes so that would
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
still mean that the local school
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
district could determine exactly what
 
02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
the curriculum should be correct uh
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
correct and how they would uh emphasize
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
those subjects thank
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
you further questions representa
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you put
 
02:41:58.269 --> 02:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in um terms of the oldtime
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
ABCDEF um basis is it is it an a is it a
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
b is it a c d I think it's a different
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
measure along those lines there's cut
 
02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
scores determined for uh the four
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels and that's what it's
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
based on and so what's under proficiency
 
02:42:17.950 --> 02:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
what's the next level
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
um um I'm I'm not sure how they're
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
termed it's 1 two three and four levels
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
three and four I know are proficiency
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
and uh above profession thank you
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
represent Ry thank you and thanks for
 
02:42:42.510 --> 02:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question just humor me why
 
02:42:44.190 --> 02:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're still saying beginning in the
 
02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
school year 2008 8 2009 when it's
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
2024 I just um used current current
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
language from the statutes but uh we we
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh further questions represent
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman just
 
02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
represent thank you good morning good
 
02:43:09.469 --> 02:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
morning just a question in your dialogue
 
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um you're talking
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
about Al I'm assuming you're talking
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
about Prospect mountain when you're
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
talking about the high correct um you
 
02:43:18.510 --> 02:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
tell those towns that that uh uh Fund in
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
that area and you said that the excess
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
swep money is donor money um so I want
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
to know where where is the excess SW
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
money donated
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
to um I didn't know we had donut towns
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we don't anymore um so that's not
 
02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
true right excess sweat's not don't
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
right it was under the formula we were
 
02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
looking at Friday that um they would uh
 
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
be sending money back to the state and
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
they um they do have excess swept now
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
and yes thank you but this kind of
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
Friday dialogue we really don't have
 
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
excess SW Don anywhere the people the
 
02:43:58.830 --> 02:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
excess stays where it comes from is that
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct yes thank
 
02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
you brother represent
 
02:44:07.469 --> 02:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
Cornell I guess I'm confused does this
 
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
mean that you don't think that school
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
districts put the emphasis on English
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
math science and social studies in their
 
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
daily course
 
02:44:18.870 --> 02:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
subjects uh I I think
 
02:44:22.590 --> 02:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
that more has to be done to emphasize
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
those core core
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
subjects followup yes so what what do
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
you think they're doing because I spoke
 
02:44:33.710 --> 02:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
to my school superintendent after one of
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
the other bills last week and she said
 
02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
the emphasis in all Manchester schools
 
02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
is on the Core Curriculum of English
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
math science and social studies and
 
02:44:46.990 --> 02:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're fine they're they don't have to
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
do anything further to comply with this
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
bill who's going to Define it I'm
 
02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
leaving that to the local level I'm not
 
02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
going to prescribe you know additional
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
time requirements or anything like that
 
02:44:59.550 --> 02:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
I'm leaving that to the local school
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
district thank
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions
 
02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
represent cascaden um just a little bit
 
02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
off of that question is there a
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of school that is not focused
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
on emphasizing the core program I I have
 
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
not done any surveys so we don't
 
02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
know I I just I I know from the
 
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels um for all of our
 
02:45:24.429 --> 02:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
schools that we have to do more um
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're um far short of even State
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
targets for proficiency levels
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
percentages are there further
 
02:45:38.429 --> 02:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
questions yes repr
 
02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
leus I just have a quick
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
clarification level one is below
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
proficient level two is approaching
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
proficient proficient three is
 
02:45:51.630 --> 02:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you very much we have
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%

1691 uh we work with students about
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
30,000 of them across the state in many
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
districts um and they have a
 
02:46:51.630 --> 02:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a robust public
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
education this
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
bill the way it divides the um content
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
of an inadequate public education into
 
02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:02.469 align:start position:0%

02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
categories really seems to indicate that
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
one group is extremely important and
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
another group is less important and as
 
02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
we know when you divide things like that
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
what's extreme important gets
 
02:47:19.070 --> 02:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
funded what's less
 
02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:20.630 align:start position:0%
funded what's less
important

02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
is put to the side if you have time for
 
02:47:26.910 --> 02:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
it if you have money for it and we
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
already know we don't have money to make
 
02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
sure that all of our district schools
 
02:47:33.550 --> 02:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
are funded fairly and equally in this
 
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
state so that every student in the state
 
02:47:38.670 --> 02:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
has the same opportunity for robust
 
02:47:40.429 --> 02:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
public education where they can get
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
individual attention from the teacher
 
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:45.240 align:start position:0%

02:47:48.429 --> 02:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
counselor when they need it at school
 
02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
all these things I've been testifying
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
about over and over again the past not
 
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
even 3 weeks um we must ensure that
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
every child has a complete and robust
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
and engaging curriculum that builds
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
their minds body and character all
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
public school students deserve to learn
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
in their neighborhood Public Schools the
 
02:48:06.429 --> 02:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
academic content problem solving
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
critical thinking and teamwork skills
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
that will allow them to succeed in the
 
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
21st century economy AS Global Citizens
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
to do anything would be selling our
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
grand State citizens and their
 
02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:19.870 align:start position:0%
grand State citizens and their
communities

02:48:19.870 --> 02:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
short so for this reason we are opposing
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
this bill because all of
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
those areas listed in the current
 
02:48:32.190 --> 02:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate public education
 
02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
were important enough for this body
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
to decide to adopt them and there's
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
nothing there that can be J in our
 
02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
students need all of them but they also
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
need the funding so that they can be
 
02:48:49.469 --> 02:48:49.479 align:start position:0%
adequately instructed in them and have
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
learning experiences Hands-On learning
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
with them when it's
 
02:48:57.150 --> 02:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and be able to engage in
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
them none of them are unimportant and we
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be talking about
 
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores especially when we
 
02:49:05.790 --> 02:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
can't Define them put a letter grade or
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
numeric uh percentage on them because
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's putting the cart well before the
 
02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
horse if we're not funding all of our
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
schools so all of our students have the
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to learn and for those
 
02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
reasons we oppose HB 1691 I do have
 
02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I know it's a huge
 
02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
typo in the heading so I will send it by
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
email after um thank you and uh that's
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
the end of my testimony thank you very
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
much represent petel thank you Mr chair
 
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm just a little bit confused
 
02:49:41.469 --> 02:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
by your presentation of this
 
02:49:44.429 --> 02:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
um I've always operated with the
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
understanding when it comes to education
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
is that if you teach somebody to read
 
02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
write and perform basic math they can
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
essentially if they wanted if they were
 
02:49:55.229 --> 02:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
motivated could teach themselves
 
02:49:57.389 --> 02:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
anything they wanted and essentially you
 
02:49:59.510 --> 02:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
might not need a teacher if they were
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
highly motivated so if if you could you
 
02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
possibly spend an entire first second
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
third fourth grade on PE is that have
 
02:50:12.830 --> 02:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
the exact same equivalency of adequacy
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
as Reading Writing and basic math skills
 
02:50:17.309 --> 02:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
do you know of any school where they're
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
spending an entire first second third
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
and fourth grade on PE that doesn't
 
02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
strike me as anything that's happening
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
in any of our Public Schools certainly
 
02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
not anything I know of so it should be
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
part of every student's public education
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
because it
 
02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
is help health a healthy Habit to get
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
into it also helps sharpen the mind so
 
02:50:42.229 --> 02:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
they are better able to learn when they
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
are doing their core academic subjects
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
it um is part of an adequate
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
education so dropping it would be
 
02:50:56.229 --> 02:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
harmful to our students um and we should
 
02:50:59.630 --> 02:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
not be giving our students a Bare Bones
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
education they deserve to have an art
 
02:51:08.429 --> 02:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
education as well as learning how to
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
calculate how to you know read they they
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
should be able to read shakespare not
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
just read uh technical
 
02:51:20.070 --> 02:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
manuals our citizens in New Hampshire
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
deserve a full robust public
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
education they have that
 
02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:31.710 align:start position:0%
education they have that
right

02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:34.110 --> 02:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
follow it's possible you and I might
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
agree on something
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
um when I hear the the word adequacy MH
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
to me it actually kind of equates
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
barebones education so maybe we need to
 
02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
redefine

02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
redefine
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
um what a basic education
 
02:51:59.670 --> 02:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
is be because I I actually do find that
 
02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:02.030 align:start position:0%
is be because I I actually do find that
term

02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:52:06.429 --> 02:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of nebulous because Ade to me
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy adequate just adequate means
 
02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
just enough to get along in the world so
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
do you think maybe we need to change the
 
02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
term well the courts
 
02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
have through their findings in the
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
various Claremont cases and subsequent
 
02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
cases have um clarified that it is more
 
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
than just a barebones education so that
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
is where my understanding of adequate
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
being a robust education and that's why
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
I always refer to it as robust education
 
02:52:37.389 --> 02:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
because um it is far more than just
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
Basics you know living skills are a
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more um that is not what
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
public education in New Hampshire is and
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is not what the constitutional
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
guarantee is uh it comes from the the
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
various Court
 
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
findings further questions rep represent
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
leus oh okay in the wrong direction I
 
02:53:00.190 --> 02:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
understand that we need to look at money
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
I also understand that one of the things
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
that in life tends to be limited is time
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
and I know that students have limited
 
02:53:14.110 --> 02:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
time that they can spend in the day so
 
02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
my question is are you saying that all
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
things are equally important or should
 
02:53:23.229 --> 02:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
we perhaps
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
prioritize some things over others when
 
02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
we have limited time and we have to look
 
02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
at it look at all of it that was qu I
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
that I don't think you need to be doing
 
02:53:41.950 --> 02:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
that from this building thank
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
you was there a followup you ahead I had
 
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
a different question which is I was
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
wondering where it says that the lower
 
02:53:53.229 --> 02:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
important that is more a observation of
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
what the effect of of making two
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
categories like this we have seen how
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
that plays out thank you further
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
questions represent Tanner thank you and
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
business Community uh has made some
 
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
different statements about what kind of
 
02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:19.309 align:start position:0%
different statements about what kind of
uh

02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:22.750 --> 02:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
education experience that they really
 
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
want uh in order for people to be
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
workers in a complex world uh economy
 
02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:29.630 align:start position:0%
workers in a complex world uh economy
could

02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:54:34.229 --> 02:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
you could you just say some or do you
 
02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
have any information on what they expect
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
and why some of these other um topics
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
that are taught in public school are
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
important among other things the
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
business Community wants
 
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
students to you know graduate being able
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
to work well with a team being able to
 
02:54:59.469 --> 02:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
communicate clearly being able
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
to learn new skills
 
02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
and uh domains because it is a fast
 
02:55:12.349 --> 02:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
moving e economy what you train for now
 
02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
may not even exist as a field in 5 years
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
or 10 years or a new field May grow that
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
you are um going to have
 
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
to um transition into because it is a
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
whole new category that Springs up so
 
02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:28.670 align:start position:0%
whole new category that Springs up so
they

02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:55:32.349 --> 02:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
need lifelong Learners who are able to
 
02:55:35.229 --> 02:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
um work together and problem solve and
 
02:55:38.910 --> 02:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
be nimble and be always always looking
 
02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
for um ways to keep improving
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
themselves that's the Fe feedback that
 
02:55:46.710 --> 02:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
that we've
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
heard further questions representative
 
02:55:56.590 --> 02:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
question would you consider as you're
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
making these statements whether or not
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
we need to Define more carefully what it
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
means to be adequately educated in the
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
subject to which point I would point out
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
an example I worked as a carpenter one
 
02:56:18.190 --> 02:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
day we were framing houses
 
02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
and the boss told us to measure the
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
measure the frame and check it to see if
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
this uh Foundation area that we built
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
was square and one of the young
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
Carpenters said well how does that work
 
02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
and so he quickly explained you know two
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
right triangles you put them together
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
and his expression and I'm going to
 
02:56:41.309 --> 02:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
quote with one small
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
exception he explained you mean there
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's a use for that the vernacular is
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
a word I can't say but you understand
 
02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
02:56:54.990 --> 02:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
saying and he clearly had learned about
 
02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
triangles but he didn't learn how to use
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
triangles and so that my he didn't
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand that it was all part of an
 
02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of things by
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
shape so that is experiential learning
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
that it would be wonderful if we had
 
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
more opportunities to give our students
 
02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:16.590 align:start position:0%
more opportunities to give our students
that

02:57:16.590 --> 02:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:19.070 --> 02:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hands-On um practical
 
02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
application of you how to use
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge to do things I mean that's a
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
use of geometry for instance um
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
and that is something that is actually
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
um Competency Based learning when you
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to plan for it at a
 
02:57:47.309 --> 02:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
local level and coordinate it amongst
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
your departments and devise all sorts of
 
02:57:53.229 --> 02:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
um wonderful experiences for students
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
to explore and apply what they're
 
02:57:59.870 --> 02:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
learning it is really a great way to
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
reinforce and embed learning and do a
 
02:58:05.630 --> 02:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
lot of cross-curricular work but it is
 
02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
not something that can be done top down
 
02:58:11.469 --> 02:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
or by a broad statement or or by trying
 
02:58:14.070 --> 02:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
to Sho hornet in one size fits all
 
02:58:16.590 --> 02:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
across the state it has to be done you
 
02:58:18.590 --> 02:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
know either District by District or you
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
know in Cooperative districts up it it's
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:58:25.870 --> 02:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful way for students to learn
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
take a lot of professional time of
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
teachers and departments getting
 
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
together looking at what they're
 
02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
um create experiences where students can
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
and be applying it and exploring with
 
02:58:50.670 --> 02:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge so that next time
 
02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
they come across a
 
02:58:55.229 --> 02:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
situation they'll be able to use that
 
02:58:58.190 --> 02:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge again or or come across a s
 
02:59:00.190 --> 02:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
similar situation and apply it across
 
02:59:02.550 --> 02:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
other situations
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
so it's Hands-On stuff and it just it it
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
takes you know a lot of time to kind of
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make that first
 
02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
experience so then a student knows oh
 
02:59:18.910 --> 02:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
okay here's how I can use it again and
 
02:59:20.229 --> 02:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
again and
 
02:59:23.550 --> 02:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
again and it's I guess I'm just a little
 
02:59:26.910 --> 02:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
a former teacher y I'm a little skeptic
 
02:59:30.030 --> 02:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
is there a question there sorry I got
 
02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
talking pedagogy I apologize I I I think
 
02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
where we're going is we're getting to we
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
can talk pedagogy another time that this
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
can be done on the side yep um are there
 
02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:40.950 align:start position:0%
can be done on the side yep um are there
further

02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:59:43.710 --> 02:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much yep and
 
02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.790 --> 02:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
Trumble thank you Mr chairman I'm David
 
02:59:59.110 --> 02:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town
 
03:00:02.590 --> 03:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
aware I appreciate that this bill wants
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
to send a message and find ways to
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
improve our schools I think everybody in
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
this room does I don't think this is the
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
right way to do it though if you have a
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money and you start
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
spending more time on one thing you're
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to decrease time for
 
03:00:17.550 --> 03:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
something else so you say well what else
 
03:00:19.950 --> 03:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
could we do we could spend more money we
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
know that we're underfunding public
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
schools by $550 million that was the
 
03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
clear conclusion of the conval case what
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
would that look like more reading
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
specialists in our elementary schools so
 
03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
that young kids get that attention they
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
need so they can read and as the
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
question said once you learn how to read
 
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
then you can do lots of other things
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
smaller classroom sizes if you've ever
 
03:00:43.150 --> 03:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
been in elementary school or worked with
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
little kids 30 or 35 all day long is a
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
lot 20 or 25 is a lot better that
 
03:00:50.510 --> 03:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
requires more money we can get
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's objectives met
 
03:00:55.950 --> 03:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
but not by deemphasizing the other seven
 
03:00:57.790 --> 03:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
but rather by putting more resources in
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
so that everybody can do it and the
 
03:01:01.389 --> 03:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
question came up about Manchester
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're already doing this bill
 
03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
apparently but are there proficiency
 
03:01:06.150 --> 03:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
scores the model that we're going to
 
03:01:08.349 --> 03:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
have for the state is that the new bar I
 
03:01:10.990 --> 03:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't know let's look at these 11
 
03:01:15.150 --> 03:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
learning areas they are written in law
 
03:01:17.630 --> 03:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of the London Dair case said
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
you got to Define adequacy it came back
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
and there was a by Camal House and
 
03:01:24.030 --> 03:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bipartisan group came out of this
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee either unanimous or 19 to1 and
 
03:01:28.030 --> 03:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
went sailing through because everybody
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
agreed these 11 areas were important
 
03:01:33.710 --> 03:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
that was agreed upon by everyone the New
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution is not just the
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
basics the con Claremont 2 case
 
03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
specifically mentions beyond the basics
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
the social economics scientific
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
technological and political realities of
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
today knowledge of mental and physical
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
wellness grounding in the Arts cultural
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
and historical Heritage and academic and
 
03:01:56.670 --> 03:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
Vocational skills it's constitutionally
 
03:01:59.950 --> 03:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
required that all 11 of these areas be
 
03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
funded and properly educated why is that
 
03:02:04.469 --> 03:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these areas are all
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
interrelated there was a study of over a
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
thousand middle school students that
 
03:02:11.070 --> 03:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
studied the impact of music education on
 
03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
math and reading Professor burgie from
 
03:02:14.550 --> 03:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
the University Kansas School music
 
03:02:16.830 --> 03:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
wrotes this therefore if your school's
 
03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
goal rather is to educate the person to
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
develop the person's mind then you need
 
03:02:22.910 --> 03:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
to educate the whole person in other
 
03:02:24.910 --> 03:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
words learning may not be as modular as
 
03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
it is often thought to be music makes
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
reading and math better if you cut the
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
music programs Dow goes your reading and
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
math scores another thing this Cuts is
 
03:02:35.550 --> 03:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
computer skills the Federal Reserve Bank
 
03:02:37.389 --> 03:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
of Atlanta did a study of 40 million
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
jobs and determin that over 92% of jobs
 
03:02:42.910 --> 03:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
require digital skills if we're cutting
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
computer based based education under
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
this bill or attention to it or time
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
spent on it we're going to have students
 
03:02:50.590 --> 03:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
who aren't prepared for the future art
 
03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
is critical to self-expression it may be
 
03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
that one class that gets in student
 
03:02:56.469 --> 03:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
inspired to be in school for the whole
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
day world languages are key to
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
understanding people all over the world
 
03:03:01.469 --> 03:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
and being able to communicate with
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
people all over the world physical
 
03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
education it's key to your well your
 
03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
personal Wellness but it's also a place
 
03:03:09.190 --> 03:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
where we take the emphasis also off of
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
winning and put it onto access and
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
making everybody be welcome fed teaches
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
important values that need to be taught
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
as well we can't solve this problem by
 
03:03:21.150 --> 03:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
taking a small pie and making it smaller
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
for a lots of other skills the solution
 
03:03:25.229 --> 03:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
we all know it I think I maybe we don't
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
I think is to make the P bigger so we
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
can have better class sizes more reading
 
03:03:31.229 --> 03:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
specialist then we can meet the goal of
 
03:03:33.389 --> 03:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
this bill without cutting these other
 
03:03:35.910 --> 03:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
seven essential learning areas thank you
 
03:03:38.349 --> 03:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much
 
03:03:38.359 --> 03:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much
represent

03:03:41.990 --> 03:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
leas do you think that we
 
03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:48.910 align:start position:0%
leas do you think that we
could

03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize English Math Science Social
 
03:03:55.150 --> 03:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
Studies while teaching Arts World
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
languages physical education
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
Etc I think they're all interrelated yes
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
so how is this bill cutting those things
 
03:04:09.070 --> 03:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay what this is the problem I have
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the bill is is in the language let
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
me go to the bill it it's says right now
 
03:04:17.070 --> 03:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
the current okay the current bill just
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
has the initial language that says all
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
11 of these are what it means to have
 
03:04:24.229 --> 03:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy and we must meet all 11 the the
 
03:04:25.790 --> 03:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
new bill says that we're going to put
 
03:04:28.269 --> 03:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
emphasis on four and then for the second
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
group of 11 it says with attention to so
 
03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of what attention
 
03:04:36.510 --> 03:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
to means if a school says well we're
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to cut fizzed and we're going to
 
03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
cut financial literacy and computer
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
training and art uh and World Language
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
is by 50% we're still giving it
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
attention so that would be legally
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
acceptable under this bill and I think
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
that without additional resources if
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to spend more time on the
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
basics the the the four at the beginning
 
03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to take time away
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
so either you take time away from these
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
other seven or you put more money into
 
03:05:04.510 --> 03:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
the system so you have smaller class
 
03:05:06.269 --> 03:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
sizes more reading Specialists then we
 
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
can meet the goal of emphasizing these
 
03:05:11.790 --> 03:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
first four without taking it out of the
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
other seven
 
03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
I got a question for you yes Mr chairman
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at numbers one two
 
03:05:21.389 --> 03:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
three and four are subject content areas
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
there do you think by doing this that
 
03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any more attention
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
given to science and social studies due
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
to the fact we only have a Statewide
 
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
assessment for the top
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
two um is the Statewide assessment part
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
of our issue here that we have that
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
driving the ship that's what people are
 
03:05:43.389 --> 03:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
held accountable for that's what we look
 
03:05:45.229 --> 03:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
at achievement and based that on and
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
growth on we had
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
testimony last
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
year from um from
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
Nea that there's a problem we have with
 
03:05:59.469 --> 03:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
Civics education and social studies
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of that in our schools
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
today so by doing this are we going to
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
see any improvements if we don't a
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely look at how we're assessing
 
03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
and where we are putting the emphasis in
 
03:06:15.229 --> 03:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:16.670 --> 03:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that's a great
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
question um I I do agree we only test I
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
think those two areas so that's the only
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
area that you can have some data from
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
that gives you longitudinal you know
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
over the years but as people point out
 
03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
the the proficiency standard is an
 
03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
arbitrary one that's doesn't isn't
 
03:06:36.190 --> 03:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
really set in stone I I think all of
 
03:06:38.190 --> 03:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
these 11 areas I'm not against spending
 
03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
time on the top four I'm saying if you
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
got a teacher who's got 35 children in
 
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
their class classroom it's really hard
 
03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
to help Johnny who's having a hard time
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
reading if you got 34 other children if
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
you can have a reading Specialist or
 
03:06:53.070 --> 03:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
smaller class sizes those children are
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to learn the basics better and
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
then we can have all of the education
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
every subject gets better but but saying
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend less time on these
 
03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
other seven I think would be to the
 
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
detriment of the children oh don't
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstand me I'm not trying to say
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
that I I understand that um if I asked
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
an elementary kid their favorite course
 
03:07:15.750 --> 03:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to say
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
recess and that's
 
03:07:24.190 --> 03:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
number not even a number um so no recess
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
is not physical education physical
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
education they come in and they have I
 
03:07:30.269 --> 03:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
understand that I have a PE teacher as a
 
03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
wife okay it's a valuable it's a really
 
03:07:36.670 --> 03:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
valuable part of the day of Education I
 
03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
just don't think we should be cutting
 
03:07:40.590 --> 03:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
these other seven or deemphasizing them
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
or saying just attention is good enough
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I think we should go back to what this
 
03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee did when they wrote the
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy law stick with all 11 they're
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
all important and if we're not happy
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
with the big four spend more money on
 
03:07:53.950 --> 03:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
our schools smaller class sizes more
 
03:07:56.309 --> 03:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists that's a better way
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
to solve the problems that were
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.630 --> 03:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
hearing I'd have a comment it's not a
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
question though but I I I I will say it
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
03:08:10.590 --> 03:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
are we have these 11 areas is that I
 
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
consider part of an adequate education
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
which I also feel they all need
 
03:08:24.030 --> 03:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
emphasis um do you think
 
03:08:27.389 --> 03:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
by do you think which Weir that well I I
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
guess I I'm trying to address the issue
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
of our music our theater programs our
 
03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
art programs and many parents send their
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
kids to schools like we do when we
 
03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
tuition our high school kids out of
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
pymont they choose Oxo across the the
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
river in Bradford Vermont because of
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
their theater program and because of
 
03:08:50.349 --> 03:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
their athletic
 
03:08:50.359 --> 03:08:52.030 align:start position:0%
their athletic
program

03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:08:54.229 --> 03:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
so so I guess in what I'm trying to
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
saying um would you believe that I
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
believe that all 11 of these are just as
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
important you think are you saying do I
 
03:09:05.469 --> 03:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
believe all 11 are equally important
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
well do you believe that I believe do I
 
03:09:09.229 --> 03:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
believe that you believe other words do
 
03:09:11.550 --> 03:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
I make my point I I'll go with that yes
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any further
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions this concludes we have no more
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
cards so it's lunchtime we will close
 
03:09:24.910 --> 03:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
this hearing and come back at the
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
prescribed time which
 
03:09:26.800 --> 03:09:35.670 align:start position:0%
prescribed time which
is

03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:38.269 --> 03:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
12:45 and this afternoon we got bills
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%

I was walking over here to
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%

03:49:38.319 --> 03:51:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:51:20.149 --> 03:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%

epip pin it's back on the back table
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
right now if you did not get a
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
copy from the MD
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
people yeah
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
yep okay so what we're going to do right
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
now we're going to jump right into 1493
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to the powers
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
and duties of the Cooperative School
 
03:51:48.910 --> 03:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
District budget committees we've been
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
there and done this before and we're
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to do it again uh representative
 
03:51:53.120 --> 03:52:03.189 align:start position:0%
going to do it again uh representative
spillsbury

03:52:03.189 --> 03:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
chairman well
 
03:52:12.510 --> 03:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think if we didn't regularly have a
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
rotation of new Representatives you know
 
03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
who don't know past
 
03:52:20.590 --> 03:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
history we'd lose a lot of the drama
 
03:52:23.950 --> 03:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and members uh
 
03:52:25.750 --> 03:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
I've been a a guest of the education
 
03:52:28.030 --> 03:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee the last two weeks and I hope
 
03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
I don't overextend my welcome this
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon because I'm going to come up
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
on four bills well it's interesting note
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
your bill has a little over 10 lines in
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
it of which you've asked for 10 minutes
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
well I think I can probably do this the
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
way we work is the prime sponsor as much
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
time as they need you don't I'm leaving
 
03:52:48.030 --> 03:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
time for
 
03:52:51.389 --> 03:52:51.399 align:start position:0%
questions the bill is very simple the
 
03:52:54.149 --> 03:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
current statute to
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
1952a says that the Cooperative school
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
budget committee shall have the powers
 
03:53:01.950 --> 03:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
and duties of Municipal budget committee
 
03:53:04.030 --> 03:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
32 in so far as the budget for the
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district is
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
concerned now that sounds fairly
 
03:53:14.349 --> 03:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
sweeping to me and I think if you read
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
it casually you would assume that it's
 
03:53:18.750 --> 03:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's therefore implied that absolutely
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
everything having to do with
 
03:53:24.910 --> 03:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
spending but as it turns
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
out school districts are being Guided by
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
their Municipal attorneys that that
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
means that the school budget committee
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
only has to be involved with the
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
formation of the budget
 
03:53:41.469 --> 03:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
itself so my Amendment adds a new
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
sentence Additionally the committee
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
shall review and evaluate any warrant
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
articles or supplemental Appropriations
 
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
involving the expenditure of funds not
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
previously authorized no warrant
 
03:53:53.950 --> 03:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
articles shall be printed on the annual
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
town meeting Ballot or special meeting
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
ballot without approval by the
 
03:54:00.630 --> 03:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
committee I hope this is
 
03:54:00.640 --> 03:54:02.590 align:start position:0%
committee I hope this is
noncontroversial

03:54:02.590 --> 03:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
noncontroversial
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
the essence of it is to say that
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
any um motion
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
special appropriation warant article
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
that involves spending funds that are
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
not previously authorized would have to
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
go through the budget committee and the
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
budget committee would have to evaluate
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
it express their opinion and that that
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
would then be disclosed when the warrant
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
was being considered by the
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
voters um I would have thought as I said
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
that that an amendment like this
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be needed but I've listened to
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
the um opinions of Council to Fall
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
Mountain I won't mention his name but he
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
is highly regarded as arguably the
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
foremost Municipal attorney in the state
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
practicing with the
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
districts um and his guidance
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
is nope warrant articles special
 
03:54:58.269 --> 03:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
spending measures
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
supplementals the question that came up
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
fall was how will the funds be used that
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
were the result of the increases to
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid authorized by the
 
03:55:15.630 --> 03:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
legislature in June in
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
hb2 and at the public hearing I was
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
offered the opportunity for the first
 
03:55:23.870 --> 03:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
question and I held back on any
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
commentary about what was being proposed
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
what was being proposed was to take the
 
03:55:33.070 --> 03:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
bulk of the funds and uh PVE repay the
 
03:55:35.189 --> 03:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
parking lot and driveway at the high
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
school my question was where does the
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee stand on
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
this and I was told the budget committee
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't been consulted and I asked why
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
and that's when we got the opinion and
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
then backed up by the opinion of the
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
council that the statute didn't require
 
03:55:58.269 --> 03:55:58.279 align:start position:0%
it now as a very technical matter I
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
forget the citation but it's in
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
195 I went back that evening and read
 
03:56:04.349 --> 03:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
the statute very
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
closely and I then wrote a memo to the
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
school district arguing that in fact
 
03:56:12.429 --> 03:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
even for those kinds of
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
supplementals um the budget committee
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
does you can't bypass the budget
 
03:56:19.510 --> 03:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee but it's an ambiguous area of
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
law it doesn't make it absolutely clear
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make it clear that it
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
involves other
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
situations than the kind that
 
03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
occurs when the state legislature sets
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
the state budget after the district
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
budgets have been set in
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
March and so um I I'm willing to take
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
any questions this is just simply a good
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
governance uh measure in a district
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
where the voters have adopted a formal
 
03:56:54.429 --> 03:56:54.439 align:start position:0%
budget committee that budget Committee
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
in my opinion needs to be involved in
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
every new spending
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
matter thank you very much are there
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:03.349 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
03:57:07.149 --> 03:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
you very much representative spillsbury
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
for joining us this afternoon
 
03:57:15.070 --> 03:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
um uh in my uh in my you know 12 years
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
on the Hopkinson School Board um
 
03:57:20.830 --> 03:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
obviously we had a number of um worn
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
articles and and um with respect to
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds uh uh some more in
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
articles that actually created capital
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
reserve funds and so my question
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
is when a um when a capital reserve fund
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
is created by the voters um at the uh
 
03:57:41.950 --> 03:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know at the school district or at
 
03:57:45.630 --> 03:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
the town meeting um you know on a on a
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
on a warrant article and the capital
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
reserve fund gives let's say the school
 
03:57:55.389 --> 03:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
board sole authority to expend uh monies
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
from this fund given deposits from that
 
03:58:01.389 --> 03:58:01.399 align:start position:0%
fund are still subject to to approval by
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
the budget or recommendation by the
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
budget committee and and a vote on the
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
warrant but talking about expending from
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve fund would would
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
would this proposal run you know
 
03:58:15.630 --> 03:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
essentially conflict with um with
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
existing um voter approved uh capital
 
03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:20.630 align:start position:0%
existing um voter approved uh capital
reserve

03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
03:58:23.510 --> 03:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
funds so let me make sure that I
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
understand the distinctions you are
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
making um I'm very familiar that with
 
03:58:30.269 --> 03:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
with the kind of Warrant articles you're
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
talking about and it typically Fall
 
03:58:35.110 --> 03:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
Mountain would have warrant articles to
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
expend from existing reserves town by
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
Town typically five plus a sixth one for
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
the high school and then they would have
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
another W article that gets to the
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
question of whether any surplus funds
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
might be deposited to the I would I
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
would contend that every one of those
 
03:58:57.070 --> 03:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
should be reviewed by the budget
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee so that the budget committee
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
can register its opinion before the
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
voters are called upon to to
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
vote but that doesn't you know once a
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
warrant article has been approved
 
03:59:14.110 --> 03:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh to take $35,000 out of the such and
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
such U Reserve fund for you know secure
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.469 --> 03:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
reapprovals go ahead um so my my
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
question though is if a uh if a school
 
03:59:30.990 --> 03:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
district um uh such as Fall Mountain had
 
03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve fund for you know
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
facilities and maintenance or something
 
03:59:38.670 --> 03:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
like that um that was and and that fun F
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
was created years before at a um at a
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know at a school district meeting
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that fund was created was you know
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
on the on the warrant and the
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
description of that fund gave the school
 
03:59:58.990 --> 03:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
board um sole discretion for expending
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
fund would would would this language
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
here conflict with that because now it's
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
saying that the school board does not
 
04:00:11.429 --> 04:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
have sole discretion that it would um
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
still have to go to the budget committee
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
first okay you're raising a question I
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
hadn't contemplated I'm not aware that
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
there are uh warrant articles worded in
 
04:00:24.670 --> 04:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
the way that you said but I would say it
 
04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
overrides that that certainly would be
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
my intention in other words fact that
 
04:00:29.560 --> 04:00:30.429 align:start position:0%
my intention in other words fact that
there's

04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
$300,000 currently held in reserve isn't
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
the question of the warrant article
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
you're describing the question is
 
04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
whether the 35 $5,000 will be taken out
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
for a given purpose right and I would
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
say that we need to make sure the budget
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
committee is part of the evaluation and
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
that their opinion is expressed and made
 
04:00:52.149 --> 04:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
known to the voters before the voters
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
make an informed
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
decision represent
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
04:01:00.750 --> 04:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm on both the
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
school Municipal budget committee and
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
our work basically is from the fall up
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
until the time the budgets are said in
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
January February early February and
 
04:01:15.630 --> 04:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
after that we aren't involved in the
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
expenditure process until the following
 
04:01:20.429 --> 04:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
year because we're a budget committee
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
a a legislative oversight committee or
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say we're not
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
like um Vice school board or vice M you
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
know Selectmen we don't tell the
 
04:01:37.149 --> 04:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
Selectmen I mean they have they have
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds that are for fire
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
engines that sort of thing and and um
 
04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
but the school often has Capital funds
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
for facilities and and they'll have a
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
capital reserve for special education
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's more it's not as specific as the
 
04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
municipal one is
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
um does your in this bill do you expect
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee will
 
04:02:05.229 --> 04:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
be involved in in all the decisions
 
04:02:09.070 --> 04:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole year no no it's not
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill to
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
involve um the budget Committee in
 
04:02:14.800 --> 04:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
involve um the budget Committee in
actual

04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
actual
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
spending it's the authorization of
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
spending it's the appropriation process
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's what occurs leading up to any
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
decision that the voters would have to
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
make right so we know that that's at the
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
least an annual budget cycle with a
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
February deliberative if you're SP2 town
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
and uh March ballot but the point of the
 
04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to make sure that that
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
also is uh enforc his to Warrant
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
articles and supplemental Appropriations
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
a supplemental appropriation is entirely
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
different than how the money is then um
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
administered and spent once the
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation has has
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
occurred yes so you know we're on suvin
 
04:03:08.429 --> 04:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
County um and we actually come in and as
 
04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
the representatives and do what you're I
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
think what you're uh proposing that we
 
04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
come in sometimes for the Commissioners
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
if they're making an expenditure that we
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
we kind of approve and but there's a
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
bottom to it so it isn't like we're in
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
they want to spend you know $200 on
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
something uh a new curtain in a uh a
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
classroom or something or um you know
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
with the with the county with we have a
 
04:03:38.309 --> 04:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
certain level and I don't see any level
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
in this bill where it seems like uh you
 
04:03:44.189 --> 04:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
know you would say expenditures over
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
20,000 or over 50,000 something like
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
that but you know you're talking uh what
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
were you talking $33,500 for a parking
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
lot that that you want to get down to
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
that granular level is that your
 
04:03:56.760 --> 04:03:58.389 align:start position:0%
that granular level is that your
intent

04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
intent
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
no I don't think you and I
 
04:04:02.349 --> 04:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner are saying
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
anything differently we just need to to
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
find the distinction between what we're
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
saying we're not in Conflict I don't
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
believe uh the parking lot proposal by
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
the way was a couple
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so again once monies have been
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
authorized through the adoption of a
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
budget through the adoption of a warrant
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
article or through the adoption of a
 
04:04:27.560 --> 04:04:29.149 align:start position:0%
article or through the adoption of a
supplemental

04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
supplemental
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation that role of the budget
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee is done as to that expenditure
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about how does an
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
expenditure get made
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
after uh an amount is authorized but you
 
04:04:43.590 --> 04:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
and I have sat together on the Sullivan
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
County EFC and uh it's the same sort of
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
process the the EFC and the delegation
 
04:04:50.159 --> 04:04:50.990 align:start position:0%
process the the EFC and the delegation
gets

04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
budget the authorization of how arpa
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
funds would be
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
spent um the question of bond issues and
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
authorizing but once the authorization
 
04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
decision has been made the delegation is
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the Commissioners in the
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
administration the same thing that I'm
 
04:05:15.149 --> 04:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
talking about here once the
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
authorization decision has been made the
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
voters have spoken then beyond that
 
04:05:22.510 --> 04:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
point is what you're describing and
 
04:05:24.309 --> 04:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
beyond that point is what this bill does
 
04:05:24.319 --> 04:05:26.630 align:start position:0%
beyond that point is what this bill does
not

04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
reach further questions represent
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this is
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
a Sullivan County discussion
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
apparently um I just wanted to inquire
 
04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill is specific to Cooperative
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
School District budget committees is
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
there statute that uh is similar to this
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
for other School District budget
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
committees that aren't
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative well I'm going to defer to
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
The Experts here but my understanding of
 
04:06:02.429 --> 04:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
the law is that where there is a school
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
district entirely within uh the
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
geographic confines of a particular
 
04:06:11.550 --> 04:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
municip ality then it's
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
3214 that governs the creation of a
 
04:06:17.149 --> 04:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee and includes
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
authority to deal with the school budget
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
through the same entity it's only when
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
you get to a Cooperative School District
 
04:06:26.830 --> 04:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
that you then refer to RSA
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
195 and there's sort of a confusing link
 
04:06:34.269 --> 04:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
between 3214 and 195 but uh um so that's
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
why I've addressed Cooperative school
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
districts I've also found
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
I have some bills before Municipal and
 
04:06:43.349 --> 04:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
County and we get into this thing here
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature where uh bills
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
relating to the municipal governance are
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
delegated to one committee and those
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
that relate to the schools and other and
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
then every once in a while we look at
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
unsure further
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
bbon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
pertains to line nine on your bill where
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
it says no warrant article shall be
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
printed on the annual town meeting
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
Ballot or special meeting ballot without
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
approval by the committee um I'm
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
confused by that does that mean that the
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee has to approve of the warrant
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
article before it's even printed because
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
I know in my budget there's a space
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
where it says you know the town budget
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee um approves this or or or
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't um so sometimes the budget
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't approve it but it
 
04:07:41.469 --> 04:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
still is printed on the
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
ballot yeah I think that's a very good
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
question um that sentence is a product
 
04:07:49.229 --> 04:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
of my work with
 
04:07:51.910 --> 04:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
OS and I think it could be
 
04:07:51.920 --> 04:07:53.870 align:start position:0%
OS and I think it could be
improved

04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
improved
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh my intention wasn't that the budget
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee could stop something from
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to the voters but rather that the
 
04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
budget committee had to be
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
consulted had to have an opportunity for
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
Meaningful um
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
consideration and then would express its
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
opinion and in fact I believe when I
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
sent my uh LSR
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
request I stipulated that the vote of
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
the budget committee would be printed on
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
the warrant and I I I actually think
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
that that would be u a worthwhile thing
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
to add so perhaps the question you're
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
asking should be
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
clarified and in the same course perhaps
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
you'd consider putting in the
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
stipulation that the um determination
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
the vote of the budget committee is
 
04:08:47.920 --> 04:08:49.389 align:start position:0%
the vote of the budget committee is
[Music]

04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:54.750 --> 04:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.870 --> 04:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
there yeah it
 
04:08:57.880 --> 04:09:00.109 align:start position:0%
there yeah it
is

04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I further
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.309 --> 04:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
Christina thank you chairman lad good
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
Barrett Christina from the school boards
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are opposed to uh
 
04:09:29.109 --> 04:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
1493 um a couple aspects um in existing
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
law that I want to hopefully provide
 
04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
some clarification for the uh for the
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee um relative to the the the
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
budget committee's um
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
authorization um we know that RSA
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
195 12a the budget committee this is
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 says the Cooperative School
 
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
District budget committee shall have the
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
powers and duties of the municipal
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
budget committee under the provisions of
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 in so far as the budget for the
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district is concerned
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
and in so far as RSA 32 is applicable to
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative School District budget
 
04:10:08.910 --> 04:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
so that statute about the budget the
 
04:10:11.229 --> 04:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
bill brings other sorts of expenditure
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
special warrant articles expenditures
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
from capital reserve funds so on and so
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
forth I'll come back to that in a minute
 
04:10:19.870 --> 04:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
as well too but we know that excuse me
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
um Cooperative School District budget
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
committees operate similarly to as they
 
04:10:25.149 --> 04:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
do under Municipal budget committees
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
under RSA 32 RSA 32 colon 16 the duties
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
and authority of the budget
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
Committee in any town which has adopted
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the subdivision that
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
also means School District as well too
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
the budget committee shall have the
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
following duties and responsibilities to
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
prepare the budget as prepared in RSA 32
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
col 5 um and if authorized under s SP2
 
04:10:52.269 --> 04:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
default budget for submission to each
 
04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
annual or special meeting of the voters
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the municipality so under RSA 32 the
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee's responsibility is
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
limited to the budget your operating
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
budget which we know goes on warrant as
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
a separate warrant article it's separate
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
from a a special warrant article if
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
you're trying to raise an appropriate
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to do the roof for the the
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
parking lot or whatever it might be um
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
we also have another bill um that was in
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County house bill I
 
04:11:21.109 --> 04:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
believe it's 11:05 which is looking to
 
04:11:23.710 --> 04:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
clarify the definition of the budget but
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 colon 3 has a very specific
 
04:11:29.710 --> 04:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
definition of what the budget is so we
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
know that under 32 both the mun both the
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
bucom statute tying it back to the
 
04:11:36.189 --> 04:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
definition of the budget the budget
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
committee's responsibility is only the
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
budget relative to um the comments um
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
that um the representative made um about
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
the bucom um sort of reviewing this or
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
making making a notation of whether or
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
not they support the expenditure or
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't don't support the expenditure this
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
is RSA 32 colon 5 paragraph
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
5 when any when any purpose of
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation submitted by the governing
 
04:12:07.630 --> 04:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
body or by petition appear in the
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
warrant as part of a special warrant
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
article the article shall contain a
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
notation of whether or not the
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation is recommended by the
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
governing body and if there is a budget
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
committee a notation of whether or not
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
it is not recommended by the budget
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee so the the the withdrawal from
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve fund is kind of a
 
04:12:29.070 --> 04:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
different animal but if you have a a
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
budget committee if your community in
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
your school district has adopted a
 
04:12:33.550 --> 04:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee the budget
 
04:12:35.309 --> 04:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't prepare the special
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
warrant articles but they're still
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
giving an notation to the voters of
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not the bucom supports or
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
does not support raising money for that
 
04:12:46.030 --> 04:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
particular purpose so um I I don't think
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the bills is necessary I think some
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that the prime sponsor
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
spoke about the budget committee already
 
04:12:53.950 --> 04:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
has authority to do and terms of putting
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
their notation on on the article whether
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
or not the budget committee supports it
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
or doesn't support it we would um
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
significantly object to the to the
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
provision specifically about the bill
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
about having to get budget committee
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Authority um to withdraw money from the
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund um this is RSA 35
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
col 15 and representative luno you
 
04:13:16.349 --> 04:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
talked about it that often times the the
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
school board or the or the select board
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
is name sort of Trustee of the of the
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
trust funds and is given given authority
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
to expend that money depending on how
 
04:13:26.670 --> 04:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
the language of the create of the of the
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
trust was created and the warrant
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
article was was worded whenever 30 years
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
ago whenever that may have been but it
 
04:13:35.429 --> 04:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
says persons holding uh said capital
 
04:13:38.109 --> 04:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
reserve funds and Trust as provided in
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall hold the same until
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
such time as the town District or County
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
shall have voted to withdraw funds from
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve fund so the
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
authority to withdraw is is to some
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
degree already put in the hands of the
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
voters when they've determined whether
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
or not it's going to be the school board
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
or the trustee of the trust funds or
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
whoever the voters have decided is given
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
um authority to um to expend from that
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
trust fund um I guess the other aspect
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
from a sort of a practical aspect um you
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
know the budget committee is looking at
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
sort of future expenditures if you will
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
next year's budget next year's
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations the capital reserve fund
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
that money has already been appropriated
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
the voters have already have already
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated that and put it in this
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
place as a a savings account if you will
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
for special ed cost Transportation cost
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
tuition cost facilities cost whatever it
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
might be so the voters have already
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
authorized that money being expended
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's just sitting in again essentially a
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
savings account right now until the
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
school board or whoever is given
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
authorization to expend determines that
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we need the roof or we need to buy
 
04:14:39.149 --> 04:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
a bus or whatever it might be so um I
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
think those uh conclude uh nhs's uh
 
04:14:44.109 --> 04:14:44.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to happy to answer
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
have so if the um Co-op has a Special
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
Reserve account for catastrophic Aid and
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
you have small small district and all of
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
a sudden you have this huge you know
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
costing Factor come in with a student
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
which happens
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
yep what would be the steps for getting
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
that money out of that account yes so
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative I'll
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I I was digging
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
through RSA 35 over the weekend um to um
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
to to sort of prep myself and and and
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
review I haven't looked at the statute
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
in a while um but often times as I
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
believe representative luno referred to
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
when the trust is created you can put
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
Lang and it's created via warrant
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
article the voters have to have to vote
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
on and it's not just like it it just
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
appears the voters are approving this I
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
believe there's language in usually in
 
04:15:36.990 --> 04:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
in in the warrant article that gives the
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
School Board specific authority to
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
expend that money when the school board
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
deems it necessary and there are
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
certainly reporting requirements coming
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
out you know it has to be I believe it
 
04:15:47.710 --> 04:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
has to be included in the annual report
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
the school board is obviously going to
 
04:15:51.149 --> 04:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
discuss that at a public meeting so it's
 
04:15:53.309 --> 04:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
not like it's being done in the dark or
 
04:15:55.950 --> 04:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
or in any non-transparent manner it's
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
going to be full and open process for
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
the school board to determine whether or
 
04:16:00.670 --> 04:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
not they want to withdraw that money
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
from the reserve fund for again whatever
 
04:16:05.710 --> 04:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
purpose the school board deems deems is
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
necessary under the the constraints of
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
the trust and how the trust is worded
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions not see any further questions
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
on this thank you very much thank you
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
might represent Pillsbury spillsbury I
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
mean do you do you have your hand
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think much of the discussion has been
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
a red hering it's off Target what this
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
line what the Bill's Amendment language
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
says is warrant articles or supplemental
 
04:16:50.349 --> 04:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations involving the expenditure
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
of funds not
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
previously authorized so we're only
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the process that leads to
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
the authorization not the process of how
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
money is spent after the
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
authorization thank
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:08.109 align:start position:0%
authorization thank
you

04:17:08.109 --> 04:17:08.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any pink cards other pink
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
cards on 1493 we'll close this hearing
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
and we will go into the next one which
 
04:17:16.600 --> 04:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
and we will go into the next one which
is

04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
1642 relative to the role of the Cooper
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
School District Board member
 
04:17:24.269 --> 04:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives on a School District
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee and once again uh
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
chairman well this is very efficiently
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled one after another thank you
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
for that uh this is an extremely simple
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
Bill current law says that there will be
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
a ex officio member of the budg of the
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District's budget
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee from the school
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
board with all powers and duties of any
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
other member of the committee which of
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
course includes the right to
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
vote so the bill simply changes the
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
school board members participation to
 
04:18:15.389 --> 04:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
that of an ex oficio non- voting
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
capacity so
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
why it's very
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
interesting in Fall Mountain again to
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
use the example that's home to
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
me we have five towns each pre-existing
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
district has a
 
04:18:34.109 --> 04:18:34.119 align:start position:0%
representative there are a school board
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
member there are two at Large and so
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's a total of seven and uh many
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
votes are decided on 43 basis an odd
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
number I think is pretty much the scheme
 
04:18:50.109 --> 04:18:50.119 align:start position:0%
in every school
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
board but the budget committee statute
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
says that the budget committee will be
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
comprised in the same fashion as the
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
school board so it likewise gets seven
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
members five from the pre-existing
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
districts two at Large
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then we go and we put an eighth on
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
it so my question to the to the
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
education committee is why are we
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
designating one member of the school
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
board which is making its own
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
independent decisions and voting uh why
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
are we putting one of their members onto
 
04:19:26.109 --> 04:19:26.119 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee um taking the budget committee
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
out of having the same composition and
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
balance as the school
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
board and waiting it in that fashion
 
04:19:37.710 --> 04:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
illogical and I've watched it play out
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
in ways that I think are unfortunate so
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
in the tender
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
balance um of interests that I see in
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
Fall Mountain I suspect that uh this is
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
probably playing out weirdly and other
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
districts as well very simple
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bill School Board still designates
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
somebody School Board still has a rep
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
there's still communication and
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
understanding passing between the two
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
bodies but it's a non- voting
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
position so I got a question for you the
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
if you're on a local uh uh select
 
04:20:19.950 --> 04:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
board and the select board can appoint a
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
member from that board to the zoning
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
board who is a voting member why should
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
that not be able to occur then here in
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
this situation it's an interesting
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
distinction um the statutes on planning
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
boards describe six elected members
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the seventh member as statute
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
requires is an ex official voting member
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
from the select board so that's a
 
04:20:46.119 --> 04:20:47.309 align:start position:0%
from the select board so that's a
distinct

04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
distinct
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
statute sets up a distinct
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
scheme ends up with a odd
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
number and U it makes sense to me but uh
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
here where the statute says
 
04:21:02.830 --> 04:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
the The Cooperative School District
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
budget committee shall have the same
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
composition as the school boards we then
 
04:21:11.229 --> 04:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
end up knocking it off of
 
04:21:17.070 --> 04:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
committee oh represent B Bon thank you
 
04:21:21.109 --> 04:21:21.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
question U my question has to do with
 
04:21:24.990 --> 04:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that this is your
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular Cooperative district and you
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
thought that um other districts might
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
have the same sort of issue that you're
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
having I'm wondering if you could name
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
any of
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
those no I'm not here in a position to
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
speak about other
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
you further
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much wait
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
minute is there somebody at rson Hall do
 
04:21:53.229 --> 04:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
you have your hand
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
Christina

04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman lad hello again
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee baric Christina
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
from the school Wars Association we are
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill uh
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
1642 um I understand um the prime
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor's um concern with you end up
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
with an even number of of committees on
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
the uh on the on on the co-op budget
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee because you have an odd number
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
of school board members which is a
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that you have an
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
odd number rather than um making the
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
school board member and ex officio nonv
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
voting member of the committee um we
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
think that maybe an amendment to the um
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
preceding language on lines four and
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
five where it says the budget committee
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is current law the bucom shall have
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
the same number of members as the
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District plus the
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard member that makes an even
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
number change that language and just say
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
that the bucom shall have an even number
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
of of of members um plus the the the
 
04:23:04.269 --> 04:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
school board voting member would make an
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
odd number so we're not going to run
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
into a tie or whatnot I guess the other
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
issue that nsba would have is um um uh
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
you know if if the if the budget
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee if the budget committee is
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
that split and it's going to be a 44
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
Vote or a 55 Vote or whatever it is and
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
that tells me that one the School Board
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
needs to perhaps do a better job kind of
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
explaining its rationale for presenting
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
its budget to the school to the to the
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
budget committee but also the members of
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
that budget committee have to sort of
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
maybe work to reach some sort of
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
compromise on either what the bottom
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
line is or what specific you know
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are going to be made or
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
what line items are going to be adjusted
 
04:23:43.389 --> 04:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
within within that budget um you know we
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that taking way sort of the
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
voting voice of the of the school board
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
member on the Cooperative school
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
district is is the best way to address
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
some of the the challenges that that may
 
04:23:52.590 --> 04:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
have been raised in at least at least
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
one Cooperative School District so uh
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
for those reasons NH o nsba opposes the
 
04:23:59.309 --> 04:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill I'm happy to answer any
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions yes
 
04:24:01.560 --> 04:24:04.229 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions yes
represent

04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
leus I'm wondering what why you're
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
wanting to give a school board member
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
two voices two
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
votes um rather than one vote on the
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
school board and then the budget
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee has their votes and they're
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
separate it makes sense to have
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the have a member of the school board
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
there for asking questions and all of
 
04:24:34.349 --> 04:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff but
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
um why do you think they should have two
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
votes as opposed to the budget
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee their vote and it's sure thank
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
you for the question represent that's
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
certainly a fair question um I guess I
 
04:24:49.630 --> 04:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
would say while they're getting two
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
votes they're on two different just very
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
distinct public bodies the budget
 
04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee is a separate public body than
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
the school board is people can't serve
 
04:24:59.469 --> 04:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
on both per statute but people can
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly serve on more than one public
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
body plenty of people in this in this
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
building are on select board and and and
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
school boards and whatnot there are
 
04:25:10.590 --> 04:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
people that are both on a select board
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
um and and a school board um so I guess
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
that would be to one response I guess
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
the other response is um I don't know
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
when this language came into the statute
 
04:25:21.389 --> 04:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
but the last time the budget committee
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District statute was
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
revised was in
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
1996 you know if there's a challenge in
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
one in one Cooperative School District
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
then there may be a challenge in one
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
particular Cooperative School District
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
but moving in on 30 years this doesn't
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide I I all question no it was
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
actually more of a statement so I would
 
04:25:49.149 --> 04:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
pass are there any further question yes
 
04:25:49.159 --> 04:25:50.189 align:start position:0%
pass are there any further question yes
represent

04:25:50.189 --> 04:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
Tanner um would articles or uh questions
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
that are voted on in the budget
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee possibly be different than
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
what's voted at the whole school board
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
meeting could you could you repeat that
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
again I missed the first part of that
 
04:26:05.229 --> 04:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative would the would the
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
questions that that the budget committee
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
is voting on
 
04:26:13.389 --> 04:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
on my from my experience we have little
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
almost straw pole votes on different
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
things that are small parts of the
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
budget and then you have your final
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
budget overall vote right that's much
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
different or could be much different
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
than the school board what they're
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
actually voting on except for the final
 
04:26:32.429 --> 04:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
vote which is the school budget which is
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
should be like set a compromise between
 
04:26:36.030 --> 04:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
that budget yeah so thank you for the
 
04:26:38.590 --> 04:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
question representative I mean I I
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
suppose I suppose it could work that way
 
04:26:41.790 --> 04:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
and and and and if that's sort of been
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
the practice with your budget committee
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
and your community where you know the
 
04:26:46.950 --> 04:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
bucom is sort of voting on chunks if you
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
will or it will take the 1,000 line
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
items today we'll take the 2,000 line
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
items you know next week so on and so
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
forth um yeah that that that that that's
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
a reasonable Point as to why there may
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
be why the school board member um may
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a a separate vote as you're working
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
through the process through the budget
 
04:27:05.229 --> 04:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
committee the other thing too um and
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is sort of off topic not related to
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
your question but I a I apologize but it
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
thought about it earlier it just popped
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
in my head again um while we know that
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
the there are statutory requirements
 
04:27:17.950 --> 04:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
relative to budget committees under RSA
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
32 14 15 16 whatever they are um and
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
then they relate to RSA 195 Co 12a um I
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
can't think of the co-ops offand and we
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
know we've had a lot of discussion about
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
coopertive school districts in this room
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
the last seven or eight years um some
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement going back back to
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
like the' 60s have budget committees
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
within them um and and and through those
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement those budget
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
committees may have certain rights
 
04:27:48.670 --> 04:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
obligations responsibilities that may be
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more broad if you will or
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
different than what the statutory
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um necessarily allow for
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
what RSA 32 necessarily allows for so
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
you may have articles of agreement that
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
give that person voting rights so you're
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
going to have a conflict of laws in
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
there whether or not the voters to come
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
back and amend their articles of
 
04:28:10.349 --> 04:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
agreement that create their own internal
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
their own bucom um within their
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District that that
 
04:28:16.109 --> 04:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
may be in violation or or contrary to
 
04:28:19.710 --> 04:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
what a statutory language may may
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
include I thought I wasn't going to have
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
to pull all those articles of agreement
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
out of my file system well if if if and
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
if I could representative L just stand
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
we've got more bills would just take
 
04:28:31.109 --> 04:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
another minute I was going to think I
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
get I think we've got one more Co-op
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
Bill about the the voting mechanisms um
 
04:28:36.750 --> 04:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
some some of you are probably really
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
sick of me hearing this once again an
 
04:28:41.309 --> 04:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
hsba um will advocate for a 2-year long
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
study commission to look at RSA 195 in
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's totality chairman lad I know you
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
and I had had that conversation quite a
 
04:28:50.309 --> 04:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
bit over the over the last few years I
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
understand why that may not be an option
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
but just to get it on their record that
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
still is on hba's recommendation that we
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
do a S study Commission on RSA 195 and
 
04:28:57.920 --> 04:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
do a S study Commission on RSA 195 and
its

04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.080 --> 04:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
totality

04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
totality
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
yeah we've gone to the ringer on this
 
04:29:05.479 --> 04:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
yeah we've gone to the ringer on this
yeah

04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
Mr cordelli beside me myself it's been a
 
04:29:09.520 --> 04:29:10.510 align:start position:0%
Mr cordelli beside me myself it's been a
long

04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
trip it has um okay so is any more
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
questions for the New Hampshire school
 
04:29:16.439 --> 04:29:17.910 align:start position:0%
questions for the New Hampshire school
boards

04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
Association thank you very much thank
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair so on this
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill let's see it doesn't look like we
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
have any more cards on this bill this
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
642 here and we had that so with that
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the hearing and the
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
hearing is next one's up
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
at 1:45 so we have a 15minute break I
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
thought this was going to go longer
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:49.790 --> 04:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
controversial maybe we always ought to
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
hold these things in the afternoon when
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%

all these co-ops are
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%

here so representa spiber you're welcome
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.708 --> 04:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
Co-op thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
introduction I'd like to introduce hb1
 
04:46:02.670 --> 04:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
1481 relative to appointments to fill
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies to at Large large Cooperative
 
04:46:08.110 --> 04:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard seats so I bring you the
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
experiences of Fall Mountain and you
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
guys will uh subject it to your broad
 
04:46:14.000 --> 04:46:16.670 align:start position:0%
guys will uh subject it to your broad
experience

04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
balance in Schoolboard
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
composition varies from District to
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
district and it's usually something that
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
has a lot of history in the case of Fall
 
04:46:33.948 --> 04:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
Mountain where the Cooperative District
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
was created in
 
04:46:40.670 --> 04:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
1966 out of five prior districts each
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
representing one of the five constituent
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
towns we have a School Board of seven
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
five of the seats are assigned to uh the
 
04:46:49.798 --> 04:46:51.350 align:start position:0%
five of the seats are assigned to uh the
individual

04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
towns and two of them are at large how
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
those at large seats are held makes an
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
enormous difference in terms of the
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
decision making and the dynamic between
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
the towns Charles town has about 45% of
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:47:13.390 --> 04:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
Ada um Bears about 45% of the budget
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
although we have an
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily complicated I've been
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
told by state doe that we have the most
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
complicated uh allocation uh formulas
 
04:47:26.270 --> 04:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
there's something like seven or 10
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
different formulas within the
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
articles but generally speaking
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
Charlestown Bears 45% of the
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
cost and we have a very different
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
Dynamic and a very different profile in
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
our town than the other four towns it is
 
04:47:44.160 --> 04:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
our town than the other four towns it is
very

04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
typical that Charles toown will vote
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
something one way and the other four
 
04:47:52.590 --> 04:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
towns with their 55% will aggregate to
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelm Charlestown this is going to
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
come up in the next billal here as well
 
04:48:00.510 --> 04:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
bill is that specifically
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
midterm vacancy specifically an atlarge
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
seat it says when a vacancy occurs in
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
any Cooperative School Board seat that
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
is elected at large any successor
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
appointed to fill the vacancy shall be
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
domiciled in the same municipality as
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
the outgoing member was at the time of
 
04:48:21.160 --> 04:48:22.430 align:start position:0%
the outgoing member was at the time of
their

04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
elections I wouldn't be bringing you
 
04:48:26.990 --> 04:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
this bill unless I hadn't seen
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um how it plays out if it is
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
for Charlestown to hold one of the
 
04:48:37.760 --> 04:48:38.750 align:start position:0%
for Charlestown to hold one of the
atlarge

04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
atlarge
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
seats and for Walpole to hold another
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
wple is about 2third the size of
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
Charlestown the other three towns are
 
04:48:45.638 --> 04:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
Charlestown the other three towns are
considerably

04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
smaller so when a
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
Charlestown uh representative holds an
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
outlar seat and resigns midterm you
 
04:48:57.150 --> 04:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think it happens that often but
 
04:48:58.590 --> 04:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's happened several times in the last
 
04:48:58.600 --> 04:48:59.350 align:start position:0%
it's happened several times in the last
few

04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
few
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
years um what this bill would say is for
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
the balance of that term the appointment
 
04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
power of the remaining select board
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
members is restricted to choosing a
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
candidate from that Community to
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the balance that the voters
 
04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
established at the last election now of
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
course every uh several years when the
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
the term comes up it's back to the
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
voters to decide who's the best
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
candidate and where they're going to
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
come from but it's no accident in a
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
district like ARS that it is almost
 
04:49:40.510 --> 04:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
invariably two at llarge seats one held
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
by a Charlestown resident one held by a
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
Walpole resident and yet repeatedly when
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
a Charlestown resident has resigned
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
midterm the school board has moved to
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
seat somebody from another
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
town this is
 
04:49:59.230 --> 04:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
all decision Dynamics based on balance
 
04:49:59.240 --> 04:50:01.948 align:start position:0%
all decision Dynamics based on balance
of

04:50:01.948 --> 04:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
power thank you very much are there any
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative spillsbury
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Tanner thank you
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
04:50:12.990 --> 04:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh in your
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
scenario there's still a Charlestown
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative right because you're just
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
talking about at large seats in
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
Charlestown would if the Charlestown
 
04:50:25.548 --> 04:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
representative that's one of the
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
five bails out then they have they have
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
to do a Charlestown one so there'll
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
always be at least one Charlestown
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
person on that
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct there there would never
 
04:50:38.030 --> 04:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
be fewer than one Charlestown
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
representing charlestown's 45% interest
 
04:50:43.390 --> 04:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
you within your articles of agreement if
 
04:50:48.190 --> 04:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
you have them now some co-ops do not
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
have articles of
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
agreement so does it spell out how this
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
is to be done within your articles of
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
agreement it spells out that each prior
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
district will have one representative
 
04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that there will be two at large it
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
does not spell this out the replacement
 
04:51:08.430 --> 04:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
no it it has no language either
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
addressing or conflicting with this Bill
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
Christina thank you chairman lad members
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee um repres pres of
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and I thought about just
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
doing a point counter point um uh but I
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
I I joke I hope you take a little humor
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
in that uh we are opposed to the bill um
 
04:51:45.628 --> 04:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
primarily um the language that says um
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
it has to be from the same
 
04:51:48.750 --> 04:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities the outgoing member at
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
large is at large that's the that's the
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
Cooperative as a as a single entity
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a two Town Co-op
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
three Town Co-op Five Town Co-op at
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
large means at large the other aspect
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
too relative to this bill and I I I I I
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
get it I I know that you are
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
elected if you're in a co-op School
 
04:52:07.990 --> 04:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
Board member If You're Not Elected at
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
large you are representing to some
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
degree that particular community and
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
hsba goes through significant lengths
 
04:52:16.590 --> 04:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
when we're doing our trainings when
 
04:52:17.948 --> 04:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
we're talking to school board members
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
and well yes you have an obligation to
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
the voters in your town that elected you
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
your obligation is to the co-op as an
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
entity as the whole all the kids all the
 
04:52:29.708 --> 04:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
towns all the money it it it the the
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
sort of the the the the bifurcating by
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
that time in this town is is is not does
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
not always lead to the best educational
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
outcome so um again we're opposed to the
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
bill at large means at large it should
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
be within the provisions of either the
 
04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
the select board and the the the the the
 
04:52:48.030 --> 04:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
following paragraph or whether or not
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's a school board cooperate School
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
Board that's replacing the appointment
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
they should be able to choose from
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
whichever Community they choose that's
 
04:52:56.548 --> 04:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
what at large means um happy to answer
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
any questions are there any
 
04:53:00.990 --> 04:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:53:04.350 --> 04:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you chair um
 
04:53:06.590 --> 04:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
Mr uh I'm I'm kind of confused I'm I'm
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
only seeing that the change is and I may
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
being wrong Barrett the only change I'm
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
seeing is is the the uh bow on 15 and 16
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
and you talking about the L thank you
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
for the question represent if you look
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
at lines three through five that's new
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
language amend RSA 190 I'm on line two
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 1959a by inserting after so
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's the provision that nsba
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically objects to the the
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
provision with the Bold language um the
 
04:53:42.750 --> 04:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
follows line 7 through 18 or whatever we
 
04:53:45.548 --> 04:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
don't have a a specific issue with per
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
se um one point though that I will say
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
um be mindful so if you look at RSA I'm
 
04:53:53.470 --> 04:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
sorry if you look at line 16 where it
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
says um you know the requirements under
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 19519 a paragraph 8 VI I I I if you
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
look at the next bill we have coming up
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 13 83 um this removes one
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
of those paragraphs and would only get
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
down to um
 
04:54:11.200 --> 04:54:12.708 align:start position:0%
down to um
19519

04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
19519
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
A6 so both both these were to patch
 
04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have there's going to
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
be somebody in the clerk's office is
 
04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
going to have to figure out what the
 
04:54:21.070 --> 04:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
what they mean by rewriting one of the
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
statutes but um anyway um so I hope that
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
clarified representative Woodcock yeah
 
04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
so the best of your knowledge do when a
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
co-ops is the do they usually put app
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
point a person to fill out the rest of
 
04:54:41.280 --> 04:54:42.590 align:start position:0%
point a person to fill out the rest of
that

04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
year from a person that lives in that
 
04:54:47.548 --> 04:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
same district I I to be honest with your
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative I have no idea I mean I
 
04:54:50.670 --> 04:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
don't if somebody's appointed to a
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
school board I don't know how and why
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
and where I just they we get an email
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
that you know Rick lad is a new school
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
board member can you here's his email
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
address can you sign him up for for your
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
emails we don't ask how and why um you
 
04:55:04.990 --> 04:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
know I mean again how how depending on
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
however that that they have to be
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
appoint if there's a vacancy it has to
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
be appointed presumably within the
 
04:55:12.190 --> 04:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
context of what your articles of
 
04:55:13.628 --> 04:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
agreement say relative to your
 
04:55:15.070 --> 04:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
representation I believe the
 
04:55:16.548 --> 04:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
representative said that in Fall
 
04:55:19.390 --> 04:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
Mountain each of the five towns has one
 
04:55:22.548 --> 04:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
seat excuse me and then there are two at
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
large seats so if a person that was um
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
holding you know the aworth seat
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
resigned thenum that person has to be
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
from aworth the replacement does to to
 
04:55:35.548 --> 04:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
to to satisfy the conditions and terms
 
04:55:37.230 --> 04:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
of your articles of agreement but if
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's an at llarge seat that becomes
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
vacant that they're representing all
 
04:55:43.628 --> 04:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
five communities so why can't the person
 
04:55:45.788 --> 04:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
be selected from wherever they're
 
04:55:45.798 --> 04:55:47.070 align:start position:0%
be selected from wherever they're
selected

04:55:47.070 --> 04:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
selected
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
from or problem or why if the person
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's leaving was an elected
 
04:55:58.990 --> 04:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
member that to fill that year that that
 
04:56:02.110 --> 04:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
person's vacating wouldn't be taking the
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
position that that first elected member
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
had you know won and served as to
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
replace somebody from that same district
 
04:56:11.548 --> 04:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
right yeah I mean you know again it it
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
it it it's going to depend on what your
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement say if everybody
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
is elected at
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
large you know if your Co if your
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement say that all
 
04:56:21.390 --> 04:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
school board members are going to be
 
04:56:24.190 --> 04:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
elected at large it doesn't matter what
 
04:56:25.708 --> 04:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
town or Community you're you're
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
specifically from you know I mean I
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
don't think there are many district any
 
04:56:31.548 --> 04:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
many c-ops that do all at large I think
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
most of them are yours well yours may be
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit different though you're a
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
one toown Co-op
 
04:56:39.670 --> 04:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
so which is its own
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
animal all at large right so um anyway I
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that helps okay thank you any
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
04:56:48.480 --> 04:56:49.470 align:start position:0%

District 30 I appreciate your time today
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
here to present uh House Bill
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
1383 which uh is a bill to to um
 
05:17:17.948 --> 05:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully correct The Cooperative School
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
boards um the election process for uh
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
members who are at large members and who
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
are not at large
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
members uh
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
and putting together the bill
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
actually since getting the bill and and
 
05:17:36.548 --> 05:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
looking at it and talking with others
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards um I'm learning that there
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
may be some confusion on some of these
 
05:17:43.030 --> 05:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
lines so certainly open to some
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions as far as Corrections and I
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
think that there's already one amendment
 
05:17:51.548 --> 05:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
that um may be worth putting through but
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
um my my purpose for this bill is
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
um in regards to how the Cooperative
 
05:18:02.548 --> 05:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
articles of agreements have been drafted
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
or the bylaws have been drafted and how
 
05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're implemented uh if my number is
 
05:18:09.548 --> 05:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
correct we have 12 cooperatives in the
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
state cooperatives have a variety of
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
ways that they're going to build their
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
their uh Schoolboard composition as I
 
05:18:17.910 --> 05:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
heard there's one here that has all
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
members at large uh speaking from the
 
05:18:23.070 --> 05:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro deerings the district that I
 
05:18:26.190 --> 05:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
come from we have a five member School
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
Board One member is uh three members are
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
at large members and two members are not
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
the two that are not one is supposed to
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
be a Dearing resident the other one a
 
05:18:39.310 --> 05:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro resident the three at large
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
members um two of them are supposed to
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
be Hillsboro residents and one is
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a deing
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
resident the way that we've been voting
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
for as long as I could tell on the
 
05:18:52.430 --> 05:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
records is everybody's voted at large uh
 
05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
all positions are voted at large so um
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
deing has come forward with the fact
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they aren't being represented with
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
their person at the table that is a non-
 
05:19:05.310 --> 05:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
atlarge member and um and looking at
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
this and then looking at the other
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative contracts the AR articles of
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
agreement I've noticed that as we've
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
progressed in our years
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
um some of those articles of agreement
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
are very specific some of them are not
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro daring Cooperative started
 
05:19:22.480 --> 05:19:23.310 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro daring Cooperative started
in

05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
1957 and in 1957 when they started they
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
just listed these are this is the school
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
board makeup that we want they did not
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
actually spend specify that the at large
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
members are voted at large but the two
 
05:19:37.628 --> 05:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
others are not where Jeffrey ringe did
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
go as far as breaking out their school
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
board and saying X number are coming
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
from Jaffrey X number are coming from
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
ringe and only Jeffrey will vote on
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
jaffre's members and only ringe will
 
05:19:50.830 --> 05:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
vote on Ring's members and so
 
05:19:50.840 --> 05:19:52.350 align:start position:0%
vote on Ring's members and so
on

05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
so the the purpose of this bill is is to
 
05:19:58.590 --> 05:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
clean that up so that when there is an
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
article of agreement out there for our
 
05:20:02.548 --> 05:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
cooperatives and it doesn't specifically
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
specify the the piece on who's voting
 
05:20:07.510 --> 05:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
for it but it does does the breakout of
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
the composition of the school board my
 
05:20:12.750 --> 05:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
intention here is to clean that
 
05:20:15.788 --> 05:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
up with the with the wording here um
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
online item nine of my bill where we've
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
crossed out all members of The
 
05:20:21.548 --> 05:20:21.558 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board shall be
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
elected at large we crossed that out and
 
05:20:27.150 --> 05:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
um originally that was crossed out not
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to have any
 
05:20:30.510 --> 05:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
atlarge members that's not what my
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
intention is is here I I don't want to
 
05:20:34.910 --> 05:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
get rid of the atlarge
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
members what it is is that we don't want
 
05:20:41.070 --> 05:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
all members to be voted on an atla in an
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
election process at large so
 
05:20:47.948 --> 05:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
um what was happening with some of our
 
05:20:49.548 --> 05:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
school districts as they were coming to
 
05:20:51.070 --> 05:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
this line and they were stopping and
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
they were creating their ballots in each
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
of the towns so that all of their
 
05:20:56.830 --> 05:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members were being voted on
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
elected in an atlarge
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
position um so I think maybe that we can
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
leave this line but change the word
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
shall to maybe for those school
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
districts those School cooperatives
 
05:21:11.310 --> 05:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
rather that do have a 100% at large um
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
table further down on line um 26 of the
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh we had to make a correction RSA
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
669 is actually referring to a town
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
election where 671 is the school
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
district election so uh if if nothing
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
else that change should be corrected in
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
our in our
 
05:21:35.718 --> 05:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
our in our
statute

05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'll open this up for questions I
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
just I just want to recap so in case I
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear in this and I use Hillsboro
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
Dearing um as my example where we have a
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
a Hillsboro representative at the table
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
and a daring representative at the table
 
05:21:54.510 --> 05:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
that are not at large
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
members my intention is that Hillsboro
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
number is only voted on by the residents
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
of Hillsboro and that the daring
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
resident is only voted on by the
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
residents of Daring and that the three
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
at large seats are voted on by both
 
05:22:11.190 --> 05:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
towns and that that be consistent with
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
every other Cooperative that doesn't
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
actually have that spelled out so for
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
the cooperatives that are listing five
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
members seven members 12 members all as
 
05:22:23.548 --> 05:22:23.558 align:start position:0%
at large that doesn't change for the
 
05:22:25.470 --> 05:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative such as Jaffrey and ringe
 
05:22:27.190 --> 05:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
where they specifically spelled it out
 
05:22:29.070 --> 05:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
in their Artic articles of agreement
 
05:22:31.070 --> 05:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's a non-issue but there's other
 
05:22:32.430 --> 05:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
school districts out there that are
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
following suit with how things are being
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
done in Hillsboro Dearing that we want
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
to just clarify that for so that they're
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
getting the proper representation at the
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
table and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have for me thank
 
05:22:45.390 --> 05:22:45.400 align:start position:0%

official that is a recommendation that
 
05:23:00.430 --> 05:23:00.440 align:start position:0%

05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
both districts come to me to request
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
this change thank you thank you chair
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
represent Damon actually if I could
 
05:23:56.670 --> 05:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
expound a little bit further in fact
 
05:23:59.310 --> 05:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
that the last election cycle we had um
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
daring actually voted for or a school
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
board member so the residents of Daring
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
picked the person and then after
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro voted they picked somebody
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
different so daring came to me and said
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
here again is why we need to have this
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
fixed because we are not getting our
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
representation on at the table we're
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
getting Hillsboro's
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
representation yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
 
05:24:26.948 --> 05:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
Washington and Winslow Windsor
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
sorry uh only tuition to Hillsboro
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
during High School or are they part of
 
05:24:31.600 --> 05:24:33.310 align:start position:0%
during High School or are they part of
the

05:24:33.310 --> 05:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:35.788 --> 05:24:35.798 align:start position:0%
Cooperative they are tuition and they're
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of the SAU they're not part of the
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative follow up yes so what kind
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
of representation do they have on the
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative board if any they don't have
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
any representation on the Cooperative
 
05:24:49.470 --> 05:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
board they have their own school board
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
so they have their own town uh
 
05:24:53.230 --> 05:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
representation that they hold within
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
their town for their school board and
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
then they combine once the SAU so they
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
have individual Schoolboard
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
representation in their
 
05:25:01.520 --> 05:25:03.270 align:start position:0%
representation in their
Town

05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
Town
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair I need and
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here could you
 
05:25:09.788 --> 05:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said just a minute
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
ago about Dearing electing
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to the board and then they
 
05:25:18.750 --> 05:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
weren't were they not seated I mean I
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand what that what
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
you just said okay thanks for the
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
question and and I would be happy to
 
05:25:26.350 --> 05:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
clear that up daring has 1,200
 
05:25:29.230 --> 05:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
registered voters round numbers um in
 
05:25:31.868 --> 05:25:31.878 align:start position:0%
their town and Hillsboro has roughly
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
3,800 registered voters they had two
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
residents that were running for the
 
05:25:41.230 --> 05:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
resident seat the non-at llarge seat and
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
Darren chose the female who was running
 
05:25:47.230 --> 05:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
and she outnumbered the the gentleman
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
who was running in the incumbent he's
 
05:25:48.798 --> 05:25:49.750 align:start position:0%
who was running in the incumbent he's
the

05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:52.350 --> 05:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
incumbent when we counted in the votes
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro because they treated that
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
as an atlarge vote um the voters of
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro preferred that the gentleman
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
the incb
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
take the seat and did not vote in um
 
05:26:06.310 --> 05:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
favor of the female so therefore
 
05:26:08.110 --> 05:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro's voters were able to
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
outnumber the Dearing voters just by
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
population of
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
Voters and they selected the incumbent
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the Challenger correct and
 
05:26:20.590 --> 05:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
this language would change that correct
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you that is my intention thank you
 
05:26:26.110 --> 05:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli um thank you thank
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward this is
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
something that several of us have worked
 
05:26:30.320 --> 05:26:31.110 align:start position:0%
something that several of us have worked
on

05:26:31.110 --> 05:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
before um unsuccessfully I might add but
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
um we're hopeful um CU in our local
 
05:26:43.350 --> 05:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
school district um you have similar
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
situation in that uh for instance New
 
05:26:49.548 --> 05:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
Durham and Effingham representatives are
 
05:26:53.470 --> 05:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
elected by the entire quap District so
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the um residents of evingham are always
 
05:27:01.470 --> 05:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
well very often if not usually
 
05:27:04.430 --> 05:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
outnumbered in the election by the rest
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
of the co-op um District
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
voters um the um and and I think that
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
gets away with one man one vote uh
 
05:27:19.590 --> 05:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
concept that we were trying to correct
 
05:27:23.310 --> 05:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
um but I think one problem and maybe
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if you disagree
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
but in your Roman three is where you're
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
trying to correct
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.830 --> 05:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
correctly that's correct okay the um
 
05:27:44.840 --> 05:27:46.110 align:start position:0%
correctly that's correct okay the um
followup

05:27:46.110 --> 05:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes um the other thing that we um had
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in previous legislation that
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how you see being
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
handled in in your bill um but we said
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that as of such a a future date all
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
members had to be elected in accordance
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:28:11.390 --> 05:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
statute um whereever whereas you're just
 
05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
you just have an effective date of 60
 
05:28:17.470 --> 05:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
days and it um you know the law will
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
take effect but there won't be an
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
election you know until who knows when
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would be possible to
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
comply with the effective date without
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
setting a date by which the district or
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
the co-ops had to be in compliance with
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
this new statute um do you see any
 
05:28:41.548 --> 05:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
problems with the effective
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
date I viewed it a little differently
 
05:28:49.868 --> 05:28:49.878 align:start position:0%
um what my intention was here was to
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
not my intention is to follow the
 
05:28:53.910 --> 05:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement that are currently
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
in place and to not be not seek any
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
changes to what's already out there as
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
far as what's defined in the Articles of
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporation so um or articles of
 
05:29:06.190 --> 05:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
agreement I'm
 
05:29:09.150 --> 05:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
sorry so therefore it's to me I just
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
viewed it as an election process which
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
means that this wouldn't really require
 
05:29:16.350 --> 05:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
a long
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
um effective date process because if the
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement say that you're
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a five- member Board of
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
which each member is supposed to be from
 
05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
a specific town and not an at llarge
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
member then the correction is only those
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
towns are voting on them if your
 
05:29:38.910 --> 05:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement or your bylaws
 
05:29:41.110 --> 05:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
state that you're going to have 12
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
members at large there's nothing to
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
change all members stay at large the
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
voting stays the way that it has and in
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
the case where we have a mixture um such
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
as Hillsboro Dearing where we have two
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
members each representing a town and
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
three at large seats again there's
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
nothing to change the correction being
 
05:30:03.830 --> 05:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
that at the next election cycle which I
 
05:30:06.190 --> 05:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
would assume is going to be in 2024 I
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean 2025 rather the next election cycle
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro votes for the Hillsboro
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
resident daring votes for the daring
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
resident and the at llarge seats are
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
voted by both
 
05:30:18.510 --> 05:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
towns so there's no change yes one more
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
if I might so then your intent here
 
05:30:26.750 --> 05:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
would not change the situation in my
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
Co-op District where Effingham voters
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
would vote for the Effingham
 
05:30:35.190 --> 05:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative to the school board
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct if if your if your seats
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
are not listed as at large seats then
 
05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
only the residents of Effingham should
 
05:30:43.390 --> 05:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
be voting for that and no other Town
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
should be voting for that
 
05:30:47.310 --> 05:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative um ours is a little
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
situation is a little different they're
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
not listed as um at large seats
 
05:30:55.948 --> 05:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
Effingham seat is an Effingham seat it's
 
05:30:58.628 --> 05:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
not at large but the entire Co-op
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
District votes for the Effingham seat
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
not just Effingham
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
voters yeah say
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
that correct so that that falls under
 
05:31:12.510 --> 05:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one which online item nine
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
which it appears that your district is
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
voting all members to be at large me as
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
if they're at large members and that's
 
05:31:23.070 --> 05:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
where I don't think that should apply
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole point is that your
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
seats are not designated at large they
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
should not be voted on that way and in
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank you I think one of the
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
things just a comment here you know I'll
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
get you repr in Bon is that we need to
 
05:31:39.390 --> 05:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
look at all these agreements and there
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
are over 30 co-ops in the state and when
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
you look and there's some co-ops that
 
05:31:48.190 --> 05:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't have articles of
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
agreement and so there there's a lot to
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
this puzzle here representative Bon
 
05:31:55.190 --> 05:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and actually that was
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
part of my question is why couldn't this
 
05:31:59.230 --> 05:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
be solved through the articles of
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
agreement why does it have to be solved
 
05:32:00.760 --> 05:32:03.510 align:start position:0%
agreement why does it have to be solved
through

05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
legislation that's a loaded
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
question based upon how they vote and
 
05:32:11.430 --> 05:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the weights
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
within represent cordelli
 
05:32:17.948 --> 05:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
correct oh I I wasn't sure who she was
 
05:32:17.958 --> 05:32:21.548 align:start position:0%
correct oh I I wasn't sure who she was
asking

05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
Okay the reason that I believe this
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be handled here is because of
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one on line one where we
 
05:32:31.470 --> 05:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
have it written in the and defined in
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
the Articles of agreement the schools
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
the cooperatives are choosing to go with
 
05:32:38.390 --> 05:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
line one where it says all members of
 
05:32:40.628 --> 05:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative board shall be elected
 
05:32:42.430 --> 05:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
at large and I think that's what's
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
creating our problem so therefore I
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
corrected pron cascaden thanks would it
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
would it solve the problem if line one
 
05:32:55.470 --> 05:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
just read all members of The Cooperative
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
School Board shall be elected as defined
 
05:33:01.628 --> 05:33:01.638 align:start position:0%
in the warrants of article
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
because all the warrants of Articles
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
different articles of agreement I mean
 
05:33:07.840 --> 05:33:08.510 align:start position:0%
different articles of agreement I mean
I'm

05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:33:11.150 --> 05:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
not is that question to me or to your
 
05:33:13.750 --> 05:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
chair I'll ask you could it could it be
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
done that
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
simply not in my opinion and in my
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
opinion it's because in the case of
 
05:33:21.868 --> 05:33:21.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro deing when I looked at their
 
05:33:24.590 --> 05:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
contract their articles of agreement
 
05:33:26.708 --> 05:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
they did not although they specified two
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
seats were not at large and they
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
specified three were they did not
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
specify who is to be voting on that so
 
05:33:36.670 --> 05:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
the it directs to this law as far as how
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
it should be voted on and they're
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
choosing to follow line Roman numeral
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
one that says all members shall be
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
elected at large represent Cornell Thank
 
05:33:49.548 --> 05:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question um
 
05:33:51.750 --> 05:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
line nine Roman will run at the end of
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
it says or and every one of those says
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
as POS District as possible or most
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
nearly achieve or are they just ignoring
 
05:34:02.000 --> 05:34:03.310 align:start position:0%
nearly achieve or are they just ignoring
the

05:34:03.310 --> 05:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:06.430 --> 05:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
ores because it says all members of The
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board shall be
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
elected at large or the Cooperative
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
School District shall be divided into
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
or I can only speculate because I I'm
 
05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead and finish no I'm sorry I
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
can only speculate that they may be
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
ignoring it I don't really know for for
 
05:34:26.230 --> 05:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
absolute fact but there obviously is
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
confusion between several school
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
districts as representative Cordelia is
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
sharing a similar
 
05:34:35.548 --> 05:34:35.558 align:start position:0%
experience representative
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
Woodcock this is probably for you um the
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
would the article agreement if this
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
passed with the AR article agreement the
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
anyhow I'm not an attorney I know that
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
um but these articles of agreement go
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
way back into the 60s and even earlier
 
05:35:01.788 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
than that there are districts who have
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
changed what they're doing even though
 
05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
their artics agreement say something
 
05:35:08.910 --> 05:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
contrary I.E my district we had four for
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
one district and three for the other
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
District within the same town and for
 
05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
some reason we're all at large now and I
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
think it was the town District that had
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
three couldn't get anybody to run so it
 
05:35:24.948 --> 05:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
from may I ask a question on that do you
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
happen to know if anybody voted on that
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
change because I'm running into the same
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
situation and I can't find where the
 
05:35:36.270 --> 05:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
public body ever voted to change our
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
composition that occurred when there
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
were schools in both ends um we
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in one in
 
05:35:46.270 --> 05:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and we're a town about 5,000
 
05:35:48.868 --> 05:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
people and uh no I can't tell you how
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
anything functioned that I was chair of
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the select board chair of the fire
 
05:35:54.750 --> 05:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
district all that but I it goes back to
 
05:35:54.760 --> 05:35:55.470 align:start position:0%
district all that but I it goes back to
the

05:35:55.470 --> 05:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
days that the town was founded back in
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
the 1700s
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
and so it's just it's it's really
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand some of this and
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
we did take it and then you know how
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
people are how their towns are broken up
 
05:36:11.788 --> 05:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
based upon demographic based on property
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
valuation based upon some other kind of
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
denominator numerator you know it's it's
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
a it's a mess reveres
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
taking another question that's what you
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to would you consider it
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think that if we didn't
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
pass this bill or some similar version
 
05:36:32.638 --> 05:36:33.628 align:start position:0%
pass this bill or some similar version
of

05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:36:37.708 --> 05:36:37.718 align:start position:0%
it in districts where the municipalities
 
05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
are very different in population size
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
that the larger communities would always
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
representation I I would think that
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's a fair assumption to make which
 
05:36:53.230 --> 05:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
is I think the importance of having
 
05:36:55.470 --> 05:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement when you are
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
joining forces with a Cooperative school
 
05:37:00.270 --> 05:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
district oh
 
05:37:02.750 --> 05:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
didn't like what we doing so this would
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat address that that the folks
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
living in the smaller population
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
communities would be more assured yeah
 
05:37:13.868 --> 05:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
potentially more assured of
 
05:37:15.788 --> 05:37:15.798 align:start position:0%
representation if when they agreed to
 
05:37:17.470 --> 05:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
get into the Cooperative with another
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
District knowing full well that that
 
05:37:21.230 --> 05:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
District or that town or towns were
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
larger than them and they specified that
 
05:37:25.230 --> 05:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
they wanted to seat at the table and
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
that was agreed upon in the Articles of
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
agreement I believe that it is
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
reasonable for them to expect that they
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
have their choice and I think that they
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
deserve to have their choice at the T to
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
have their representation at the table
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
thank you if they agreed to at large
 
05:37:42.430 --> 05:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
members that was the risk that they
 
05:37:46.110 --> 05:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
took further questions represent Tanner
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't want us to lose um
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
the vision of the change on line
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
26 um from
 
05:37:56.830 --> 05:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan to official which then makes
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
it partisan seems like we've had a a lot
 
05:37:59.878 --> 05:38:00.788 align:start position:0%
it partisan seems like we've had a a lot
of

05:38:00.788 --> 05:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
um particularly during the mass no MK
 
05:38:06.670 --> 05:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
period a lot of contentious school board
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
meetings and school boards in general
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
have been having a difficult time I
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
think actually getting people to run and
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
really with the local elections like
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
select board County
 
05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it's it's basically a
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and it's on a nonpartisan
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
ballot do you see that this little
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
change is going to make a huge huge
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
concerned I will say that I'm in
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
agreement with you I personally am okay
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
with a nonpartisan and I do believe that
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
our local election should be nonpartisan
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
however the reality is they're not and
 
05:38:50.910 --> 05:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
we know that um so for that reason
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
because I was understanding the
 
05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
situation of it not being partisan I I
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
accommodated the requests from the sdga
 
05:39:01.150 --> 05:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
because I knew that they were pursuing
 
05:39:03.788 --> 05:39:03.798 align:start position:0%
the same thing so that we were
 
05:39:07.708 --> 05:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
consistent but I am certainly open to
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
changing that back because I do agree
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
they I I prefer them to remain
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan thank you further questions
 
05:39:17.628 --> 05:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Damon
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so on that same um one-word
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
change what is the definition of
 
05:39:22.920 --> 05:39:26.628 align:start position:0%
change what is the definition of
official

05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
ballot I don't I don't know what that
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
means you know to me an official ballots
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
an official ballot if the names are on
 
05:39:34.468 --> 05:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
there whether their party is or their
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
part is not so um that that can be
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
pretty broad right but I think the um
 
05:39:43.468 --> 05:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
expectation when you see official ballot
 
05:39:47.070 --> 05:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
is to see a side for Republicans a side
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
for Democrats and maybe a side for those
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
Independents and Libertarians
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
and so an official ballot is an official
 
05:39:56.990 --> 05:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
ballot whether the party is showing or
 
05:39:57.000 --> 05:39:57.868 align:start position:0%
ballot whether the party is showing or
not

05:39:57.868 --> 05:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
showing further question
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
representa Tanner I'm just wondering on
 
05:40:05.510 --> 05:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the official ballot whether um
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
independent libertarian green party you
 
05:40:10.830 --> 05:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
know on and on and on uh would actually
 
05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
be not you know be notified on an
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
official ballot um or whether they can
 
05:40:18.430 --> 05:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
run for those positions you know
 
05:40:22.670 --> 05:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't make the ballots so um yeah
 
05:40:24.468 --> 05:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't create the official
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
ballot the official ballot to me by my
 
05:40:28.468 --> 05:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
definition would be the ballot that is
 
05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
handed to me when I walk into the the
 
05:40:33.270 --> 05:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
voting booth me too thank you very much
 
05:40:35.548 --> 05:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions thank you very
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:38.958 --> 05:40:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
bill

05:40:40.590 --> 05:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you thank you all for your
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
time sharing your expertise on these
 
05:40:58.680 --> 05:41:00.670 align:start position:0%
time sharing your expertise on these
matters

05:41:00.670 --> 05:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
matters
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
I first heard about this bill a few days
 
05:41:05.548 --> 05:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
ago when I got a call from my school
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
moderator at in the Dairy Cooperative
 
05:41:10.990 --> 05:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
School District that's a school district
 
05:41:15.390 --> 05:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
all within Dair uh K through
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
8 and it's I guess it's that's what
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
makes it a little unusual and different
 
05:41:21.750 --> 05:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
than what you're all talking about my
 
05:41:23.548 --> 05:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
best guess is that there used to be
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
other towns a long time ago a very long
 
05:41:27.430 --> 05:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
time before my memory that there used to
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
be other towns and that's how it got the
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
term Cooperative School
 
05:41:35.788 --> 05:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
District uh my my school moderator
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
called and said that she likes this bill
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's Tina
 
05:41:42.430 --> 05:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
Guilford but she wanted a little bit
 
05:41:45.230 --> 05:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
more clarification about how it would be
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
implemented if so if it would be a
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
staggered implementation where say a
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
town has six districts would it be the
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
even numbered districts one year the odd
 
05:41:58.030 --> 05:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
numbered districts the next year or
 
05:42:01.788 --> 05:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
would it be every District all at
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
once it doesn't address it in this bill
 
05:42:05.708 --> 05:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
that I see so I think that's what it
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
would mean is all at once and she would
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
just like a little bit more
 
05:42:10.270 --> 05:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
clarification on that and I can answer
 
05:42:12.430 --> 05:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
some questions as best as I possibly can
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much okay uh are
 
05:42:16.510 --> 05:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
there any
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing but the the bill we
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
were dealing with that representative
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
cordellia we were putting in a
 
05:42:25.708 --> 05:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
transition process it's pretty hard to
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
say it's going to happen on day one it's
 
05:42:30.670 --> 05:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
all going to change um it's very
 
05:42:33.270 --> 05:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
difficult um seeing no other questions
 
05:42:47.468 --> 05:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman do I get a do you
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
program triple miles mostly I'm going to
 
05:42:58.350 --> 05:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
be an echo here I can be relatively
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
brief I put in an LSR to do essentially
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
the same thing and um representative
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
culen beat me to the punch so I became
 
05:43:09.070 --> 05:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
her first
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor my concern is the primary one
 
05:43:14.468 --> 05:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
that she
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
expressed and that is where articles of
 
05:43:21.310 --> 05:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
agreement designate a seat specifically
 
05:43:25.230 --> 05:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
to represent a town or a prior District
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
only the members the voters of that
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
Community should elect their own
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative and I can tell you that
 
05:43:34.830 --> 05:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
in Fall Mountain
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
um there are five towns and there are
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
five individual seats assigned one each
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and two at large as I described before
 
05:43:49.390 --> 05:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
but all seven are voted across the board
 
05:43:53.390 --> 05:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
at large by all of the um voters in the
 
05:43:56.990 --> 05:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
district so where you have an atlarge
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
seat representing the district it makes
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
sense that all the voters of the
 
05:44:04.030 --> 05:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
district should vote at large we're
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
using the term at large in two different
 
05:44:05.760 --> 05:44:07.070 align:start position:0%
using the term at large in two different
ways

05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
ways
 
05:44:10.270 --> 05:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
representation versus who gets the
 
05:44:14.190 --> 05:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
vote those have to be separated when it
 
05:44:15.990 --> 05:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
comes to the seats that represent the
 
05:44:16.000 --> 05:44:17.150 align:start position:0%
comes to the seats that represent the
individual

05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:44:19.628 --> 05:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
towns so I have
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
seen repeatedly the dynamic where a
 
05:44:26.788 --> 05:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
candidate in a contested election for
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
the charl town seat prevent prevails in
 
05:44:32.468 --> 05:44:32.478 align:start position:0%
Charlestown with a majority
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
vote and the
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
runnerup uh then prevails in the
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
election because the voters from the
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
other four towns choose a different
 
05:44:45.510 --> 05:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
person I have seen that happen several
 
05:44:48.430 --> 05:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
times I've also seen it happen where the
 
05:44:50.430 --> 05:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
voters of
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
Charlestown have as uh representative
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
Miler was getting that
 
05:45:00.390 --> 05:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
before selected a CH allenger to an
 
05:45:03.468 --> 05:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
incumbent but the other four towns have
 
05:45:05.788 --> 05:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
voted for the incumbent so where
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
Charlestown was trying to displace
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
somebody to put in in effect a
 
05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
substitute they were
 
05:45:17.948 --> 05:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
prevented I would also say in in our
 
05:45:21.548 --> 05:45:21.558 align:start position:0%
district um to representative Damon's
 
05:45:25.230 --> 05:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
question of a of Representative
 
05:45:30.670 --> 05:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
culcom the fact that Charlestown has 45%
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
does not allow Charlestown to presume it
 
05:45:36.510 --> 05:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
will its view will prevail because in
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
fact the
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
55% taking the other four towns together
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
majority but further uh comment because
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want this to sound like it's
 
05:45:50.110 --> 05:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
exclusively from a Charlestown Centric
 
05:45:51.468 --> 05:45:51.478 align:start position:0%
point of
 
05:45:54.670 --> 05:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
view we have 45% of the
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
voters Walpole has about
 
05:46:03.548 --> 05:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
30 st's a little less than um 20 and
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
langon and and aworth are in the single
 
05:46:10.990 --> 05:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
digits why should the 45% of the
 
05:46:12.910 --> 05:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
electorate from Charlestown be able to
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
tell Lil aworth who their representative
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
is or langon so in the same way I want
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
the voters of Charlestown to designate
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
their representative I don't want the
 
05:46:26.670 --> 05:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
voters of Charlestown to tell langner
 
05:46:28.910 --> 05:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
aworth who they should have we're
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
talking about dramatic disparities there
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
are just under 5,000 um residents I
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
don't know the the um uh the voter count
 
05:46:39.468 --> 05:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
in Charlestown and there are 800 in
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
aworth so if they're intended to
 
05:46:44.430 --> 05:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
represent the individual town or prior
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
District then we need to elect them in
 
05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
that way that's the proposition of the
 
05:46:51.390 --> 05:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill I would I would just say as a
 
05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
couple of technical points if you look
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
at the caption uh with the analysis
 
05:46:57.390 --> 05:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
rather on the first page the bill
 
05:46:59.070 --> 05:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
requires Cooperative School Board to
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
elect representatives from pre-existing
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
districts only from voters within the
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
district stop there that's clear that's
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
endorsing and prohibits the atlarge
 
05:47:12.190 --> 05:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
election of all members that's
 
05:47:15.948 --> 05:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
problematic um and I think that there
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
will probably this bill should be passed
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
but it should be cleaned up and you will
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably need an amendment to address
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
striking out of uh line
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
nine there are districts that have all
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
at large members I'm a little bit
 
05:47:35.070 --> 05:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
confused I think it may have been
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden or Bon who
 
05:47:38.548 --> 05:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
raised the question about the
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
ores if you look at the language in the
 
05:47:44.750 --> 05:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
statute before the Amendments shall be
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
limited this is in lines five and six
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
shall be limited to the Alternatives
 
05:47:48.600 --> 05:47:49.670 align:start position:0%
shall be limited to the Alternatives
contained

05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
contained
 
05:47:53.230 --> 05:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
herein and that means each of the of
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
these uh listed paragraphs is an
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
independent alternative I haven't
 
05:48:00.030 --> 05:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
thought through how those really
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
interact but I think just striking one
 
05:48:05.310 --> 05:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
is problematic I also think that the
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
question of nonpartisan versus official
 
05:48:09.270 --> 05:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
is extraneous to the key point of the
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill I would urge you to stay focused on
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
the key point of the bill if I can do
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
anything to help any member of this
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee redraft I'm available um but
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh please take a strong enough interest
 
05:48:23.310 --> 05:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
in it to clean it up and pass
 
05:48:25.468 --> 05:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much are there any
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tanner thank
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
05:48:32.910 --> 05:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
does on in Fall Mountain does aworth
 
05:48:34.350 --> 05:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
have a representative on the school
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
board and Langdon have a separate
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative on the Schoolboard each
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
town has their own so yes to aworth yes
 
05:48:44.030 --> 05:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
to langon and allstead Walpole and
 
05:48:46.590 --> 05:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
Charlestown okay and so Char Charlestown
 
05:48:50.590 --> 05:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
with its 4,800 voters has a seat the
 
05:48:53.310 --> 05:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
same as aworth does with 800 voters I
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
believe acworth's total student count
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
currently is about 24 that's true so
 
05:49:01.070 --> 05:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of influence on the
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
school board with one out of seven seats
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed thank you further
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much it's
 
05:49:12.750 --> 05:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
important to note that there are some
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
co-ops like the one the town of Carol is
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
in which Carol's very small but Carol's
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
being asked to pay 40 Grand per pupil to
 
05:49:24.910 --> 05:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
carry the burden for the co-op and and
 
05:49:29.830 --> 05:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
then vice versa we had um a town which
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
the previous chair of ways and means
 
05:49:34.830 --> 05:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
didn't want anything changed but this
 
05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
town had the highest property values and
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
all and and and paying the tab and they
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to control that so there there's
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of angles which we're going to
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to consider on this uh uh
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
representative Barrett Christina Barrett
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.440 --> 05:50:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
today

05:50:02.670 --> 05:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.708 --> 05:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you again chairman lad
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um we're
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill but I do want to
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank the prime sponsor for coming in
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
and giving a a good explanation of sort
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasoning and rationale within
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
her within her District that helped me
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
sort of clarify um at least have a
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
better understanding as as to where the
 
05:50:22.110 --> 05:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
the bill was coming from and sort of the
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
purpose and and behind that um as always
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
so uh when we have the bills relative to
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
the election of Cooperative School Board
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
um members um my first question is
 
05:50:34.510 --> 05:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
always have the voters considered any of
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
the other options that are available to
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
them under the existing statute I
 
05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
believe there are four or five Options
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
under current law on how Cooperative
 
05:50:43.708 --> 05:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
school board members can be elected at
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
large a district um You Know A District
 
05:50:50.110 --> 05:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh proportional
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
representation um the current provision
 
05:50:55.350 --> 05:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is current uh uh paragraph four
 
05:50:58.510 --> 05:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
which is looking to be amended you know
 
05:51:00.150 --> 05:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
have have have the voters had an
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to wait on amending the
 
05:51:03.990 --> 05:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement to change to
 
05:51:05.708 --> 05:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
change the how they're going to be
 
05:51:07.708 --> 05:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
elected locally that's always the first
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
aspect um we would certainly object to
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
the elimination of of of um the atlarge
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
provision in in in paragraph one I'm
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
sorry in uh line nine um which is
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
current law paragraph one um and we
 
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
object to the the change um at the end
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
of from the nonpartisan ballot system to
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
the official uh ballot system I'm aware
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
of that bill I I forget the bill number
 
05:51:32.830 --> 05:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
but it's basically a local option where
 
05:51:35.310 --> 05:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
the voters could um determine whether or
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
not they wanted their Local School Board
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
elections um to be partisan where I
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
presume that means you'd have to file
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
with a with a political party um you
 
05:51:45.708 --> 05:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
know I would say that we have um too
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
much politics in in in public education
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
respectfully to all of you but you know
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
my members live it every day we don't
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
need to exacerbate that by any means um
 
05:51:58.990 --> 05:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
but again um you know I it
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
nhba were opposed to the bill the idea
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
of of having you know the the voters in
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro vote for the Hillsboro rep and
 
05:52:07.948 --> 05:52:07.958 align:start position:0%
the voters for having endearing voting
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
for The Dearing rep I think there's
 
05:52:11.590 --> 05:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
certainly some Merit to that um we would
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
have to be mindful of the other sort of
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
impact though that it may have on
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement I mean I I I I
 
05:52:20.910 --> 05:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
need to go back and research sort of the
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
one man one vote principle and and some
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
of the case law that's come out from
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
this but if we have a a a town that has
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
4,000 th000 people in a town that has
 
05:52:32.110 --> 05:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
2,000 people and we're looking for prop
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
proportional representation do we have
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
to change the articles of agreement so
 
05:52:37.948 --> 05:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
that town with 4,000 people has two reps
 
05:52:40.150 --> 05:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
then and the town with 2,000 people only
 
05:52:42.468 --> 05:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
has has has one rep then I'd have to do
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
some more research on that but that
 
05:52:45.310 --> 05:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
would be a concern that that I would
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
have as well too um and then last it's
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
already been talked about sort of the
 
05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
Staggering in of of of how this would
 
05:52:54.030 --> 05:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
how this would would would take effect
 
05:52:55.750 --> 05:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
because we know March elections are in
 
05:52:57.070 --> 05:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
March that person's elected to a
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
three-year seat but then if the Law
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
changes we need to figure out some
 
05:53:02.430 --> 05:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
whether staggering or whatever it might
 
05:53:04.110 --> 05:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
be you'd have to you'd have to build in
 
05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
some lead time probably probably over
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
the course of about three or four years
 
05:53:10.750 --> 05:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
I would say um in order for that to to
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
sort of um be actualized so um those are
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
those are NH hba's comments let's let's
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
always try fixing it locally first I
 
05:53:21.230 --> 05:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
local Solutions in my opinion have or
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
local problems have local Solutions most
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the time um I understand that there's
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
more than one Co-op that may be impacted
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
by this but um you know I would
 
05:53:30.990 --> 05:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
encourage the school boards um to maybe
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
look at what other options are available
 
05:53:35.230 --> 05:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
to them before we we move forward with
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
with changing legislation with that I'm
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
Happ to answer any questions Miler thank
 
05:53:42.190 --> 05:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
here I need
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
clarification the role of the Articles
 
05:53:52.628 --> 05:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
of of agreement Visa State
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
Statute wouldn't it it seems to me that
 
05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
if there's a
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the article of agreement
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
locally that those ought to be amended
 
05:54:03.270 --> 05:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
first because they're particularly
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
targeted at a particular problem within
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
that Co-op rather than coming here and
 
05:54:13.628 --> 05:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
trying to have a statute so that's my
 
05:54:16.110 --> 05:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
confusion on why aren't we addressing
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
these at the local level first before
 
05:54:21.030 --> 05:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
trying to address something that from a
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
statute standpoint clarify that thank
 
05:54:25.948 --> 05:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent of nhba
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
would agree with those sentiments if the
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
if if the voters in a co-op have
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
concerns over you know the funding
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism proportionality property taxes
 
05:54:38.110 --> 05:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
student enrollment you can amend the you
 
05:54:39.868 --> 05:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
can amend the the the articles of
 
05:54:42.910 --> 05:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
agreement to fix that um you know same
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
thing with the elections if if if the
 
05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
voters in that Co-op are not crazy with
 
05:54:49.230 --> 05:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
the way that the election methods are
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
occurring based on their current
 
05:54:52.670 --> 05:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement amend the articles
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
of agreement or have a study commission
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
locally not through this body but have a
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
local study committee to examine what
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
options are available to us let's bring
 
05:55:03.030 --> 05:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the attorneys to talk about the one
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
man one vote get a legal opinion about
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
how the representation may work out um
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know and and there's another thing
 
05:55:14.030 --> 05:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
aspect to this too and um you know I'm
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
not naive enough to to ignore sort of
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
this town and this town and who's paying
 
05:55:22.390 --> 05:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
more in taxes and they've got more kids
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
but our per pupil is higher I I
 
05:55:26.910 --> 05:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
understand that from a local taxpayer
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
property owner samp point I understand
 
05:55:31.390 --> 05:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
that um but sort of as I mentioned I
 
05:55:33.868 --> 05:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
think it was on on on on the first Bill
 
05:55:36.270 --> 05:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
about the co-op as a single entity
 
05:55:38.430 --> 05:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
serving all the kids together within
 
05:55:40.390 --> 05:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
that school district and I I don't need
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
to I I won't waste anybody's time we
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
talked about this a couple years ago and
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
some members were on the committee some
 
05:55:47.230 --> 05:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
members were not about sort of the long
 
05:55:49.030 --> 05:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
history of co-ops and why were why they
 
05:55:51.468 --> 05:55:51.478 align:start position:0%
were started to begin with um and the
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
regionalization you know to save
 
05:55:56.030 --> 05:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
administrative cost um to save building
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
cost so on and so forth um so let's not
 
05:56:01.868 --> 05:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
let's not necessarily presume that um
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
you know just because this town has the
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
most more voters than this town that
 
05:56:08.350 --> 05:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
they're trying to you know stick it to
 
05:56:09.990 --> 05:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
the little guy or stick it to the small
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
town I don't think that's anybody's
 
05:56:13.270 --> 05:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
intent I me I understand that you know
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to look at your property
 
05:56:16.830 --> 05:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
taxes first I I totally get that but in
 
05:56:19.030 --> 05:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
the context of a of a Cooperative School
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
District where we're trying to educate
 
05:56:23.310 --> 05:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
all the kids and all these communities
 
05:56:24.868 --> 05:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's a general sentiment
 
05:56:26.468 --> 05:56:26.478 align:start position:0%
that you know what's good for one is
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
good for all and what's good for all is
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
good for the rest of
 
05:56:32.910 --> 05:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
us thank you very much is it not true
 
05:56:34.590 --> 05:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
that when these articles of agreement
 
05:56:38.390 --> 05:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
were written years ago that now the
 
05:56:40.350 --> 05:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
dynamic in those communities has
 
05:56:43.868 --> 05:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
significantly changed Y and
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
so we did we not try to change and put
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
into the statute that we've been talking
 
05:56:53.948 --> 05:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
about here several years back yeah an
 
05:56:55.788 --> 05:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that the articles of
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
agreement had to be updated in a certain
 
05:57:01.390 --> 05:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
period a time period five years 10 years
 
05:57:03.150 --> 05:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
every 10 years or so thank you for the
 
05:57:04.670 --> 05:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
question representative we certainly had
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
that discussion that did not make it in
 
05:57:09.150 --> 05:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
into law though um I think we there were
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
some conversation about reviewing it
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
every 10 years in accordance with um
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
that latest decade census um to you know
 
05:57:18.190 --> 05:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
if you have to reapportion the number of
 
05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
seats um that's my recollection I mean I
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
know it's not in law but we had that
 
05:57:22.558 --> 05:57:26.788 align:start position:0%
know it's not in law but we had that
conversation

05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:31.150 --> 05:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
yeah question yeses
 
05:57:34.430 --> 05:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
Woodcock once again thank you for coming
 
05:57:36.868 --> 05:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
um go follow and representative Milo
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
this question was someone I asked before
 
05:57:41.830 --> 05:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
G asked before which FES precedent there
 
05:57:44.788 --> 05:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
the the article agreement or the RSA
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much I mean the
 
05:57:47.150 --> 05:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement have to be in
 
05:57:50.590 --> 05:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
accordance with the statute you know um
 
05:57:52.430 --> 05:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know my understanding is that the
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
most most of the times that this that
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement have been
 
05:57:58.230 --> 05:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
amended it's usually
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
your your your your cost you know what
 
05:58:02.468 --> 05:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
district is paying what and based on
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
what formula um you know I haven't done
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
a review of all 32 articles of agreement
 
05:58:10.788 --> 05:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
but the fact that some of these articles
 
05:58:13.468 --> 05:58:13.478 align:start position:0%
of agreement predate the current
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
statutes they probably some areas and
 
05:58:18.510 --> 05:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
some of them where where the articles of
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
agreement are not in full compliance
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
with with the current with the current
 
05:58:24.270 --> 05:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
statute but I also again without having
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed RSA 195 and its entirety
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
probably since last year when we had a
 
05:58:33.070 --> 05:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
co-op bill you know the that statute is
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
is not gives a lot of flexibility to the
 
05:58:36.990 --> 05:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
locals to craft their own their own
 
05:58:38.788 --> 05:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
articles their own contract essentially
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
but I mean the state law would always
 
05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
take would always take precedent and the
 
05:58:43.948 --> 05:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement have to fit within
 
05:58:46.468 --> 05:58:46.478 align:start position:0%
that but without again without having
 
05:58:48.468 --> 05:58:48.478 align:start position:0%
looked at the what the articles of
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
agreement have to specifically contain
 
05:58:51.990 --> 05:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
it may list you know has to contain
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
these 10 things but how that's done is
 
05:58:56.830 --> 05:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
is is a local is a local determination
 
05:58:58.990 --> 05:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank thank you R luus you had
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
up yeah talking about the effective date
 
05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is talking
 
05:59:07.878 --> 05:59:09.548 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is talking
about

05:59:09.548 --> 05:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
elections and that therefore it could go
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
into effect right away because it
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any effect until the next
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
election and so each election so it
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
seems like it would naturally phase in
 
05:59:28.750 --> 05:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
just because
 
05:59:30.628 --> 05:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
you know at each election because of the
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
election cycle yeah yeah I mean that
 
05:59:36.110 --> 05:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's I suppose that's possible
 
05:59:39.628 --> 05:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me um yeah I I
 
05:59:42.750 --> 05:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
suppose that's possible but I I think
 
05:59:44.468 --> 05:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a consideration now we'd
 
05:59:46.350 --> 05:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
have to find out the mechanics of of how
 
05:59:49.190 --> 05:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
it worked you know so if it says if we
 
05:59:53.548 --> 05:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
eliminate you know if we well we'd have
 
05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
to we'd have to give it some thought as
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
to as to how to implement that thank you
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
further questions thank I I'll just ask
 
06:00:05.910 --> 06:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
him out thank you very much thank you no
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
further question thank you very much
 
06:00:10.230 --> 06:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
close this hearing and go into the next
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%

staff for all five five two positions
 
06:04:32.350 --> 06:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
per superintendent and business manager
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
or finance manager which is another one

calls it of those five totals
 
06:04:37.478 --> 06:04:39.910 align:start position:0%
calls it of those five totals
$983,000

06:04:39.910 --> 06:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
$983,000
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
but that's only for 10 positions there
 
06:04:46.868 --> 06:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
are still 36.3 positions plus rent
 
06:04:50.670 --> 06:04:50.680 align:start position:0%

06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
number if we went down to one SAU up
 
06:04:56.080 --> 06:04:58.350 align:start position:0%
number if we went down to one SAU up
north

06:04:58.350 --> 06:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
north
 
06:05:00.910 --> 06:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
there is currently that all of you have
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
I believe it's been passed out uh an
 
06:05:06.190 --> 06:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to this this amendment came
 
06:05:09.548 --> 06:05:09.558 align:start position:0%
about after discussions with uh a
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the Department of
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
Education and uh this is simply four
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill uh where uh uh
 
06:05:23.990 --> 06:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
numeral two says new paragraph school
 
06:05:25.788 --> 06:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
administrative units that's where the
 
06:05:28.510 --> 06:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
amendment begins and it goes through to
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
just before number three which says
 
06:05:35.190 --> 06:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
effective date these were items uh that
 
06:05:39.510 --> 06:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
were uh let's say uh not typos but just
 
06:05:42.190 --> 06:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh lack of communication where we used
 
06:05:46.590 --> 06:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
to say school districts on in the uh
 
06:05:50.510 --> 06:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
Bill uh line nine and uh was pointed out
 
06:05:52.590 --> 06:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
to us that should say sa and that's one
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the things the amendment changed and
 
06:05:58.990 --> 06:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
then they added two extra sections uh d
 
06:06:02.830 --> 06:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
and e uh after item C which used to be
 
06:06:02.840 --> 06:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
and e uh after item C which used to be
line

06:06:03.910 --> 06:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
06:06:07.310 --> 06:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
16 uh and that has to do when the number
 
06:06:11.430 --> 06:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
of students for the SAU the merged SAU
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
counted uh and on recommendation from
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from uh doe we picked uh
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
October first and apparently there's
 
06:06:25.110 --> 06:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
another count they do at that time I do
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
not remember what he told me uh and then
 
06:06:33.110 --> 06:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh they wanted uh item e also added
 
06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
into it
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so that everybody gets the uh
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
$200 and that was another question what
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
if uh conquered were to merge with a
 
06:06:49.948 --> 06:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
smaller um SAU next to it would the new
 
06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
merged unit would let's say all
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
13,000 or thereabouts students get the
 
06:06:58.590 --> 06:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
$200 yes they would because they're a
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
merged unit it's going to be $200 for
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
the merged unit per pupil they get that
 
06:07:06.190 --> 06:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
for two
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
years uh Plus at the same time they're
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
saving one or more SAU administrative
 
06:07:15.628 --> 06:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
costs that would go away they would keep
 
06:07:18.468 --> 06:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
that permanently for years 3 four five
 
06:07:18.478 --> 06:07:19.350 align:start position:0%
that permanently for years 3 four five
and

06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
on this bill is offering an in uh
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
incentive to any saus that wish to merge
 
06:07:28.390 --> 06:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
with another in order to in order to
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
lessen their expenses and get an extra
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
Grant of $200 per student in the merged
 
06:07:37.868 --> 06:07:37.878 align:start position:0%

06:07:58.510 --> 06:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
you this has been an issue that's been
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussed time times before according
 
06:08:05.830 --> 06:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
speak um and it makes a lot of sense I
 
06:08:07.310 --> 06:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
mean I know when I was assistant
 
06:08:10.350 --> 06:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent I did a study and we came
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
out um saving at least $100,000 and that
 
06:08:18.350 --> 06:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
was a lot of years ago um but people
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
want to have their own district and it
 
06:08:23.390 --> 06:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
just never seems to happen in the North
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
Country it makes absolute sense that
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
they'd have one super superintendent to
 
06:08:31.390 --> 06:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
carry out those duties so how are you
 
06:08:33.750 --> 06:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
what have you done to build the
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
awareness of the communities around this
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
in your North in your North
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
Country before I answer that part one of
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
the things the speaker told me when at
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
lunch uh in the four or five previous
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
times it was not optional for the saus
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
to merge those bills that came before is
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
you will that's apparently why they
 
06:09:00.548 --> 06:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
failed this one says if you want to you
 
06:09:03.708 --> 06:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
can and if you do here's an incentive if
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
you get above 1500
 
06:09:08.310 --> 06:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
students uh now as far as the North
 
06:09:12.350 --> 06:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
Country goes uh I would say now for the
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
last two or three
 
06:09:19.230 --> 06:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
years uh sau7 in colbrook has been
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
attempting to
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
merge uh they've been attempting to
 
06:09:28.110 --> 06:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
merge even across state lines uh and go
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
that way um but they know they've got to
 
06:09:36.468 --> 06:09:36.478 align:start position:0%
cut down on uh their uh amounts uh if
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
all the saus in the North Country if I
 
06:09:44.350 --> 06:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
remember correctly SAU uh seven has the
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
largest staff I believe they've got 10
 
06:09:49.390 --> 06:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
there are two that have
 
06:09:53.150 --> 06:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
eight uh the one I'm in 58 has
 
06:09:53.160 --> 06:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
eight uh the one I'm in 58 has
six

06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
six
 
06:09:57.468 --> 06:09:57.478 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:09:59.788 --> 06:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
can't remember what the other one had oh
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
14.3 that's where the 0.13 comes in uh I
 
06:10:06.750 --> 06:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
don't know who that person is but uh
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
they are working on
 
06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
it yes um the idea that we want local
 
06:10:17.070 --> 06:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
control well it's two towns away maybe
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
three towns away it's still local we've
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
got fewer people in Coos County than
 
06:10:23.638 --> 06:10:25.270 align:start position:0%
got fewer people in Coos County than
portsmouth's

06:10:25.270 --> 06:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's
 
06:10:30.750 --> 06:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:34.390 --> 06:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
one so people think about it it's just
 
06:10:36.628 --> 06:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
we believe the incentive might be a
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
slight nudge to get them to hey maybe
 
06:10:41.150 --> 06:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
we'll do
 
06:10:44.830 --> 06:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
it I hope so Doo thank you very much are
 
06:10:46.070 --> 06:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
there further questions representa
 
06:10:48.910 --> 06:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I'm just interested
 
06:10:51.350 --> 06:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
in in who you're counting as staff is it
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
like the transportation director is that
 
06:10:57.390 --> 06:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
part of the SAU staff is the uh special
 
06:11:00.350 --> 06:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
ed director part of the SAU
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
staff hold on a minute ma'am and I can
 
06:11:05.310 --> 06:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
tell you this came from the Department
 
06:11:07.548 --> 06:11:07.558 align:start position:0%

they've got clerical other support and
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
they came up with the totals for the
 
06:11:28.628 --> 06:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
saus uh which uh uh for example the
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
conquered SAU office has
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%

half other support for the 52.7 and this
 
06:11:58.590 --> 06:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
comes from the Department of Ed for
 
06:12:03.468 --> 06:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
every single uh SAU just yes um from my
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
experience the like the transportation
 
06:12:10.548 --> 06:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
was a really big SIU uh staff um or at
 
06:12:13.868 --> 06:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
least it was housed there also the
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
grounds and maintenance uh were all con
 
06:12:20.110 --> 06:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
you know centered into those things and
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
when I look at at at um the North
 
06:12:26.788 --> 06:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
Country I mean Transportation must be I
 
06:12:28.150 --> 06:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
know for our school because it was a
 
06:12:30.468 --> 06:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Transportation was like huge
 
06:12:33.788 --> 06:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
because it we had such a wide area so
 
06:12:36.468 --> 06:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
the amount of mileage seems to be you
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
know a really big thing for those
 
06:12:42.590 --> 06:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
districts I can say for the uh my SAU
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
06:12:49.230 --> 06:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
58 um I've been up there for coming up
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
on 22 years and as far as I know they
 
06:12:57.548 --> 06:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
have never had a transport
 
06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
individual in the SAU office either the
 
06:13:06.070 --> 06:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh SAU superintendent handled it or uh
 
06:13:08.590 --> 06:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
the business manager handled it on as
 
06:13:11.548 --> 06:13:11.558 align:start position:0%
part of their duties but there was no uh
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation director or anything like
 
06:13:19.390 --> 06:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
that further questions yes represent
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thanks for taking my
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering what the basis of
 
06:13:29.670 --> 06:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
the 15 00 student minimum for a merged
 
06:13:32.190 --> 06:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
district is I just added up the student
 
06:13:34.390 --> 06:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
population of the three
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
towns that some folks in my area might
 
06:13:40.190 --> 06:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
think should go back to being one school
 
06:13:42.430 --> 06:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
district they're three saus now there
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
used to be five towns in that SAU it
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't add up to 1,200 never mind 1500
 
06:13:50.030 --> 06:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
but it would be a cost savings it would
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
be a cost savings and thank you for your
 
06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
question right now there
 
06:13:58.750 --> 06:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
are find where I wrote it
 
06:14:01.990 --> 06:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
64 saus out of
 
06:14:07.190 --> 06:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
107 that have fewer than 1,500 students
 
06:14:09.948 --> 06:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're looking at
 
06:14:12.430 --> 06:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
60% of all the
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
saus could merge and get larger any of
 
06:14:19.750 --> 06:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
the larger ones could easily merge with
 
06:14:21.548 --> 06:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
a smaller one and they would still pick
 
06:14:25.708 --> 06:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
up the benefit of it uh up North Country
 
06:14:27.628 --> 06:14:27.638 align:start position:0%
yeah it would
 
06:14:30.430 --> 06:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
take if Berlin wasn't one of the ones
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
merging it would take all the other five
 
06:14:39.310 --> 06:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
basically to other four to get to, 1500
 
06:14:39.320 --> 06:14:41.468 align:start position:0%
basically to other four to get to, 1500
students

06:14:41.468 --> 06:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:14:45.830 --> 06:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes so would you consider an amendment
 
06:14:48.468 --> 06:14:48.478 align:start position:0%
to put the number the minimum number of
 
06:14:50.990 --> 06:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
students in a restructured district to
 
06:14:53.708 --> 06:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
be 1,200 so that more small communities
 
06:14:56.830 --> 06:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
could access this the three of us that
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill uh and one of them sits
 
06:15:04.750 --> 06:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
on the uh committee here with you uh we
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
agreed that anything above a thousand
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be a savings for most of the
 
06:15:10.000 --> 06:15:11.628 align:start position:0%
would be a savings for most of the
smaller

06:15:11.628 --> 06:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
06:15:15.948 --> 06:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
sius uh so any number in that range uh
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
we would be agreeable to if uh a change
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
was wished at the committee thank
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
06:15:28.070 --> 06:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
06:15:42.670 --> 06:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
Christina chairman L I'm withdrawing my
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%

testimony great thank you very much so I
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
have no other cards on this uh bill so

we're going to close the hearing on this
 
06:15:58.708 --> 06:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
bill and go into the last uh hearing for
 
06:15:58.718 --> 06:15:59.670 align:start position:0%
bill and go into the last uh hearing for
the

06:15:59.670 --> 06:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:16:02.350 --> 06:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
day and this is
 
06:16:04.628 --> 06:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
1195 relative to allowing school
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
districts to approve different
 
06:16:07.390 --> 06:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
apportionment methods for school
 
06:16:10.150 --> 06:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
administrative unit
 
06:16:10.160 --> 06:16:12.670 align:start position:0%
administrative unit
costs

06:16:12.670 --> 06:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
and okay we got the
 
06:16:17.430 --> 06:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
card representative
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:25.080 --> 06:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%

which includes Newington Newcastle and
 
06:16:56.948 --> 06:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
Wards 1 and five in Portsmouth
 
06:16:59.628 --> 06:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
HB 1195 essentially allows school
 
06:17:02.430 --> 06:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
districts more flexibility to implement
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
alternative funding formulas and
 
06:17:06.628 --> 06:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
apportionment methods for their saus as
 
06:17:08.670 --> 06:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
long as they're mutually agreeable to
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
the other member
 
06:17:12.830 --> 06:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
communities communities like Newington
 
06:17:15.190 --> 06:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
would like to have more flexibility to
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
discuss alternatives to the current
 
06:17:19.390 --> 06:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
state-mandated one-size fits-all SAU
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
funding model with fellow SAU
 
06:17:24.150 --> 06:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
communities the goal of the legislation
 
06:17:26.468 --> 06:17:26.478 align:start position:0%
is to better address unique tax based
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
considerations and student enrollments
 
06:17:31.110 --> 06:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
within those communities the Newington
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
Board of Selectmen has asked me to put
 
06:17:35.990 --> 06:17:36.000 align:start position:0%

06:17:42.150 --> 06:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
things like school funding apportionment
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%

technical type no okay so we'll we'll
 
06:18:05.868 --> 06:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
switch hits
 
06:18:05.878 --> 06:18:24.230 align:start position:0%
switch hits
here

06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
Paul good afternoon
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity uh my
 
06:18:31.708 --> 06:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
name is Paul desan and I am here on
 
06:18:34.190 --> 06:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the town of Newington uh I
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
will correct one uh statement made by
 
06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative M I am not an attorney uh
 
06:18:42.270 --> 06:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a staff member uh of the community
 
06:18:44.708 --> 06:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
um but with over 30 years of Municipal
 
06:18:47.708 --> 06:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
experience uh here in New Hampshire so
 
06:18:51.468 --> 06:18:51.478 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to uh read the uh uh
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
letter of support that the board of
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
selectman submitted and I just passed
 
06:18:57.310 --> 06:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
around um because there's really only
 
06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
three main points to this uh legislation
 
06:19:02.070 --> 06:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
one is that it's only enabling
 
06:19:04.510 --> 06:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
legislation stop mandating anybody to do
 
06:19:07.468 --> 06:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
anything it just corrects the SE my
 
06:19:09.590 --> 06:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
second Point what seems to be an
 
06:19:12.670 --> 06:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the current statute uh
 
06:19:16.628 --> 06:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
if you look at um 194
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
C2 uh it speaks to how you form an SIU
 
06:19:22.868 --> 06:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
how you reorganize an SIU how you
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
withdraw from an SIU and there's a
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee that's esta established and
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
and particularly under the U
 
06:19:31.230 --> 06:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
reorganizing it speaks to many different
 
06:19:34.670 --> 06:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
top topics including how to finance uh
 
06:19:39.590 --> 06:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
the SAU that's in direct conflict with
 
06:19:43.948 --> 06:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
um 94 C9 which is where this bill seeks
 
06:19:46.910 --> 06:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
to amend that is very prescriptive it
 
06:19:50.310 --> 06:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
says it must be funded one half by based
 
06:19:52.948 --> 06:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
on enrollments and one half on uh the
 
06:19:54.310 --> 06:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
assessed values of the member
 
06:19:56.468 --> 06:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
communities all we're looking for is an
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
ability to have that discussion uh and
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
allow mutually agreeable terms uh to
 
06:20:05.830 --> 06:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
fund our SAU costs uh the current
 
06:20:07.868 --> 06:20:07.878 align:start position:0%
statute although appears to give you
 
06:20:10.030 --> 06:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
that that ability because the
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
prescriptive danger of uh 94 C9 um
 
06:20:17.788 --> 06:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
you're not permitted to to really fully
 
06:20:20.430 --> 06:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
invest yourselves in that I draw that
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
parallel lastly in making my point is
 
06:20:24.750 --> 06:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
that if you go to the Cooperative uh
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
School statute uh it has very similar
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
language that what we're pro proposing
 
06:20:32.110 --> 06:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
it speaks to 1 half uh assess value one
 
06:20:35.868 --> 06:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
half enrollments or any alternative uh
 
06:20:37.190 --> 06:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
that the member communities and a
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative can agree to we're just
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
looking for that parallel construction
 
06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the SIU uh statutes so knowing
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
I'm between you and the door I'll leave
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
it at that you've had a long day and I
 
06:20:50.510 --> 06:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any questions from
 
06:20:50.520 --> 06:20:51.868 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any questions from
the

06:20:51.868 --> 06:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
06:20:56.230 --> 06:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any other pink
 
06:20:59.310 --> 06:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
cards or any testimony from anybody do
 
06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
you have anything
 
06:21:03.390 --> 06:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
Mark Mark's from the Department of
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
Education Finance was a little too late
 
06:21:09.510 --> 06:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
with my card on the last bill um but the
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
SAU merger Bill U Mark Mello Department
 
06:21:13.788 --> 06:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
of Education I was working with the
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative to add some of those
 
06:21:17.868 --> 06:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
technical changes um if you're going to
 
06:21:19.750 --> 06:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
design a grant the what I always tell
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
members of this committee is you got a
 
06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
clearly Define student um for us to
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
calculate that Grant so there's a couple
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
technical changes that um were passed
 
06:21:29.430 --> 06:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
out in front of you um to make the bill
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
um if it were to be enacted something
 
06:21:34.390 --> 06:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
the department could Implement um so I'm
 
06:21:36.190 --> 06:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
just uh available if there's any
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
technical questions on the previous
 
06:21:41.350 --> 06:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill could you explain the technical
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
thing I I don't have any so so the two
 
06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
things uh the main things were always
 
06:21:47.910 --> 06:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
defining student and so the bill as
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
introduced didn't Define adma or admr so
 
06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
always need that cleared up for us um
 
06:21:54.990 --> 06:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll take a guess um or do
 
06:21:57.270 --> 06:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
our best best guess to determine what
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
what is the student measurement um also
 
06:22:02.830 --> 06:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
chck picking a particular date and so
 
06:22:06.430 --> 06:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
the date was October 1st count um the
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
next um area we wanted cleaned up if it
 
06:22:11.868 --> 06:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
were to be enacted and become law is the
 
06:22:14.030 --> 06:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether the big District would get the
 
06:22:16.468 --> 06:22:16.478 align:start position:0%
the big SAU merging with the small SAU
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
whether both of them um would receive
 
06:22:21.230 --> 06:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
the Grant and so the proposal makes it
 
06:22:24.150 --> 06:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
clear as the sponsor um intended was
 
06:22:28.190 --> 06:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
that both saus the kind of the bigger
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
one merging with the little one both of
 
06:22:33.070 --> 06:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
them would receive the aid amount um
 
06:22:36.030 --> 06:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you represent Miler thank you
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
here what's the incident rate your
 
06:22:44.670 --> 06:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
office gets regarding school districts
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
that may want to merge or form together
 
06:22:50.590 --> 06:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
a different system is is it is it
 
06:22:54.070 --> 06:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
rampant is it isolated what what's
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that uh we do get
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
um relative
 
06:23:02.230 --> 06:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
to a portion question so there's there's
 
06:23:04.468 --> 06:23:04.478 align:start position:0%
different types of mergers so with SAU
 
06:23:08.110 --> 06:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
um the RSA 194c we do get a couple of
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
those questions um uh more like
 
06:23:12.270 --> 06:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
technical assistance questions about how
 
06:23:15.468 --> 06:23:15.478 align:start position:0%
to do that SAU assessment as far as SAU
 
06:23:19.948 --> 06:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
is discussing it's or gossiping about uh
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh merging or or or unmerging um or
 
06:23:27.070 --> 06:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
breaking up um
 
06:23:28.868 --> 06:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
it probably once a year people talk
 
06:23:30.390 --> 06:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
about it um I know I think this
 
06:23:32.708 --> 06:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee probably talks about the um
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
saus that want to merger or uh parse out
 
06:23:36.120 --> 06:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
saus that want to merger or uh parse out
uh

06:23:37.510 --> 06:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:40.910 --> 06:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh I would say probably but not but not
 
06:23:42.548 --> 06:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
that often I maybe like once or twice a
 
06:23:44.910 --> 06:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
year I would say thank you I don't think
 
06:23:48.750 --> 06:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've had many bills referencing this
 
06:23:51.430 --> 06:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
particular merger we do know that over
 
06:23:54.190 --> 06:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
in Maine where they have sads school
 
06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
administrative districts
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
the only one that merged in the last few
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
years was uh Rumford Mexico on the other
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
side of the Andrew gagen River up your
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
way represent kiss Kaden and in Vermont
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
there was a bill put forward to do this
 
06:24:13.390 --> 06:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
and they found some reverse things over
 
06:24:14.910 --> 06:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
there as a result of some the merch it
 
06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
was costing more
 
06:24:21.788 --> 06:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
money so but I don't think i' I've not
 
06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
had ail like this to merge
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
SA I don't think we've had that no no in
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
fact I think the main experience was
 
06:24:33.030 --> 06:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
really the bust that was well for rord
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
Mexico it was it's kind of logical what
 
06:24:37.670 --> 06:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
they did and of course it was increasing
 
06:24:39.270 --> 06:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
property value of course they got you
 
06:24:42.510 --> 06:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
know the the paper mill Boise and and
 
06:24:44.590 --> 06:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
then on the other side in Mexico they
 
06:24:46.430 --> 06:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
got all the retail stores like Walmart
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
Etc and they're really busting now too
 
06:24:52.270 --> 06:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
they're growing I mean I I was I knew um
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
the chair of the school board in York
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
Maine for example he and I talked about
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
this and there were all kinds of issues
 
06:25:02.070 --> 06:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
around um assess value of property and
 
06:25:05.070 --> 06:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
all that and they just they and he said
 
06:25:07.270 --> 06:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
not only their District but others did
 
06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
consider it they looked at it but it
 
06:25:12.990 --> 06:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
just was uh technically and fiscally it
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
was pretty impossible yeah so to be more
 
06:25:16.868 --> 06:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
precise in answering your question
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Miler um usually the
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
conversations are about breaking up not
 
06:25:23.788 --> 06:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
merging so in my three years with the
 
06:25:25.310 --> 06:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
Department I don't think we've had an sa
 
06:25:27.230 --> 06:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
merger more just I think we've had one
 
06:25:30.190 --> 06:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
or two saus break up um so that was
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
those conversations are usually and it
 
06:25:35.628 --> 06:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
usually stems from conversations over um
 
06:25:38.230 --> 06:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh communities uh disagreeing on the tax
 
06:25:41.628 --> 06:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
assessment um in matters like that y
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you uh chairman
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask a question on
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
1195 that's okay 119 okay that's go
 
06:25:52.510 --> 06:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
actually on right yeah
 
06:25:55.628 --> 06:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for being here um you had
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
you heard the presentation which pretty
 
06:25:59.468 --> 06:25:59.478 align:start position:0%
similar to the testimony is there
 
06:26:01.150 --> 06:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
anything you could for one the committee
 
06:26:03.070 --> 06:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
about in terms of this type of
 
06:26:06.430 --> 06:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
rearrangement of financial uh
 
06:26:08.750 --> 06:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
distributions I I don't I think I've
 
06:26:11.190 --> 06:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
studied the bill well enough to
 
06:26:16.070 --> 06:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
know what um what would happen if it was
 
06:26:19.948 --> 06:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
implemented we tend to stay out of SAU
 
06:26:24.430 --> 06:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
merger policies the only advice I give
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh when I read the law as currently
 
06:26:28.230 --> 06:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
written and I don't know how it relates
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
to this bill um
 
06:26:32.468 --> 06:26:32.478 align:start position:0%
exactly um I think I think I understand
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
from hearing the testimony but the way
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
the law Works currently is the default
 
06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
SAU agreement is half ADM half EV so you
 
06:26:43.468 --> 06:26:43.478 align:start position:0%
have to look at the alternative
 
06:26:47.708 --> 06:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
procedure and so I leave it up to towns
 
06:26:49.070 --> 06:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
and school districts and their attorneys
 
06:26:50.628 --> 06:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to adopt the
 
06:26:52.270 --> 06:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
alternative procedures but the
 
06:26:53.670 --> 06:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
alternative procedures would be putting
 
06:26:55.868 --> 06:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
a warrant article to Define an
 
06:26:58.030 --> 06:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
alternative route to the default route
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe the intent of this bill
 
06:27:03.670 --> 06:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak to it is is just um
 
06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
putting that up front because I think
 
06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the alternative procedure Pro requires a
 
06:27:10.510 --> 06:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
warant article each year and so I think
 
06:27:13.350 --> 06:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
this would I believe this bill am I I
 
06:27:15.070 --> 06:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
corrected this would allow just one war
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
article instead of ongoing War article
 
06:27:18.310 --> 06:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:27:22.590 --> 06:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the if I yes um as I understand the
 
06:27:25.350 --> 06:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
statute is that prescriptive and is only
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
the default um so so communities don't
 
06:27:30.990 --> 06:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
even have the ability to even consider a
 
06:27:34.430 --> 06:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
war article yearly annually or or or
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
whatever other term so um this is
 
06:27:39.670 --> 06:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
enabling that discussion at a local
 
06:27:42.750 --> 06:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
perod come of a local Solutions and I
 
06:27:46.590 --> 06:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't recall that the uh 9c2 requires an
 
06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
annual warrant article it once the
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
planning committee is established and it
 
06:27:53.190 --> 06:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
goes through this process and the SAU as
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
a whole adopts the amendment so the
 
06:27:56.628 --> 06:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
advice I give districts and I'm not an
 
06:27:57.868 --> 06:27:57.878 align:start position:0%
attorney I first tell them to talk to
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
their attorney but my understanding is
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
the default is always in play and as
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
soon as you form that default is
 
06:28:05.390 --> 06:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
automatically put there if you want to
 
06:28:06.628 --> 06:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
come up with an alternative procedure
 
06:28:08.350 --> 06:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
there's a different set of laws with
 
06:28:10.868 --> 06:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
alternative procedures um but my
 
06:28:12.110 --> 06:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
understanding with that alternative
 
06:28:15.468 --> 06:28:15.478 align:start position:0%
procedure is um it has a different War
 
06:28:16.910 --> 06:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
article process different from the
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
forming process so I think this
 
06:28:22.350 --> 06:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
would I yeah I can't speak to it but
 
06:28:24.190 --> 06:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
this one would this one would probably
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
this one would probably
 
06:28:28.590 --> 06:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
get back to the original forming process
 
06:28:30.750 --> 06:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to study it a little bit
 
06:28:30.760 --> 06:28:32.430 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to study it a little bit
further

06:28:32.430 --> 06:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
to thank you very much Mark further
 
06:28:38.270 --> 06:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions ref C scen I don't if I can go
 
06:28:39.868 --> 06:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
back but it's a question to Mark was
 
06:28:43.310 --> 06:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
there a fiscal note on 1579 did I uh
 
06:28:46.948 --> 06:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
that sorry it's likely in the process um
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know where it is in the process
 
06:28:49.628 --> 06:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
I do have fisal
 
06:28:51.830 --> 06:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
note I went through the new on and we
 
06:28:54.270 --> 06:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
didn't get that today okay so yeah it's
 
06:28:57.868 --> 06:28:57.878 align:start position:0%
definitely not a the bill uh I ran some
 
06:28:57.878 --> 06:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
definitely not a the bill uh I ran some
numbers

06:28:59.750 --> 06:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
06:28:59.760 --> 06:29:01.390 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

06:29:01.390 --> 06:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:05.628 --> 06:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh about 40,000 I I think the most
 
06:29:07.948 --> 06:29:07.958 align:start position:0%
amount of students say if every small
 
06:29:07.958 --> 06:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
amount of students say if every small
SAU

06:29:09.510 --> 06:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
06:29:12.548 --> 06:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
joined um the highest amount of a grant
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
awarded in one year would be 8 million
 
06:29:19.230 --> 06:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of saus would struggle
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
to come up together and and merge so I
 
06:29:24.868 --> 06:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
don't know um how many people would
 
06:29:27.150 --> 06:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
apply for the grant because I think one
 
06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh the 1500 uh student thresholds are
 
06:29:32.110 --> 06:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
going to be challenging um based just
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
what based on the map of small saus we
 
06:29:38.150 --> 06:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
have currently um but if Manchester
 
06:29:40.150 --> 06:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
picked up another school district that
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
would cost a lot um because all those
 
06:29:43.990 --> 06:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester students would be getting Aid
 
06:29:46.310 --> 06:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
per pupil so it's it's absolutely
 
06:29:49.708 --> 06:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
indeterminable um but uh so that that
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
would be the fiscal note but I would I
 
06:29:52.830 --> 06:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
would um if if you made this over to
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
house finance I would just tell them to
 
06:29:56.430 --> 06:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
put some money in the education trust
 
06:29:59.708 --> 06:29:59.718 align:start position:0%
fund in case anyone applies for this boy
 
06:30:00.910 --> 06:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have that much money in the
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
fund over $200 million is that somewhere
 
06:30:07.670 --> 06:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
around there right 161 161 y
 
06:30:07.680 --> 06:30:10.670 align:start position:0%
around there right 161 161 y
okay

06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:30:12.990 --> 06:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much Mark
 
06:30:15.110 --> 06:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh I don't think we have
 
06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
any other cards so we're going to close
 
06:30:19.070 --> 06:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
this hearing and close our work for the
 
06:30:22.070 --> 06:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
day and we will be back the day after
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
tomorrow tomorrow's voting day everybody
 
06:30:27.510 --> 06:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that
 
06:30:31.468 --> 06:30:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:53.760 --> 06:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
for
