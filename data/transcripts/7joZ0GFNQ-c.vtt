01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone welcome back
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
from lunch
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
hope you had a pleasant one
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
time to resume our public hearings we're
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
now going to open the public hearing on
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is also one of the early bills
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
assigned to our committee which means we
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
have to complete our work on this bill
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and report out on it by the 17th of
 
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.669 align:start position:0%
and report out on it by the 17th of
february

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
with that said i'd like to now introduce
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
committee member rebecca mcwilliams to
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
introduce the legislation
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair bose and
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
esteemed members colleagues of the
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
it is my absolute pleasure to be here
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
today to introduce bill 1506
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be an enabling
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislation bill
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
i am proposing this bill to create a
 
01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
i am proposing this bill to create a
fund

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
this is a self-funding fund
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
it uses no monies from the state of new
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's meant to be revolving
 
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's meant to be revolving
and

01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
fund itself through the years
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
by giving out loans collecting interest
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
on those loans and then returning the
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
money back to the fund to be reused
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
again in the future
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to go through it
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
briefly with you to highlight some of
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
the important pieces that i've
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
introduced um i would certainly welcome
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions on this once i'm complete and
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
i want to apologize but i do have to zip
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
out of here at 1 30 to introduce another
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill downstairs so i'll be as brief as i
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
possibly can to get through this
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
let's start at the top
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
the definition section of this bill the
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
focus here is really on just defining
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
some of the terms that we're looking to
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
fund with this revolving clean energy
 
01:47:37.679 --> 01:47:38.709 align:start position:0%
fund with this revolving clean energy
fund

01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
first is alternative fuel vehicles i
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
know we've had some interesting
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
discussions in this committee about
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
hydrogen vehicles
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly those are included in the
 
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.910 align:start position:0%
certainly those are included in the
definition

01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at zero emissions
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles and of course hybrids
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this pretty
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
extensively in prior hearings but just
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
as a reminder
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
there certainly seems to be a trend in
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
transportation to be moving away from
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
diesel and gasoline and so this fund is
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
looking to provide some kind of
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
financing incentive for places like
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities here would be a good
 
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
municipalities here would be a good
example

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
if the city of franklin decided that
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted to go
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
zero emissions with their school buses
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is the sort of fun that they would
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
look to
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
for a zero or low interest loan in order
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
to do that and payback turns up up to 30
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
years once again we're not talking about
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
state funds to provide this this would
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
be funded from either federal government
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
funds private funds
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
or other sources of money
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going through the definitions just a
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
little bit further
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
we've talked quite a bit about energy
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
efficiency in this committee
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
so obviously if you have an existing
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
building perhaps once again i'll just
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
use franklin as an example you have a
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
school that needs to be insulated this
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
is the sort of fund where the town of
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
franklin could come to the fund and
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
request a certain amount of money in
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
order to do insulation projects on an
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've talked about greenhouse gases
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
and obviously the goal here is to reduce
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases by moving to
 
01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.390 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases by moving to
incentivize

01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
certainly micro grids would be a
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
potential project if you have
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
say a non-profit that wants to
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
get together and create a micro grid and
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
is asking for a loan in order to do so
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
that would be something that the
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy would consider
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps award them alone in order to
 
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
then kind of moving down
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
we've got all kinds of qualified
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
projects which would include solar
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
window geothermal
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
certainly there are some types of
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
technology that we can't even imagine 10
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
years from now be maybe the hot new
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.709 align:start position:0%
years from now be maybe the hot new
thing

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i do think that hydrogen vehicles
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
may be one of those
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
so the fund is intended to be flexible
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
enough so that as it's self-funding and
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
moving through the next 10 to 20 years
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're not ruling out certain types of
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
technology that have not become
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
mainstream today but may be mainstream
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna skip ahead to page
 
01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.430 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna skip ahead to page
three

01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a really important part of the
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of defining
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
who um
 
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
who we're intending to benefit with this
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
revolving clean energy fund
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
i've defined vulnerable communities
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
using the federal department of housing
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
and urban development guidelines
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about a low-income
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
community and as written and introduced
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does prioritize 40 of funds
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
annually to go to
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
projects that are in low-income
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about hud guidelines
 
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:51.590 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about hud guidelines
um

01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
and in addition uh we we do want to make
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
sure that some of these areas as we've
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony at this committee
 
01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps already are in a community where
 
01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.790 align:start position:0%
perhaps already are in a community where
they're

01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're having compromised air quality
 
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be something to consider
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at okay this is a
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
community that is
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
currently breathing in some kind of
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
contaminated air
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps we want to make sure that we can
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
give them some funding to offset that
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
concern for health issues in the long
 
01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
concern for health issues in the long
term

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
the idea here is to incentivize
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
low and zero greenhouse gas emission
 
01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.589 align:start position:0%
low and zero greenhouse gas emission
projects

01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
these finance tools that we're creating
 
01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.229 align:start position:0%
these finance tools that we're creating
here

01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
could include a match from the private
 
01:51:44.719 --> 01:51:45.669 align:start position:0%
could include a match from the private
sector

01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
sector
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at perhaps we have banks
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
who would be interested in investing in
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
a community project could be school
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
buses for franklin
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
and would be willing to provide matching
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
funds with the same terms as the loan in
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
order to double the impact
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
through this enabling vehicle to have a
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
bucket to receive funds and apply them
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
i already mentioned that 40 percent of
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
investment activity of the fund is
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
directed to serve vulnerable communities
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
as defined with the head hud guidelines
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i i do want to draw your attention
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
to page four uh this is clause
 
01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
to page four uh this is clause
six

01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's written vi roman numeral vi clause
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
six page four
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the goal here is low interest and
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
zero interest loans and this is not a
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
mandate it says the department shall
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
explore establish a program
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
to provide low interest and zero
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
interest loans up to 30 years in length
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
to any school
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
municipal planning organization or
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
non-profit seeking financing for the
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
acquisition of zero greenhouse gas
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
emissions vehicle fleets
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
or associated infrastructure think
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
charging stations perhaps
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
to support zero greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle fleets so really this is meant
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
to kick off what we see as the next step
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
in transportation
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
for all of our communities but
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
really incentivizing our municipalities
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and access this
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
kind of loan funds
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
i did include a clause
 
01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.550 align:start position:0%
i did include a clause
about

01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
for projects over a hundred thousand
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
dollars that may be a little aggressive
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're gonna get there in
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
year one through five but if the fund
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
gets that big that they can give out
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
funds of a hundred thousand dollars then
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
for construction i think it makes sense
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
to stay at prevailing wage
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
since the fund is administered by the
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and then finally the requirements
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
of energy create publicly available
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
reports i'm on page five at the top
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
describing um
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
what happened with the fund this year
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
what was it spent on what was the return
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
what was the interest what are our loan
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
terms and what percentage are we getting
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
back for these capital investments
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
it also allows the department of energy
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
to accept and use philanthropic funds so
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
i know we do have a couple of tech
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
billionaires in new hampshire and i
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
would invite them
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
verbally to please donate to kick off
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
this accelerator fund because i think
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is the future of the state
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and just a note on the fiscal note which
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the last page of your handout um
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't have a commitment
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
right now from our federal delegation
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a bill signed from
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
washington saying
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
let's send money to new hampshire for
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
new clean tech projects but the idea of
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is to create a bucket so that
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
we are ready when that happens
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the funds can come in here and be
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
administered by the department of energy
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take questions
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
and once again i just want to remind you
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative uh
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
bernardi uh by the way uh representative
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
mick williams thank you for
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh a thorough explanation of the bill
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for submitting the bill and
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
helping us understand what it's all
 
01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
helping us understand what it's all
about

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative bernardi is recognized
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
for a comment
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman paulson uh thank you
 
01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:25.830 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman paulson uh thank you
mr

01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.910 align:start position:0%
mr
mcwilliams

01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
mcwilliams
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
so since none of this is requiring state
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
funds why can't this entire program be
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
done by a non-profit you set up a
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
non-profit to do this and you don't need
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
any legislation at all to move forward
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the federal government
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
would give the funds to a non-profit i
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
do believe the federal government would
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
give the funds to our department of
 
01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.149 align:start position:0%
give the funds to our department of
energy

01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.189 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
follow-up

01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:58.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's true i think the
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
federal government has given all kinds
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
of funds to various non-profits with
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
specific uh jurisdictional
 
01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
specific uh jurisdictional
uh

01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
claims made as part of their charter
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
sure so when you talk about a non-profit
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
receiving funds from the federal
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
government there's typically an rfp
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
process with a grant application correct
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about you know let's
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
just call it the green fund the new
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire green fund it's a new
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
nonprofit newly created
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government puts out an rfp
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and says we're going to
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
create potential grants up to
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
x dollars you can compete and apply
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
submit your application get the funds
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
and then do what we allow you to do
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
within the rfp rules so that would be a
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
small slice
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
of what is potentially available as
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
directed to the state of new hampshire
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
through larger federal legislation so
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
what you're describing would be taking
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
maybe a 16th of a slice of the pizza pie
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
when really what i'd like is the pizza
 
01:56:58.159 --> 01:57:04.950 align:start position:0%
when really what i'd like is the pizza
pie

01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative fletch is recognized
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative williams i'm reading
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
through this bill
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
and on page three i see vulnerable
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
communities and the first two are income
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
based and then the third one you say
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
communities of color and tribal
 
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.709 align:start position:0%
communities of color and tribal
communities

01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
which include a geographically distinct
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
area with the population of colors
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
higher than the average population of
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
color of the state how does color make a
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
page three this is uh section three
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
communities of color and tribal
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
communities yes okay
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about is
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
historically marginalized communities
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
we do have a long track record as
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
the united states of america and to a
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
lesser extent as the state of new
 
01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.589 align:start position:0%
lesser extent as the state of new
hampshire

01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
for marginalizing communities of color
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
and putting them in a position where
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
they have less access to real estate
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
less access to shared benefits such as
 
01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.030 align:start position:0%
less access to shared benefits such as
schools

01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
parks open space
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
and so the intent here is to make sure
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we are prioritizing rectifying past
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
wrongs by addressing the history of how
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
we have addressed communities of color
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
could you give me an example
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
so redlining in terms of allowing
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
highways to come through areas that were
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
considered to be
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
communities of color
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
when we set up our zoning
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
or zoning in new hampshire has been
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
based on single-family residences one to
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
two acre minimums
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would be considered the antithesis
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's on that it's on now okay thank you
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman they take my
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
question following up on that i'm trying
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
to figure this out what is a community
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
of color
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh how do you define that is it based on
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
race national origin or what because if
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
it is based on either of those it seems
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
to me it's distinctly unconstitutional
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
because we have provisions in both the
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and united states
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
constitution that you don't discriminate
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
on the basis of race or national origin
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
so what is the community of color if
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not based on at least partly based
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
on those things
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i think it's pretty clear here when
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
we look at census data i'm sorry i
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand what jesus said let
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
me move my microphone closer
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
when we look at census data
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
self-reported by people who respond to
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the 10-year census
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
we have data for new hampshire showing
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
that there are communities where people
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
report to be
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
not white correct
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's self-reported in the census data so
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a municipality where
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent has reported
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
self-reported as not white
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
according to the terms of this
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
introduced bill
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
that would fall into a
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
distinct area in which the population of
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
color is higher than the average
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
population of color in the state
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
up mr chairman follow up okay uh well
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
first of all not following your logic
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
lightly because you talked about over 50
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
and let's be quite honest about it no
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
matter how you define
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
broadly defined communities of color we
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't have 50 percent of communities of
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
color in new hampshire so it's more like
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
five or six percent would be the
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
statewide average or maybe 10
 
02:00:17.199 --> 02:00:18.149 align:start position:0%
statewide average or maybe 10
so

02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
but even it's what you just said getting
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
back to it says they define themselves
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
as non-white so it's racially based so
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to say based on the
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
community's racial makeup they may or
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
may not qualify for additional money how
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that constitutional
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i mentioned earlier to representative
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
plett's question we're talking about
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
rectifying past wrongs to communities of
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
color who have been marginalized and
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
with our own policies we have created it
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to accumulate
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
generational wealth i know that was in
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
the constitutional issue so we're
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
talking about rectifying a past wrong
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
when you try to use a constitutional
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
argument what you're saying is
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
when we look to the letter of the law
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's how we should behave but when we
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
look to history we see that that's not
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
how we have historically behaved
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington you weren't
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
here this morning
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
but i went over the ground rules for the
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
committee this morning and one of the
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
ground rules is we do not debate
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
people when they're testifying on bills
 
02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.589 align:start position:0%
people when they're testifying on bills
so

02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time for that in our
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and in our executive
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
sessions so just refine confine yourself
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
to questions please thank you
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.679 --> 02:01:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how this fund is going to
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
work if you have
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
and you give out ten thousand dollars
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take twenty
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
to thirty years to pay it back
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
does that mean you need ten thousand
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
dollars every year for twenty or thirty
 
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
dollars every year for twenty or thirty
years

02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
to catch up in other words as as people
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
pay back
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to add back to the fund
 
02:02:01.199 --> 02:02:03.030 align:start position:0%
you're going to add back to the fund
correct

02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
so maybe i'm wrong okay i think you're
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
asking about how it's administered if
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
the full value of the fund was ten
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it would not be
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
possible to give out the ten thousand in
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
one year because that's the full value
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the fund
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
you have to hold money back in the fund
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
in order to accumulate interest
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
and keep it going and also be collecting
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
loan interest from small loans that
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
you've made out so from an accounting
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
perspective you can't possibly give out
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
the full value of the fund each year in
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
order for it to be a revolving fund it
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
would be more like three to four
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
thousand that you'd give out in one year
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
and then start collecting that interest
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
and additional funds from other sources
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up so you would need
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
to add
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether it be ten thousand or a million
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
or ten million you'd need to add to that
 
02:02:58.639 --> 02:02:59.669 align:start position:0%
or ten million you'd need to add to that
fund

02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be just the interest that's
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
coming back you would need to add
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
more capital
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about a startup
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
right this is the your first year of a
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
revolving fund
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you had a hundred thousand which i
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
think is probably a more realistic
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
starting number than ten thousand
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
you would probably be giving out some
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
smaller percentage and i don't play an
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
accountant on tv
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
but you would be giving out a smaller
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
percentage in year one and also actively
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
working to solicit donations
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
and collect interest on the loans you've
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
given out in order to sustain the fund
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned in the fiscal note
 
02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
so i want to mention it here in
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
testimony you would also need to be
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
paying even if it's a part-time salary
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
for someone to administer the finances
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the fund so within the department of
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
energy i imagine there would be at least
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
a part-time person who would be
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering this fund
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
and their salary would be taken from the
 
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:00.870 align:start position:0%
and their salary would be taken from the
fund

02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
so it is a bit of a balancing act to
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
kick it off and start
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we start slow but really it
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
depends on how much money is in the pot
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
in order to do that you certainly don't
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to exhaust the pot by giving out
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
the full amount
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
but you want to be realistic about
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
economy and market growth and where you
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
can get your money back from a
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
short-term loan with perhaps higher
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliams for bringing
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um i know you have to run my
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
question also has to do with the funding
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like it's a little bit
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
of a chicken and egg when i'm reading
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that um you know we
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't have any money to start it up but
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
until we have the bucket that you talked
 
02:04:49.599 --> 02:04:50.629 align:start position:0%
until we have the bucket that you talked
about

02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
we also can't go start soliciting money
 
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
for the green bank concept so i wonder
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh speak to
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
where you got the idea or if you know of
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
other green banks
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
regionally or
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
wherever that could give us an example
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
of how this works in practice
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i think you can just look to our
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
neighbor maine
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
for a similar program which they enacted
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
so maine has a newly started green bank
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
but instead of focusing their efforts on
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities and non-profits maine has
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
actually been providing individual loans
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
to individuals who own residences and
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
would like to upgrade to heat pumps
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a very different approach to
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
provide loans to individuals as a bank
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
rather than providing loans to larger
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
entities so it's really a question of
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to affect with a
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
green bank
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think maine has done a good job of in
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
very small instances with small loans
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting across the finish line but
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
knowing that if it is a 10-year term
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're not going to see their return
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
for quite some time
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman follow up
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
yes and so in that light uh has the
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
department of energy i think they're
 
02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
here and they i don't know if they're
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to testify but have they given you
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
any input in terms of how they would
 
02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
any input in terms of how they would
view

02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
view
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh who who would be the recipients
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
because i think your bill tries to
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
specify that
 
02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.030 align:start position:0%
specify that
but

02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes would they also have
 
02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
input as to how
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
loans would be administered since the
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy would be the
 
02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.550 align:start position:0%
department of energy would be the
administrator

02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
well the way this bill is written
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
it gives great latitude to the
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy to looking into
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
different projects different ways to
 
02:06:30.239 --> 02:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
different projects different ways to
fund

02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
and different incentivizing mechanisms
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
so it certainly gives
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy the ability to
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
do that i have not had any individual
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
conversations and i am sincerely looking
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
forward to the department of energy's
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
because as i said it would create
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
another position that would be funded by
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
the revolving fund thank you
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i know you uh you have to run
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's 122 that clock is fast
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i have just one quick question on
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
my fat fingers can turn the page the
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
clean energy and sustainability
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
accelerator fund is that a fund that
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
exists today or is that
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
a fund that may be
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
being proposed in legislation that
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't been federal legislation that
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't been passed yet you know exactly
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
what that
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
can you just point out where it is in
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note i'm sorry i'm trying to
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
find it
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me at the very bottom of the
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
table in the fiscal note
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
where it says funding source
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
it checks the box called other and then
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
beside that it says clean energy and
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability accelerator fund
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know what that is so hypothetically
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
if there were a national nonprofit
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
that was a clean energy and
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability accelerator it could
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
donate to this
 
02:08:03.679 --> 02:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
donate to this
bucket

02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
bucket
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.069 align:start position:0%
bucket
and

02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
we know that there is federal
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislation currently in debate
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
to fund energy projects in different
 
02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
to fund energy projects in different
states

02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
so those two buckets either non-profit
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
donations into or federal money coming
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
into would potentially be funding
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
sources for this fund
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you the the way this is
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
written it sounds like it's the actual
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
name of an existing fund or a proposed
 
02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
name of an existing fund or a proposed
fund

02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
and i'd be interested to know whether
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's existing or proposed we will find
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
that one question for department of
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
energy okay okay thank you
 
02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.149 align:start position:0%
energy okay okay thank you
um

02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative samsic would like a
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
question if you have time
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative mc williams
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
listening to you it reminds me of
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
how very successful so-called micro
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
loans have been all over the world
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that financial institutions now are
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
very interested in doing that because
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
they usually never default and are very
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
effective do you see any analogy between
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
a fund like this and how micro loans are
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
are handled
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
certainly i think this is drafted along
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
the lines of how a micro loan could be
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
handled but once again there's wide
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
latitude for how the department of
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
energy decides to administer this
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it could be done in a very similar
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
way to micro loans with decent interest
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
rates very short term payback when you
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
say micro loan it's usually less than a
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
year payback
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
which i think would be to representative
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
kelly pitt's question very helpful to
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
have the funds coming back for a project
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mick
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
williams for an excellent introduction
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill and good luck with your
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent introduction thank you very
 
02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.390 align:start position:0%
subsequent introduction thank you very
much

02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
all right i would like to next call on
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
josie gage representing the office of
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer advocate she's requested uh
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
five minutes to testify on this bill and
 
02:10:04.079 --> 02:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
five minutes to testify on this bill and
has

02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
handed out written testimony to all of
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
us so ms gage
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you for being
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
here good afternoon and thank you
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
my name is josie gage and i'm director
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
of economics and finance at the office
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the consumer advocate
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
this is my first time testimony
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
testifying before this committee so
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
please forgive me for reading
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony um for anyone who
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't already know the office of the
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate represents the
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility rate
 
02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility rate
payers

02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
payers
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of this bill
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the oca believes that this bill is
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
good for residential ratepayers as it
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
provides capital for clean energy
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
technologies energy efficiency and
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
sustainability measures without relying
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
on ratepayers to fund the various
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
possible innovations
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
whether you believe in global warming
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
climate change or any related crises
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
it can be agreed upon that innovation is
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
economically worthy of attention as well
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
as the fact that it is penny wise
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
to use every bit of energy carefully
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
who's mother hasn't told us we're not
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
heating the outdoors
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
or to turn off lights when you're not in
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
the room
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter matter whether you
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
feel affinity for saving the environment
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
from demise or whether you follow your
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the current instance you have the
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create an accelerator
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
fund that doesn't cost new hampshire's
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
ratepayers further
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
and through which rate payers stand to
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
benefit from investment in technology
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and sustainability
 
02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:46.629 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and sustainability
efforts

02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
further this bill will presumably limit
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
increases in funds needed through system
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
benefits charges related to the hotly
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
debated energy efficiency resource
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
standard and its triennium planning
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
additionally the amount to which new
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire is home to energy technologies
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
that reduce its dependence on wholesale
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
energy markets
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
the lower overall energy costs in new
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire will be
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is the most
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
dependent state
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
on iso new england pricing and because
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire must make up for what it
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
lacks in distributed generation
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
generation resources our ratepayers pay
 
02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
generation resources our ratepayers pay
disproportionately

02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
more money overall for energy
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
the types of investments presented in
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
this bill aid in resetting the balance
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
such that new hampshire's rate payers
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
can reach equal footing with those on
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
our borders
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
it is it is the oca's opinion that a
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
prudently managed finance program that
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
directs investment toward efforts to
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire even more
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining while not needing to
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
change rate to charge rate payers is in
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
everyone's self-interest
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing your time with me
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington has a
 
02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington has a
question

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question um
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
just try to make this quick there's a
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
second and last paragraph there you said
 
02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
second and last paragraph there you said
that

02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is the most
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
dependent state on iso new england
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
pricing and because new hampshire must
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
make up for what it lacks on distributed
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
generation sources our rate pay is paid
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
disproportionately more money
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
overall for energy could you present
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
some facts to back that up with some
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
figures i'm not saying right off the top
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
of your head today but if you could
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
submit them to the committee because
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty bold statement that i've
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
never heard before i'm not even sure
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
what it means we're the most dependent
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
state on iso new england pricing since
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
all states
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
are that other than extreme northern
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
maine so if you could get back to us
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
with an explanation of that paragraph
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate it
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:01.679 --> 02:14:02.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions for ms gage
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you ms gage for your
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i would like now to call on
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
griffin roberge from the department of
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
griffin did not uh indicate that he
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
needed any particular amount of time
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
but he will answer questions if needed
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here griffin thank
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
for the record uh griffin roberge from
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of energy
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned this morning uh three
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
days into the new job so if you could
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
give me just a little bit of rope here
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
um what was it um
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
testify on house bill 1506
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on this
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill as written however and i didn't
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
indicate on the pink slip but
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'll do it here i just wanted to
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
indicate some
 
02:15:03.679 --> 02:15:05.109 align:start position:0%
indicate some
technical

02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
technical
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that we wanted to raise
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
obviously as expressed in the fiscal
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
note i think the department is operating
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
under the assumption that
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
the fund would be capitalized by funds
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
from national clean energy and
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
sustainability accelerators federal
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
grant funds or gifts as i think the
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of there has been
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
02:15:25.709 --> 02:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
discussions in washington on a
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
reconciliation bill
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
and while there are discussions in
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
washington about providing such federal
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
funding for clean energy and
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability accelerators nothing has
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
been signed into law to date
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
going through the bill
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
requires the department to do in regards
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
to the fund
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
per the fiscal note the department does
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
not currently administer any loan
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
programs directly
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and does not monitor local wages
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
therefore these new duties could not be
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
absorbed by existing staff nor could
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
these duties be paid for by utility
 
02:15:59.119 --> 02:16:01.589 align:start position:0%
these duties be paid for by utility
assessment

02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
there i am specifically referencing page
 
02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
there i am specifically referencing page
4

02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
4
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
lines 27 to 30 where it references um
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring local wages and that type of
 
02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
monitoring local wages and that type of
thing

02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
and again we don't monit we don't manage
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
any active
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
loan programs as i think the committee
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
is aware of we do oversee
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund but those are
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
largely grant driven
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of other technical
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
concerns i wanted to raise is at least
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
again on page 4
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
lines 22
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what the department should
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
do if there's a conflict between those
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
two provisions so
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
line 22 references that the department
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
shall maximize the reduction of
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions in this state
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
for every dollar deployed by the fund
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
and then line 25 says the department
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
shall ensure that 40 of investment
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
activity from the fund is directed to
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
serve vulnerable communities so for
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
example what if in order to attain a
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
maximum reduction in greenhouse gas
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
emissions you know there needs to be a
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
less than 40 percent of investment
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
activity that's left available to serve
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations that's one
 
02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.429 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations that's one
um

02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
second concern um on page
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
apologies page four
 
02:17:26.559 --> 02:17:27.509 align:start position:0%
apologies page four
um

02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
line 34 a little bit
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
to borrow from representative mcgee kind
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
of chicken and egg situation kind of
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
develops um the department can only pay
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
staff on income from loans that have
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
been issued but in order to review
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
applications and to make loan awards the
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
department needs to hire staff
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if other types of funding
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
would allow the department to pay for
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
staff from the capitalized fund and
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
again depending on what the federal
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislation says i can't speak for
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
certain as to whether or not the federal
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
law would allow
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
funds to be used to pay for state staff
 
02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
funds to be used to pay for state staff
um

02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
and another observation is in general
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
it's not clear from the language of the
 
02:18:06.399 --> 02:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
it's not clear from the language of the
bill

02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
if the department would be permitted to
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
enter into a contract
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
for loan servicing with a third party
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
such as community development finance
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
authority the business finance authority
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
a credit union or a bank
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't provide the department
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
with any specific rulemaking under rsa
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
541-a to establish the details of the
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
loan fund such as interest rate setting
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
process loan term excuse me loan terms
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
application forms
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
annual rounds versus rolling
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
applications type of thing um
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah those are at least just the
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
immediate observations of the department
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
and certainly willing to answer any
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
questions if need be
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony well
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that testimony
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something that i thought
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
was quite interesting the business
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
finance authority currently implements a
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
revolving loan fund that is funded by
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
reggie funds
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
and is administered to pay for energy
 
02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
and is administered to pay for energy
efficiency

02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
project loans to municipalities and
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
with this kind of a green accelerator
 
02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
with this kind of a green accelerator
fund

02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
find a better home in the business
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
finance authority than in the department
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
of energy i i i guess i would defer to
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
the to the prime sponsors to what her
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
intentions are with that language
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
again just from the language as as it's
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
it puts a lot of this the burden of
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
managing the fund on the department so
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
but the language isn't clear as to
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not the department would be
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
in would be able to enter into a
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
contract with say the business finance
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
authority to manage funds like that
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that the reason i
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
brought that up is because the bfa does
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
have the staff to do that they're
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
already doing it for several other kinds
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
of revolving funds and so yeah and again
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that's something subject to the
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill as to what they
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
want to do it's just a
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
technical concern that the department
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
raised in reviewing the bill
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett is recognized
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
for a question yes thank you mr chairman
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as clerk
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
you had uh covered quite a few points
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
there i never took shorthand in school
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
do you have uh
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
written notes that you could share i
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
could certainly show them after the
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee via email as the former aide
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
to the senate energy and natural
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
resources committee and taking notes i
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
can certainly understand some difficulty
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
in doing that so yes i can forward that
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions for mr
 
02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:45.190 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions for mr
roberge

roberge
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
shorthand i'd have to look through the
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
bill to to do a deeper dive but it off
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i didn't see it i'm
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
not saying it's not there i'm just
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
saying i couldn't answer your question
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
mr roberge
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'll thank you mr roberge for your

this is another of the early bills
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
that our committee must complete its
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
work on by the 17th of february but
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
before i introduce the prime sponsor
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
i wanted to read something that i just
 
02:45:36.319 --> 02:45:37.190 align:start position:0%
i wanted to read something that i just
got

02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:38.230 align:start position:0%
got
from

02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:39.750 align:start position:0%
from
the

02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
deputy legislative budget assistant
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
in the office of the legislative budget
 
02:45:45.439 --> 02:45:46.790 align:start position:0%
in the office of the legislative budget
assistant

02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
says good morning chairman votes and
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
we noticed that hb 1419 which is a bill
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier this morning
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note attached to the bill
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note was attached in error
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
and was intended for an earlier version
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill during the lsr phase
 
02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced no longer
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
contains an appropriation therefore the
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
attached fiscal note is not needed
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
sorry for the confusion that this might
 
02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:18.710 align:start position:0%
sorry for the confusion that this might
cause

02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
so that answers the questions or some of
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question because it
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't have an fn after it had a dash
 
02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
it didn't have an fn after it had a dash
a

02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's almost a good bill okay
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right so let's move on to 1601 and i
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
would like to recognize
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh the ranking member
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative peter sabsitz to
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill to us
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
committee

02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.590 align:start position:0%
committee
um

02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
i have some
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
short uh written comments and i handed
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
copies out to everyone i believe who's
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
um so the purpose of this bill is to
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that as the reggie auction price
 
02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
ensure that as the reggie auction price
increases

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
increases
 
02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
so too will the proceeds that are
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the energy efficiency fund
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
which are used to fund energy efficiency
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
programs and low-income energy
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency measures administered by new
 
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire safes
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
currently the first dollar from each
 
02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
reggie allowance is allocated to the
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency fund
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
while the remaining proceeds are rebated
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
to electricity rate payers
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
according to a letter this committee
 
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
recently received from former puc chair
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
diane martin
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
the price of those allowances is
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
projected to increase significantly
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps doubling in the next several
 
02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.269 align:start position:0%
perhaps doubling in the next several
years

02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
however if such an increase occurs
 
02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
the revenue allocated to the energy
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency fund will not increase
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
since it is based on that one dollar
 
02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:12.389 align:start position:0%
since it is based on that one dollar
allocation

02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
instead of a percentage of the allowance
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
price that is why this bill proposes to
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
change the one dollar allocation to a 15
 
02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
change the one dollar allocation to a 15
percent

02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
allocation of the allowance price
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
since a 15 allowance for the 2021 reggie
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
allowance price would result
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
in a revenue for the energy efficiency
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
fund of 4.9 million
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
in contrast to the current 3.46 million
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
which is equal to 11 percent currently
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
the bill would set a floor for the for
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
future revenues at that 4.9 million
 
02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.110 align:start position:0%
future revenues at that 4.9 million
level

02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
if a 15 take of future allowances is
 
02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:55.830 align:start position:0%
if a 15 take of future allowances is
higher

02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
higher
 
02:48:55.840 --> 02:48:56.630 align:start position:0%
higher
the

02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency fund would receive
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
higher allocation amounts however that
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
allocation would not sink below that 4.9
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
million floor set in 2021
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
since the purpose of the reggie system
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
was to assist in funding energy
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
it only makes sense that when reggie
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
allowance prices go up so does the
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
funding for energy efficiency programs
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
the amount being rebated likewise will
 
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
rise as the reggie allowance price
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
increases as well
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to point out that some of
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
this information is on the
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note table
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh on uh
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
right below the uh
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
the uh category of methyl methodology
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see that currently
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
according to
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh this fiscal note
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
under the current law we have a 33
 
02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
worth of auction proceeds
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
there is a administrative cost of 0.35
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
million that's deducted
 
02:50:06.269 --> 02:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
and the remainder
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
32.65 million is distributed
 
02:50:13.389 --> 02:50:13.399 align:start position:0%
and the energy efficiency fund receives
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
3.46 million dollars currently
 
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
which which
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
is equivalent to about 11
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the current allowance price that is
 
02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
being used for this calculation
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
and because i assumed according to uh
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
chairwoman martin's comments that those
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
allowance prices will go up
 
02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.590 align:start position:0%
allowance prices will go up
significantly

02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
i thought it only prudent that the
 
02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency fund also receives
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
more money and not stay at the current
 
02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:44.469 align:start position:0%
more money and not stay at the current
level

02:50:44.469 --> 02:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:50:46.230 --> 02:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
which it would do if we just kept the
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
one one dollar allocation
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
i did suggest 15
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
which if you can see in the second
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
column there under proposed amendment if
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
if we had 15 percent now in place that
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh a bit one and a half million
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
dollars more for the energy efficiency
 
02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:05.110 align:start position:0%
dollars more for the energy efficiency
fund

02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
than is now the case
 
02:51:09.750 --> 02:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
but i am setting that just basically as
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
a floor so that in the future if there's
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
if the revenues are or the allowance
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
price is not high enough
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
it would never drop below that 4.9
 
02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:21.190 align:start position:0%
it would never drop below that 4.9
million

02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh floor
 
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
all my testimony and i'm going to
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
entertain questions
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
answer okay thank you representative
 
02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
sausage for
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
this interesting bill and for
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
introducing it to us uh representative
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
plett is recognized for a question
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair is there anything
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
magic about the 15 percent there's
 
02:51:47.429 --> 02:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
something you
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
pull out of the air to get the numbers
 
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
you want
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative platt for
 
02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
that question no there's nothing magical
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
about it except that when i put together
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
the lsr initially
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
the allowance price that i was aware of
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
was a different price
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
the one dollar would have equated to 15
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
percent at the time
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't know what the number was that
 
02:52:14.469 --> 02:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
the the department was calculating using
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh but at the time i was using a
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
difference allowance price and that's
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
how i came up with the 15
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
it could be lower like i said right now
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's 11 based on their allowance price
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
but that's not a magical number at all
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a number that can be
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
changed modified
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the future or whenever no
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
question representative um just a
 
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
question on the the
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
second paragraph there at the end it
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
says however that allocation would not
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
sink below the 4.9 million so the regi
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
system was set up to basically
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
try to get rid of fossil fuel we use
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
less fossil fuel generation so if that
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
goal is met in as we go into the future
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be less reggie money so
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
what happens if the money goes down and
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
it sinks below that amount and there
 
02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
just be less rebate to the rate payers
 
02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
like we do now
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you ursula harrington for the
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
question can you just clarify when you
 
02:53:20.230 --> 02:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
say going down are you talking about the
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
allowance price going down or the total
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes in going down
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
well the total revenue going down in the
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
future well well the reason i ask that
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
is because as you can see from
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
comments here on the on the fiscal note
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
that that allowance amount is scheduled
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
to decrease every year
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
so you've got decreasing allowances
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
every year and then you've got the issue
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the allowance price
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
so both together give you the revenue so
 
02:53:50.230 --> 02:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
when you say if it goes down
 
02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
are you saying if the allowance price
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
goes down or maybe you can just clarify
 
02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if the you you when you
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
sentence you said if the allocation
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
would not sink below 4.9 million floor
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
set in 2021 yes so if
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
if this increase
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
let's say it's going to happen for a
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
short term and then it doesn't it's the
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
revenues go down
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
it would but any case matter how far
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
down they went it wouldn't go below the
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
4.9 million that's my intention yeah
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
but based on what uh chairwoman martin
 
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
told us she's expecting it to go up so
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions i have a question
 
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
if allowances go down by 118
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
725 allowances per year
 
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
if there are fewer allowances
 
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
won't the
 
02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know thank you very much mr chair
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
for this question
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't claim to be an expert on
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
this because obviously there are a lot
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
of moving parts here uh
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
it just
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
jolted my mind when i saw the letter
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
from chairman sherwood martin that she's
 
02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
predicting as much as a doubling of that
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
allowance price i don't know what that
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
is based on whether it is because we
 
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
have fewer allowances and the demand
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
goes up or whether other states
 
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
that are part of the system are driving
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
that price up without us i'm not exactly
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
sure in fact i see people here from the
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services who
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
probably could answer that better than i
 
02:55:26.399 --> 02:55:27.269 align:start position:0%
probably could answer that better than i
could

02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yes that's that's
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly true and we will ask them
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's one figure here one one thing
 
02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
you said that's troubling to me
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure i'm interpreting
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
it correctly
 
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
one was that there was 3.46 million
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
dollars given out and 3.5 million
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
administrative fee
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's called
 
02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
did i get that all wrong
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
oh 350 000 dollars
 
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
is is the administrative fee not 3.5
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
million no no no in the table here it
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
says current law
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
it lists less administrative
 
02:56:09.630 --> 02:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
0.35 million so 350 000 okay yeah
 
02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow up representative kelly pitts no
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:27.269 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative

1601
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
which would amend reggie revenue
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
distribution so that energy efficiency
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
programs are again prioritized as was
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
the original intention behind the
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
auction allowance system of the reggie
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
when it was first established
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
the decision to provide income from the
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
allowances as direct rebates to
 
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
customers was politically motivated not
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
a science-based decision

states

to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
not provide rebates to utility customers
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's high time to set aside partisan
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
interpretations of the importance of
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency measures and the
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
strategy of reduction of greenhouse

02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
the science of climate change and the
 
02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
impacts of climate change are no longer
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
debatable or theoretical
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
refusing to take action on low-hanging
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
fruit of energy efficiency measures is
 
02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
not only in bad faith to the original
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
intent of the reggie program
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
but is pennywise pound foolish in the
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
extreme and in my opinion the symptom of
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
a suicidal mentality a death wish that
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
has taken hold of a system that cannot
 
02:58:17.670 --> 02:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
even lift the merest finger of social
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
policy to save itself and a habitable
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
home for its descendants
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's no exaggeration to say that history
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
will not judge well of us
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
when we allow ideology to trump our
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
ability to engage in any sort of
 
02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
communal effort to cut
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary emissions of atmosphere

02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
as represented by the reggie program and

the distribution of allowances
 
02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
towards concrete steps to enhance energy
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our homes and businesses
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
anybody who thinks that it doesn't make
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
sense to spend money on energy
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency that's too costly or somehow
 
02:58:54.230 --> 02:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
not fair to anybody is not looking at
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the whole picture or looking at the
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
picture through the lens of an
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
antiquated and self-interested ideology
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
that lack of proper framing will cost
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
this dearly and when i say us
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
i include my children and grandchildren
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i take it personally
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the energy
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency measures carried out through
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire saves program
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
administered by the electric and natural
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
gas utilities
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
are a strong success story and an
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
integral part of our economy despite not
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of their chronic underfunding
 
02:59:26.550 --> 02:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
for every dollar invested over three
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
dollars of economic benefits are derived
 
02:59:31.750 --> 02:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
from 2018 to 2020 that translated into a
 
02:59:33.910 --> 02:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
net for the economy of more than half a
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and in the process
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
crucially to the mission i mentioned at
 
02:59:39.990 --> 02:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
the outset cut almost three and a half
 
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
million tons of carbon dioxide from the
 
02:59:44.309 --> 02:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
state's greenhouse gas emissions a
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
significant portion
 
02:59:47.429 --> 02:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
of the state's emissions in that
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
two-year period
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
so now is not the time to relax our
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
efforts as i said the need to continue
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
to cut carbon dioxide emissions is not
 
02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:57.190 align:start position:0%
to cut carbon dioxide emissions is not
debatable

02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
debatable
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire saves plays a crucial role
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
in building a sustainable 21st century
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
economy for new hampshire and reggie
 
03:00:05.110 --> 03:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
funds should be going where they are
 
03:00:07.110 --> 03:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
intended towards cutting emissions of
 
03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
not blanket subsidies for electric and
 
03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
natural gas customers
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
it's

03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that you couldn't testify in
 
03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
front of this committee
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
on and i will ask
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
mike fitzgerald from the new hampshire
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services if
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
he could make himself available to
 
03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee mike fitzgerald
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm the assistant director of the
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services air
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
resources division
 
03:00:55.830 --> 03:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
we administer the regis program in
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
coordination with the department of
 
03:00:57.359 --> 03:00:59.110 align:start position:0%
coordination with the department of
energy

03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:01:01.590 --> 03:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
we we manage the auctions
 
03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:02.710 align:start position:0%
we we manage the auctions
and

03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:04.389 --> 03:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
the revenue goes into the department of
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
energy where where it's dispersed
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
under rsa 125.0
 
03:01:12.389 --> 03:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
i know mr roberts is here from the
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy but
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think most of the questions that you
 
03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:16.469 align:start position:0%
i think most of the questions that you
have

03:01:16.469 --> 03:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
at this point relate to the
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
auction revenues and what might happen
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
here so we'll try to answer those and
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't know the answer we'll throw
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
mr roberts under the bus i mean uh defer
 
03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
mr roberts under the bus i mean uh defer
to

03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
defer to him but
 
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think we'll we'll we'll give it a shot
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i have with me also joe fontaine
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
who's the reggie program manager um he
 
03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
the person who is involved um on a
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis with conducting the
 
03:01:46.399 --> 03:01:48.550 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis with conducting the
auctions

03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
auctions
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
managing the
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue auction prices and all that
 
03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
the revenue auction prices and all that
so

03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
i may
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to have him
 
03:01:57.349 --> 03:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
assist me in responding to some of these
 
03:01:57.359 --> 03:01:59.110 align:start position:0%
assist me in responding to some of these
questions

03:01:59.110 --> 03:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:02:01.429 --> 03:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
i think the department takes no position
 
03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill by the way
 
03:02:06.150 --> 03:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh welcome back uh both
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
of you to the committee good to see you
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
both again thank you
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
we do have questions uh i'll recognize
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
first representative thomas for a
 
03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:14.389 align:start position:0%
first representative thomas for a
question

03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
my question and again welcome back as
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
well good to see you back here thank you
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh i want to refer back to a previous
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
comment made for some explanation for my
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
benefit and perhaps for the benefit of
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
one of our new members here on on the
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee could you explain to us um
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
what went into the
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i would call it a prediction
 
03:02:38.230 --> 03:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
that i think i heard that the auction
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
prices were thought to be going up and
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
could even be doubled but could you
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
explain that uh process or
 
03:02:48.150 --> 03:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
or or how that happens
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um i'm we're not familiar
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
specifically with the uh letter that is
 
03:02:56.309 --> 03:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
referred to from chairwoman martin um
 
03:02:59.429 --> 03:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh as mentioned previously for those of
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
you who aren't familiar
 
03:03:02.309 --> 03:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh before the department of energy was
 
03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
created the regi program was
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
administered jointly between the puc
 
03:03:09.429 --> 03:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and
 
03:03:09.439 --> 03:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and
the

03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
at that time chairwoman martin would
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
have been the reggie
 
03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
energy agency representative from new
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire commissioner scott of des
 
03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
would be the reggie environmental agency
 
03:03:27.910 --> 03:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
each state has two representatives
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
in in the uh
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
management of reggie
 
03:03:32.710 --> 03:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh chairwoman martin i'm not familiar
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
specifically with her comments but
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
prices auction revenues
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
joe and i were just talking it's a
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
market and market prices fluctuate
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
reggie auction prices have tended to
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
rise over the past several years as the
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
number of allowances has decreased
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
as you would expect
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
the allowances become more valuable
 
03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that and as representative samsuch
 
03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
and that and as representative samsuch
represented

03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
represented
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue total revenue is a function
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the total number of allowances that
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
are available
 
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
each year
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
times the revenue price there are four
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
quarterly auctions
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
so you would get four prices for
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh during the year of revenues
 
03:04:23.429 --> 03:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
joe the current revenue current auction
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
price is somewhere around 13
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
the last auction price was 13 yeah they
 
03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
have been as low as two at the beginning
 
03:04:32.790 --> 03:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the program um
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was when the dollar threshold was
 
03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:36.790 align:start position:0%
that was when the dollar threshold was
was

03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
established and for reference at that
 
03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
established and for reference at that
time

03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
that represented about 50 percent
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the dollar
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:51.670 --> 03:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
allowance prices were two dollars and
 
03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
the dollar threshold was one dollar so
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
one dollar went to
 
03:04:58.150 --> 03:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency programs and one
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
dollar went to um
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
rebates to to customers so
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
now that it's 13
 
03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
now that it's 13
we're

03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
at in in the under the current situation
 
03:05:11.590 --> 03:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
as the fiscal note describes
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically 12 of of revenue allowance
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
would go to assuming it stayed at 13 for
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
the full four years
 
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
full four quarters of a year
 
03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:24.150 align:start position:0%
full four quarters of a year
12

03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
12
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
of that revenue would be rebated and one
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
dollar would go into energy efficiency
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
programs under this bill that would be
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
revised in accordance with the
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
methodology that representative samsich
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
testified to
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you just a quick operational
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
note since neither of you have probably
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
worked with this new system we have here
 
03:05:44.550 --> 03:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
i was just going to suggest that you
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
joe if you want to speak mr fontaine if
 
03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
you want to speak move the microphone
 
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
great thank you yeah i was just going to
 
03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
add that um i'm not sure when the letter
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
from commissioner martin was written
 
03:05:55.760 --> 03:05:57.349 align:start position:0%
from commissioner martin was written
but

03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
the the revenues have already doubled so
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
a few years ago they were in the 16
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
17 million
 
03:06:07.830 --> 03:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
annual range
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
as in the
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
this past year there were 33 million so
 
03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:18.150 align:start position:0%
this past year there were 33 million so
um

03:06:18.150 --> 03:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:18.160 --> 03:06:19.750 align:start position:0%
um
i

03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:06:21.990 --> 03:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
like to quote past numbers i don't like
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
to speculate on what the market's going
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
to do in the future
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
so i i wouldn't be as bold to say that
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
past performance is not an indicator of
 
03:06:40.479 --> 03:06:42.630 align:start position:0%
past performance is not an indicator of
future

03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you if you'd like to be our
 
03:06:44.479 --> 03:06:48.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you if you'd like to be our
broker

03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to testify i'm just going
 
03:06:58.309 --> 03:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
to lay out a scenario and see if
 
03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
you could possibly see that as at least
 
03:07:01.359 --> 03:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
you could possibly see that as at least
possible

03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
right now isil new england is discussing
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
minimum offer price rule and having it
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
possibly go away
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
that could have the impact of collapsing
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
the capacity market prices and the
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
energy market prices as we get flooded
 
03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:16.070 align:start position:0%
energy market prices as we get flooded
with

03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
other resources more renewable
 
03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
and so uh it may drive some gen
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
fossil generators gas out of business
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
and so could you see the rigid prices
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
collapsing out of that unless there's a
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
pretty stiff price put on ancillary
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
again it's a market
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the market would respond to to
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
market forces which that would certainly
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
be one
 
03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:43.910 align:start position:0%
be one
um

03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that the
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
regi revenue is based on co2 emissions
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily market price not not
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
market uh
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
electricity prices
 
03:07:56.880 --> 03:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
electricity prices
so

03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know i mean if there were
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
companies out there that were supplying
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and they emitted co2 they
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
would still need to purchase a an
 
03:08:05.760 --> 03:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
would still need to purchase a an
allowance

03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
if those companies collapsed
 
03:08:12.309 --> 03:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know then and there were no market
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
there were no other revenues
 
03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
or no other market actors to to pick up
 
03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
those uh allowances then there certainly
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
could be a
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
a decline in in prices and perhaps a
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
precipitous one but
 
03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:28.389 align:start position:0%
precipitous one but
um

03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody has to generate
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
electricity and the demand for
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
electricity isn't going away and if
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're if it's from my fossil fuel
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
power plant that's 25 megawatts or
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
greater it's going to they're going to
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative samsuch it's not
 
03:08:45.279 --> 03:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
representative samsuch it's not
typically

03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
typically
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
allowed for
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of a bill to ask questions
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh during the bill's public hearing
 
03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
uh during the bill's public hearing
however

03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to allow it just this one time
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
just one question please
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
clarify something that joe just said
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
and also the fiscal note um because i
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
didn't write the fiscal note but when i
 
03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
look at the fiscal note i look at the 33
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
million that's listed here and i divide
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
that by the allowance amounts that are
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
listed in the fiscal note
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
i get a price of 9.53
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned the most recent
 
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
auctions were 13
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a shock or so but but
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
just points out that
 
03:09:35.429 --> 03:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
apparently there can be quite a swing in
 
03:09:35.439 --> 03:09:36.550 align:start position:0%
apparently there can be quite a swing in
prices

03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
prices
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct there were four auctions
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
03:09:42.230 --> 03:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
the first auction
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
was in the seven dollar range and then
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
the december auction was the thirteen
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
dollars okay so
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that range
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
is out to the nine goals
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and and again i think it's important to
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
remember that it's not just the price
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
per allowance but the number of
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
allowances so as that number of
 
03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
allowances so as that number of
allowances

03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
allowances
 
03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.269 align:start position:0%
allowances
decreases

03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
decreases
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
there'll be a
 
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative harrington thank you mr
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
question just just on that subject we
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
were just referring to there you would
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
mention that the price was much higher
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
in december than it was earlier in the
 
03:10:24.230 --> 03:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
year um i'm assuming that's to do with
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've been burning a lot
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
more oil in coal uh in this in well
 
03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
right now we're burning a lot more oil
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
and coal uh so going forward through
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
this winter was it was that the driving
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
no not so much
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
again i don't like to speculate but i
 
03:10:42.319 --> 03:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
again i don't like to speculate but i
will

03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
market

03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
activity in the natural gas market
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
occurred and those prices
 
03:10:58.469 --> 03:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
due to the european natural gas market
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
and exports to europe
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh went up significantly and so i think
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
they doubled
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
so the regime allowances
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes track
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
the natural gas price allowances
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the auctions you can have
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
the power plants the compliance entities
 
03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:18.950 align:start position:0%
the power plants the compliance entities
but

03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's also open to
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
investment firms
 
03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
investment firms
so

03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
someone can buy and retire the the
 
03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
things right
 
03:11:30.230 --> 03:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
well they
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're buying them to sell them at a
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
higher price later on that's what
 
03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
they're doing so okay thank you yeah
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
glasses on glasses off
 
03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
glasses on glasses off
uh

03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we're talking in money
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
and we suppose we should be talking in
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
percentages you mentioned that we were
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
at 50
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
when the program started
 
03:12:00.479 --> 03:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
when the program started
right

03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that allowance
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
prices at that time were right whatever
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
they were whether they were 10 cents or
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
10 000. so now we are looking to go up
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
to 15
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
is that
correct

03:12:15.750 --> 03:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we want to give 15
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the revenues whatever those revenues
 
03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
of the revenues whatever those revenues
are

03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
right is that my correct interpretation
 
03:12:32.469 --> 03:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
based based on
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at the fiscal note the
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is based on a revenue of 33
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
million for 2021. the revenue going
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
forward could be a different figure
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
right but i'm looking
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
so but based on the 2021
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers you just cited are correct
 
03:12:48.960 --> 03:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
the numbers you just cited are correct
but

03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
help me a little bit with this math is
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
not my big deal
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh if we
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
no matter what it is
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
it would be 15 of that number whether it
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
dips or rises
 
03:13:14.790 --> 03:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
but the floor would stay
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
would the floor stay
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure the floor i thought could
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
go no lower than 4.9 million
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what i thought it said in the
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
bill um so we can go up actually in the
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill um it refers to 2020
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that you might need a technical
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to make that 2021 if you want
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
the floor to be 4.9 million to keep the
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
floor steady 2020 it would be a lesser
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
amount than 4.9
 
03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
so

03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
at the way i'm thinking very
 
03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:56.469 align:start position:0%
at the way i'm thinking very
simplistically

03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
simplistically
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
is that 15
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
back to the reggie fund or back to
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency is not going to be
 
03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:07.349 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency is not going to be
catastrophic

03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.630 --> 03:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for how many years
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
since 2009
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that we've got you know that the 15
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
is not going to be
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
a big
 
03:14:22.319 --> 03:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
a big
major

03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
major
 
03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:25.110 align:start position:0%
major
problem

03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and would you would you concur with that
 
03:14:30.070 --> 03:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if you again referring to the
 
03:14:31.910 --> 03:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the change
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh based on the 2020 um
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
numbers that joe used
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 i'm sorry
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh the change would be under current law
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
it would be 3.46 million going into the
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency fund
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
under this proposed bill it would have
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
been 4.9 million so it would have
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
changed it from 3.46 to 4.9
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
may i
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
technically no
 
03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
you've already asked two questions but
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
i will follow up if if it's okay with
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
03:15:08.070 --> 03:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
the bill says
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill on lines
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
17 and 18 on um
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
well 17 and 18 of the bill
 
03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
well 17 and 18 of the bill
says

03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the fifth the allowance all amounts
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
in excess of 15 of the 2020 reggie
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
allowance revenue or 15 of the current
 
03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
allowance revenue or 15 of the current
year's

03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
year's
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
reggie allowance revenue whichever is
 
03:15:32.239 --> 03:15:33.429 align:start position:0%
reggie allowance revenue whichever is
higher

03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
shall be rebated
 
03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:38.630 align:start position:0%
shall be rebated
so

03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
the higher amount would always be
 
03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.510 align:start position:0%
the higher amount would always be
rebated

03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
rebated
 
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
rebated
15

03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
the amount in 2020 but it could actually
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
be less than 13 15
 
03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
in subsequent years it could go down
 
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i would i would agree with
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
your analysis i
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
i just pointed that
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
if the
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
revenue allowance were to were to
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
decline what what the 15
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
the initial 15 that refers to the 2020
 
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
that would actually act as a floor
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
so if if the revenues were to go below
 
03:16:14.800 --> 03:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
so if if the revenues were to go below
that

03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
in any given year
 
03:16:19.590 --> 03:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would that would be the floor and
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
if the intent was for the floor to be
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
the 4.9 it would be
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
you would need a technical amendment to
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
make that refer to 2021 instead of 2020.
 
03:16:33.030 --> 03:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
correct so the floor is actually 15 of
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
2020. as the bill is written now yes do
 
03:16:37.590 --> 03:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
we know what the the revenues were in
 
03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
we know what the the revenues were in
2020

03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
2020
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think that we did we were doing
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
some expected i think we said around 21
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
million joe
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back and provide that
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
number to you i don't have that with me
 
03:16:49.439 --> 03:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
number to you i don't have that with me
today

03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
i had the 2019 number
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
was uh 16.8 million i think so it's
 
03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
between 16.8 a little it's a little bit
 
03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
between 16.8 a little it's a little bit
higher

03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
um the allowance prices in 2020 were
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
were less than
 
03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:07.269 align:start position:0%
were less than
um

03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
what they were in 2021.
 
03:17:09.439 --> 03:17:10.229 align:start position:0%
what they were in 2021.
okay

03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly get back to you with
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
that figure
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
fine thank you any uh additional
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
03:17:21.030 --> 03:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
exemplary gentlemen from des
 
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairvoz um i just wanted to
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarify i know
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
one of the introductory pieces about
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
this is that reggie is a multi-state
 
03:17:32.319 --> 03:17:33.269 align:start position:0%
this is that reggie is a multi-state
effort

03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
effort
 
03:17:33.279 --> 03:17:34.469 align:start position:0%
effort
um

03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
can you just explain how other states
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
are handling this
 
03:17:42.070 --> 03:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
reggie funding and what's going on with
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
rebating or not how is that handled in
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
other states that are part of this
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
reggie collaborative
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
um one of
 
03:17:50.229 --> 03:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we'll provide to
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
following this uh we will send the
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee a link to the most recent
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
reggie annual report that outlines how
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
each state
 
03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:00.389 align:start position:0%
each state
um

03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:00.399 --> 03:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
um
delivers

03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
delivers
 
03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
delivers
um

03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
states differ many
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know there are currently joe what 11
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
states now
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
currently 11 states um it's subject to
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
individual policy in each state
 
03:18:14.399 --> 03:18:15.670 align:start position:0%
individual policy in each state
um

03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
is it probably about 60 50 60 percent
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
joe is is energy efficiency
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the total cumulative of the
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
cumulative proceeds uh
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:30.150 align:start position:0%
it's uh
54

03:18:30.150 --> 03:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
54
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
was the most recent number so that's
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
total for all
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
total for all states about 54 goes to
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
some some goes to rebates some goes to
 
03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:42.389 align:start position:0%
some some goes to rebates some goes to
other

03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
renewables some states
 
03:18:44.239 --> 03:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
renewables some states
yeah

03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for instance used it to
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
fund clean clean vehicles um rebates
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
so there's a wide variety and we'll send
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
you that link that that report outlines
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to do a comparison are there
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
any other states of these 11 that are
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
rebating everything but the first dollar
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
back to consumers
 
03:19:15.190 --> 03:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there are any
 
03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
states that
 
03:19:17.760 --> 03:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
states that
are

03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
at that level well
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
so they're higher
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
in in general to the best of my
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge yes okay thank you
 
03:19:31.030 --> 03:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
03:19:35.910 --> 03:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
what for what what purpose is the member
 
03:19:38.399 --> 03:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
what for what what purpose is the member
uh

03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:42.229 --> 03:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
rise thank you mr chairman i would just
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
want to request the gentleman from des
 
03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
if they could also provide us a copy of
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
the recent report on legislative
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
oversight for
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
electric services which
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
october 1st i think from craig wright
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of information relevant
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate you guys
 
03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
supplying that information and
 
03:20:06.870 --> 03:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate you both being here thank you
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you i do have one copy
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
of that report that mike was referring
 
03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's for the 2019 year uh on the
 
03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
proceeds with the appendix that has each
 
03:20:18.800 --> 03:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
proceeds with the appendix that has each
states

03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
spending i can i can if you could send
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
it along i'll make sure everybody else

gets a copy i have it with me oh you
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
have it with you okay thank you

we can send the link
 
03:20:31.590 --> 03:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the link would be better yeah link
 
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be better
 
03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be better
okay

03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
did you have

oh i'm sorry representative platt yes i
 
03:20:40.830 --> 03:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
just would appreciate the
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
results for 20 and 20 21 as well for
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
every auction
 
03:20:50.550 --> 03:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay now i guess we can uh move on and
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i will call on our next
 
03:21:00.309 --> 03:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
speaker who is
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
a gentleman who's rapidly becoming our
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
new best friend
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
griffin rhubar robarge verge from the
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:21:20.880 --> 03:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
again

03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
griffin roberts from the new hampshire
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
committee certainly asked a lot of
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
questions of des
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
i would consider them the best experts
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
for you today but i'll certainly
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that the
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
forget to turn on my mic anyone have any
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
questions for mr roberge
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
03:21:56.720 --> 03:21:57.750 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
chairman

03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
um welcome back thank you uh
 
03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
three days in i have a good one for you
 
03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
three days in i have a good one for you
yes

03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the question is does the
 
03:22:09.269 --> 03:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
department have
 
03:22:09.279 --> 03:22:10.469 align:start position:0%
department have
um

03:22:10.469 --> 03:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
have plans to pull together
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh their own plans for energy efficiency
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the state because i think as you've
 
03:22:20.710 --> 03:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
probably seen we have energy efficiency
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
coming at you in various forms of
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
legislation trying to figure out how do
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
we do it how do we fund it how do we
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
make it work no where's the right place
 
03:22:31.269 --> 03:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
so i know you're new but no i
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
first off thank you for the question uh
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative yes i know this bill as
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
well as the one that's going to be heard
 
03:22:37.990 --> 03:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
after which i believe
 
03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative mann i i believe uh is
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsoring that bill
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
um you know i think one of the more
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh talked about issues regarding energy
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
efficiency has been the puc's decision
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
on the energy efficiency resource
 
03:22:50.880 --> 03:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
on the energy efficiency resource
standard

03:22:51.990 --> 03:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
as i'm
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
sure that this committee is well aware
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative votes has house bill 549
 
03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:58.630 align:start position:0%
representative votes has house bill 549
which

03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
cleared with a unanimous vote i believe
 
03:23:03.510 --> 03:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
last week in house in the house
 
03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:05.670 align:start position:0%
last week in house in the house
343-0

03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
343-0
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
that bill i'm sure
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
will be heard by the senate
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
relevant senate committee sometime soon
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
the department is monitoring the course
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of that bill um
 
03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
of that bill um
obviously

03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
overseeing any potential changes there
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
coming up on that
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
so yes we're keeping a keen eye on that
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to follow up
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes that would be great
 
03:23:33.910 --> 03:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is um
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
does the department have any preference
 
03:23:39.269 --> 03:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:41.190 --> 03:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
oh in terms of energy efficiency funding
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
ends up in yeah because yeah we're
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
trying to go after it in multiple ways
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious whether the
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
department has anything no and that's
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
understandable i think the i think the
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
department at this time is just
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring the various legislative
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
proposals and is considering which one
 
03:23:56.309 --> 03:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
may be best to you know address the
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
objectives of energy efficiency in the
 
03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
state um i would just say you know at
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
this point at this time just because
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's so much focus on it and it is
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
explicitly focused on the energy
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency resource standard in the
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
pucc's decision i'd say you know we're
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
we're closely following house bill 549
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions for
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
mr roberge
 
03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you mr roberge for
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
your testimony and
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
oh there is one more
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the community okay
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
where did that come from

oh okay
 
03:24:38.830 --> 03:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
so now i'd like to call on brett

i'm just a citizen who is uh interested
in

03:25:06.229 --> 03:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
energy and uh
 
03:25:11.510 --> 03:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
i am uh currently the chairman of the
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
hillsborough energy commission
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
basically here to speak
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
towards the uh
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill which would
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
help to increase funding for the new
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves program new hampshire
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
saves is a program which
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh helps
 
03:25:31.760 --> 03:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh helps
uh

03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:33.910 align:start position:0%
uh
save

03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
save
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
energy it it the energy efficiency
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
program is
 
03:25:38.720 --> 03:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
program is
uh

03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:40.309 align:start position:0%
uh
the

03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:43.030 --> 03:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
easy way to
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
improve our energy system
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't need more generation
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to cut the amount of energy
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that is saved
 
03:25:54.550 --> 03:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
so you know i i'm not going to talk
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
about the the uh
 
03:25:56.960 --> 03:25:58.229 align:start position:0%
about the the uh
the

03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
numbers and all that i just
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
want to say that
 
03:26:02.319 --> 03:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
want to say that
um

03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
from my point of view
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know we are in a situation where we
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
need to
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
revamp our entire power generation
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
and this is a great program and uh the
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
increased funding would be beneficial
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so i'm in favor of it and i'm
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we appreciate you being
 
03:26:28.870 --> 03:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
here as someone who is a member of a
 
03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
town energy
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
organization you might be
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
an ideal person to ask some questions
 
03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
an ideal person to ask some questions
about

03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
what you see
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
day to day and on the ground

they rejected the triennium energy
 
03:27:01.439 --> 03:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
they rejected the triennium energy
plan

03:27:03.030 --> 03:27:03.040 align:start position:0%

utilities who administer new hampshire
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
saves ought to be trying to find more
 
03:27:16.710 --> 03:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
private funding non-ratepayer funding
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
to implement energy efficiency programs
 
03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
as somebody who's on the ground close to
 
03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%

you know of any way to any sources of
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
funding that could be tapped for that
 
03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:37.990 align:start position:0%
funding that could be tapped for that
process

03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:38.000 align:start position:0%

do some of these
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
weatherization products on the
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
very old and
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%

the reggie program were to increase
 
03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
the reggie program were to increase
funding

funding
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
is that something that your group would
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%

i would like your on the ground
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
perspective i have i attended my first
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the first uh
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
community power forum in my home
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
district of marlborough last night
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
i was pleased and happy to learn that
 
03:29:59.190 --> 03:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
well eight percent of the people who
 
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
answered a survey and of course these
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
surveys are always self-selecting
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh said they wanted to see a reduction
 
03:30:07.830 --> 03:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
in their um rates
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh the other 92 percent were either
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
neutral on that question or they would
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
be stated very clearly they'd be willing
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
to pay a slight amount more
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
if they knew the energy they were
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
purchasing would be of a green nature
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you find this kind of do you have
 
03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
access to any kind of this kind of
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
information in your hillsborough
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee and i was wondering if you
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
could tell us what those kind of figures
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
are there as far as what your
 
03:30:33.359 --> 03:30:35.269 align:start position:0%
are there as far as what your
um

03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:36.630 --> 03:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
what your committee supports and what
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
they see the people of hillsboro
 
03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:41.110 align:start position:0%
they see the people of hillsboro
sporting

03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.120 --> 03:30:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you we do not have a
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
whole lot of uh
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
input from the from the people in town
 
03:30:50.560 --> 03:30:51.429 align:start position:0%
input from the from the people in town
um

03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:51.439 --> 03:30:52.150 align:start position:0%
um
we're

03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
we have virtually no
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh public at our meetings and uh we're
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
just trying to get
 
03:30:59.359 --> 03:31:00.229 align:start position:0%
just trying to get
our

03:31:00.229 --> 03:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
job done which is to save money for the
 
03:31:02.640 --> 03:31:04.070 align:start position:0%
job done which is to save money for the
town

03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
we're currently uh not only doing the uh
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
energy audit and upgrades to the town
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
buildings but we're also doing a led
 
03:31:14.800 --> 03:31:16.389 align:start position:0%
buildings but we're also doing a led
light

03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
light
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
street light replacement project and you
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
know these are the things that we're
 
03:31:23.190 --> 03:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on things that actually
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
will save the town money
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be saving the town
 
03:31:28.239 --> 03:31:30.469 align:start position:0%
we're going to be saving the town
uh

03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's around
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
40 000 a year once the led lights are
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
replaced and so
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much our focus is um
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
saving energy and by such saving
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers money
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
i should add those numbers came about
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
because we did we are looking into uh
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
moving into community power and if
 
03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're not at that point yet it's
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly understandable go follow up

03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
the committee at some point
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%

active energy commission for a long time
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
and they did an energy audit years ago
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
based on some software that came out of
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
epa i was just curious how you
 
03:32:24.389 --> 03:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish the audit because usually
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's where you make the decisions of
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
where you're going to put the money in
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
in your efforts
 
03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%

be a name some of you might know if
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%

improved their reduce the consumption of
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
heating oil by 58
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%

funds um
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
i presented the project after doing a
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
few things with um you know programmable
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
thermostat and so on
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%

to do this job
um

03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:46:57.189 --> 03:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know i have as i said i've had some
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
experience and on for most of our
 
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
buildings in town including our school
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
we've been audited and we know exactly
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
what the situation is in all of these
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what energy efficiency
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
programs do
 
03:47:08.399 --> 03:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
programs do
typically

03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
typically
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
with my daughter's house in
 
03:47:11.359 --> 03:47:13.429 align:start position:0%
with my daughter's house in
massachusetts

03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
they blew insulation into the walls from
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
the outside shingle house they just
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
drill a hole
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
put in a pipe and this uh cellulose just
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
blasts up into the whole
 
03:47:24.479 --> 03:47:25.349 align:start position:0%
blasts up into the whole
um

03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:25.359 --> 03:47:26.229 align:start position:0%
um
column

03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
column
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
between the two two by fours that are
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically uh what's 18 inches 24 inches
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
apart you just go down the house and
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
blow the walls full of insulation
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
which is the only since everything is
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
all sealed you need to have a funny way
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
like that and my wife's
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
house in somerville they went inside
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
because it had asbestos shingles like
 
03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
typical manchester house
 
03:47:49.199 --> 03:47:50.070 align:start position:0%
typical manchester house
and

03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
went inside drilled and then patched the
 
03:47:52.160 --> 03:47:53.750 align:start position:0%
went inside drilled and then patched the
holes

03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
holes
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
were done in eight hours and it was a
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
big grand
 
03:48:01.600 --> 03:48:02.710 align:start position:0%
big grand
house

03:48:02.710 --> 03:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
so you know amer energy efficiency is a
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing thing
 
03:48:06.720 --> 03:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing thing
um

03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
i was in i've always been interested in
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
this so i attended a house hearing
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh soon after reggie was started up we
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
were joining reggie
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing for a bill to get us
 
03:48:26.469 --> 03:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
out of reggie
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
and a gentleman who
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
identified himself as corey lewandowski
 
03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
state director for americans for
 
03:48:34.319 --> 03:48:36.150 align:start position:0%
state director for americans for
prosperity

03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
prosperity
 
03:48:36.160 --> 03:48:37.269 align:start position:0%
prosperity
um

03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
was sitting in the front
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
very close to the
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of testimony against
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
the bill from people in the public
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
and after a while the chairman looked
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
down at lewandowski and said
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
we'll never pass this bill to kill
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
reggie we'll go with a rebate and he was
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
nodding his head as if to say you know
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
this is the decision your
 
03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:08.469 align:start position:0%
this is the decision your
your

03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
your hopes are all gone so anyway
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
that was the end of that the um the
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
meeting kind of erupted in uh uproar and
 
03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:17.990 align:start position:0%
meeting kind of erupted in uh uproar and
uh

03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
was uh conveniently recessed until
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
around six at night so
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
that cleared up that problem so it was a
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
very very clever maneuver
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
by one of our legislative heroes um
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
to save the day but what it turned out
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be is a compromise was had been made
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
with lewandowski
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
again in representing americans for
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
prosperity that we would stay in reggie
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
but we'd have this one dollar
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
would be kept in the energy efficiency
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
fund to do energy efficiency and all the
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
rest would be retained rebated to
 
03:49:53.279 --> 03:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
rest would be retained rebated to
ratepayers

03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the origin of this
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
whole situation that we're in
 
03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
whole situation that we're in
okay

03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:08.469 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
turns out um
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
maybe years later two or three four
 
03:50:13.910 --> 03:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
years later
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for one of the utilities was
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
at a
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee a meeting of this committee
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
and he showed me
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the typical rebate
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
despite all the money that we've been
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about about in this last
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
the last bill the typical rebate is
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
about a dollar a month
 
03:50:37.439 --> 03:50:38.469 align:start position:0%
about a dollar a month
another

03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh for somebody from new england new
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire electric cooperative
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
showed me a 65 cents
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
a month it was a rebate so the rebate is
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh it takes a lot of money away without
 
03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh it takes a lot of money away without
providing

03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
providing
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
any meaningful benefit
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the ratepayer
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
unless of course you're in the business
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
community and you're running a factory
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that
 
03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:05.030 align:start position:0%
so that's that
problem

03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
problem
um

03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
it turns out again if you
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
buy an led
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
or you're given an led
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
and you install it you're going to save
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of money every month
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
on your electric bill
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
because they save an awful lot of
 
03:51:26.319 --> 03:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
because they save an awful lot of
electricity

03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
now you can
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
keep that led
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
in maybe
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
two months three months four months
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
i think maybe in about one month a month
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
and a half you will have paid the price
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
of that led
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you can now buy a second one
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
and then now you have two led bulbs and
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
in half that time
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
you can buy a third
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
and in a third of that original time you
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
can buy a fourth
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
so without out without advancing any
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
money at all
 
03:52:01.279 --> 03:52:02.550 align:start position:0%
money at all
anyone

03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
given a single led
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
can save and
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
buy his way to to a complete replacement
 
03:52:12.070 --> 03:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
of all the lamps in his house with led
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
and save any amount of rebate
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
that he might have been getting so
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't feel sad for the individual
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
homeowner that might be losing a rebate
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
on his electric bill
 
03:52:26.479 --> 03:52:28.229 align:start position:0%
on his electric bill
um

03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:28.239 --> 03:52:31.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
then i
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i was discussing um
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative samsich's bill
 
03:52:39.040 --> 03:52:40.550 align:start position:0%
representative samsich's bill
and

03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
it just seemed too complicated for me so
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
i just decided the way to solve it is
 
03:52:46.080 --> 03:52:47.750 align:start position:0%
i just decided the way to solve it is
this

03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
every year for the next eight years or i
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't know six years we'll reduce the
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
rebate by a dollar
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
now i think that'll zero it out but for
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
some people it won't maybe for industry
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
it won't
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
but then the next month reduce it by
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
another dollar so a dollar a month until
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think 2028 is the way i ended it and
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's a simple-minded
 
03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:13.590 align:start position:0%
that's a simple-minded
um

03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
way of getting rid of the rebate without
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
having to know anything about the rebate
 
03:53:25.910 --> 03:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's basically what the bill does
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative mann for presenting this
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill to us i have one quick question
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
on line three of the bill it says for
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
since we're already in fiscal year 2022
 
03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:51.830 align:start position:0%
since we're already in fiscal year 2022
would

03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:53:54.150 --> 03:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
you be planning to file an amendment to
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
change that language to for fiscal year
 
03:53:56.399 --> 03:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
change that language to for fiscal year
2022

03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
2022
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
all amounts in excess
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah sure and that's changing
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
the language on line five to beginning
 
03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2022 is what it says now
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
change that to 2023. yes you would be
 
03:54:13.590 --> 03:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
open to that okay yeah i guess i don't
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
know when i wrote this bill maybe it was
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
sometime last year
 
03:54:21.429 --> 03:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
all right uh i'm getting old as you know
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
yes yes we understand so are we all and
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's preferable to the alternative right
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
so representative samsit should you have
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative man for taking my
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
question uh i just wanted to clarify you
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
just mentioned something about reducing
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
the rebate back to the ratepayers by a
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
dollar a month i think you meant per
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
year right
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
not every month every month because in
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
your bill here it says decreasing
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
by one year starting
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2022
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year 227 the rebat amount
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
all retail elect this is line six shall
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but you just said per month
 
03:55:08.239 --> 03:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
yeah but you just said per month
um

03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
the better way to put it would be the
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
monthly rebate
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
the monthly rebate so i'll insert
 
03:55:18.479 --> 03:55:22.389 align:start position:0%
the monthly rebate so i'll insert
monthly

03:55:22.389 --> 03:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
so all retail electric rate payers shall
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:55:35.349 --> 03:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
so in other words it just drops
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
dollar and then it's a dollar less
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
but not every month right that's what
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm asking no it's just the monthly
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
rebate oh the monthly rebate amount
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
will be decreased annually by a dollar
 
03:55:51.910 --> 03:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
just you need to follow it
 
03:55:54.239 --> 03:55:55.189 align:start position:0%
just you need to follow it
okay

03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
um representative callie pitts
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
john help me
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
so if the
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
if the rebate is a dollar
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
or 65 cents
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
it would go to zero immediately
 
03:56:09.680 --> 03:56:10.630 align:start position:0%
it would go to zero immediately
yes

03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:12.550 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
no the rate payer won't have to pay
 
03:56:17.189 --> 03:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
no i'm kidding
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:56:25.439 --> 03:56:26.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:27.349 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:29.590 --> 03:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
bolded letters here we just went through
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
changing some of the years
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
and it appears that you're looking to do
 
03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
this over a five-year period ending in
 
03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
2027 based on that bolded language if we
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
change 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
would you also want to be changing 2027
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
to 2028 yes
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
why not yay okay got that out clearly
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.030 --> 03:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any more questions for
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
before we move on oh representative
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
samsic sorry uh sorry uh i i just wanted
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
now that we're changing the dates
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
on line seven it says beginning in
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2028 the rebate amount shall
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
be set to zero
 
03:57:17.439 --> 03:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
be set to zero
but

03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts just asked
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
you about that and it seems like it's
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to be zero in a year
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
well 20 28. well that that's that
 
03:57:29.189 --> 03:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
depends if the
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the utility agent uh representative from
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
several years ago putting up you know a
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
dollar is the typical rebate that could
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
change the allowances could go up
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
right the the cost of an allowance goes
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
up and i don't understand how that works
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
but um i just thought
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know if it
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
you've got fair warning that it's going
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
to be zero
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it gradually gets down there and i
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
think that's fine and i'm and i'm just
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
throwing a dart at the wall frankly
 
03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:05.030 align:start position:0%
throwing a dart at the wall frankly
so

03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
this language won't work because the way
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
the program currently works
 
03:58:18.150 --> 03:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
is all the money in excess of a dollar
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
gets rebated to customers so for example
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
right if if the number is 13
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
as it was in the december auction
 
03:58:27.520 --> 03:58:28.950 align:start position:0%
as it was in the december auction
uh

03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
then the first
 
03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
dollar would go back to energy
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs but the next 12
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
would go back to rate payers right
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
so decreasing this by one dollar a year
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
for five years
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
if it happens to be
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
twelve dollars
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to get you to where you want
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
to go so that's right i think maybe you
 
03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
need to re will that rethink this well
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
the um i thought of that i
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's basically says in base in beginning
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll say 9
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
the rebate amount shall be set to zero
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
and i guess i should put
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i said beginning in i should say
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
that it would continue at that level
 
03:59:12.560 --> 03:59:14.469 align:start position:0%
that it would continue at that level
zero

03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
zero
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think and i think again energy
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency is so
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
damned important
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
and uh house the
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the value of the house my
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
wife bought
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
people saying oh yeah we know it's
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
energy efficient you know it's one other
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:36.150 --> 03:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee did you have a
 
03:59:36.160 --> 03:59:38.150 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee did you have a
question

03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:59:38.160 --> 03:59:41.189 align:start position:0%
question

name is griffin roberge from the new
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of energy
 
04:00:34.830 --> 04:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
um house bill 1621 fn
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
much like the previous bill
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
amends the type of the level of rebate
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's rebated back to
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rate payers under the
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%

04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
initiative program um
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly open to take any questions
 
04:01:00.150 --> 04:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
if the committee has any
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
i would certainly defer any more
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
technical questions to
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
the expertise of mike fitzgerald and joe
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay questions for mr roberge
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
sorry the numbers of the committee have
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
dwindled a little bit we've we've had
 
04:01:24.389 --> 04:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
because there was not a lot of advance
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
notice for this meeting people had other
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
appointments and
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
things scheduled so if anybody has any
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%

you'll have my email phone number thank
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
by the way i neglected to mention that

uh mr chairman
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
did you representative partial you have
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
a question that's basic housekeeping um
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
mr roberts can we expect to see you at
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
generally every one of our upcoming
 
04:02:24.720 --> 04:02:26.710 align:start position:0%

sessions
 
04:02:28.469 --> 04:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of this committee meeting i i
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't comment whether or not that'll be
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
something on an ongoing basis uh that's
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
my operating assumption right now um but
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
i can't give you a definitive answer on
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
that just yet well i always hope you
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
feel welcome i just wonder if this is
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
what a format you should be expecting
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%

04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none it looks like mr roberge is
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
the last person to testify on this bill
 
04:03:05.920 --> 04:03:07.030 align:start position:0%

chairvoz i just have a housekeeping
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
question um previously we had a room off
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
of our hearing
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
space where we could store bills are we
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
doing that with this office or is there
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
another space that's assigned to us
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
down the hall
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
good good question and my apologies for
 
04:03:48.800 --> 04:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
good good question and my apologies for
not

04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue earlier
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
our office is still 304 that has not
 
04:03:56.560 --> 04:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
our office is still 304 that has not
changed

04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
the file cabinets and the file drawers
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
in 304 are still ours
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
so if you want to put your stuff there
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's where you can put it we will
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
continue to meet in this room for the
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
but that room remains hours and
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
presumably at some point we'll be
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
returning to room 302 304
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%

bi-weekly or
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
