00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 align:start position:0%
presenters at 11 30 you have Department
 
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology coming in
 
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
their their role or charge is twofold
 
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
today with you
 
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
first they're going to come in and talk
 
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
to you about
 
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
um for those capital projects that are
 
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
I.T related
 
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
the department of Information Technology
 
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
is involved with those that's often a
 
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
question this committee has when there
 
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
are projects included in the capital
 
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
budget you know if there's been some
 
00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
review of the need and some process to
 
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
determine you know it's just the
 
00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
appropriate project to move forward
 
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
and then the second is at one o'clock
 
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
you have the department of
 
00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
administrative Services coming in the
 
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services is
 
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 align:start position:0%
responsible for the majority of the
 
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
state buildings that you see around
 
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
um here in Concord up at hospital
 
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
grounds Hazen drive this uh State House
 
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
Annex buildings
 
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
what they do in terms of managing those
 
00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
buildings but also the the director of
 
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
Public Works will be here and he'll talk
 
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 align:start position:0%
to you about what they do in terms of
 
00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
looking at the state agency's request
 
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
for capital projects and how they go
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
about basically creating this blue book
 
00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
from this big binder so I just wanted to
 
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
point that out before I got started with
 
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
so if you can go to the orientation
 
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.929 align:start position:0%
so if you can go to the orientation
document

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be just a um a One-Stop
 
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
shop for the committee members to find
 
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
different elements of the capital budget
 
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
things such as the statutes ways that we
 
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 align:start position:0%
track projects
 
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
requests that were made and so I think
 
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
the most important page is that flip the
 
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
cover page and it's the contact
 
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.390 align:start position:0%
cover page and it's the contact
information

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
or you need additional information about
 
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
anything that we're looking at in terms
 
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
of the capital budget please feel free
 
00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
to reach out to me you can call me send
 
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
me an email and and I will get back to
 
00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.330 align:start position:0%
me an email and and I will get back to
you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
there's a website there so all the
 
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
documents that you're going to see in
 
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
front of this committee except for this
 
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
binder and this blue book will be
 
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
available electronically
 
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
and it's you can find it at that web web
 
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
link right there
 
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
hmm as I go along if anybody has
 
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
questions just stop me I'm not going to
 
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
go every single page of this document we
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
will skip through it
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
so the pages one through five are just
 
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
the statutes related to the capital
 
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
budget and why
 
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
um you have a house bill 25 essentially
 
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
so I won't go through that with you but
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
really on page six just to kind of give
 
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
you an overview of the capital budget
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
process this is a process that starts
 
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
back in March April time frame the
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
agencies start considering what capital
 
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
projects they'd like to pursue
 
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
and by May 1st they need to provide
 
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
with their request for capital projects
 
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's what this large binder is it's
 
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
all their requests
 
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
by June 30th
 
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
of last year the governor had to have
 
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
hearings on the capital budget
 
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
so this process has already started so
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
so there's some some of these pieces of
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
information may be a little dated
 
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
so from the governor's capital budget
 
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
hearings certain projects are chosen by
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
the governor and his team to further
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
investigate or review to determine what
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
it might cost to move it forward
 
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
that becomes this Blue Book
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
so again it takes everything that's in
 
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
this big binder
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
that the agencies have submitted and
 
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 align:start position:0%
then the governor and his team along
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
with Public Works will pick a number of
 
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
projects that they want to investigate a
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
little bit further in terms of the cost
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
and the need and then they produce this
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
book by December
 
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
then the governor by February 15th
 
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
proposes his operating budget and his
 
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 align:start position:0%
capital budget so you saw that a couple
 
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and everybody got the blue
 
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
book excuse me the green book
 
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
um where that the governor is
 
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
recommending what he would like to see
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
for capital projects
 
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.690 align:start position:0%
for capital projects
um

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
by the time the legislature is done
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the committee has to agree
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
with them it just gives you a starting
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
point you're going to hear from agencies
 
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
that are going to tell you that there's
 
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
a projects they may not have been
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
included by the governor that they'd
 
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
um there may be projects that are
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
included that agencies come in and say
 
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
never mind we don't want to do that one
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
for some reason or another
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
so this process over the next couple of
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
weeks you'll be hearing a lot from the
 
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.370 align:start position:0%
weeks you'll be hearing a lot from the
agencies

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
once you get done with the capital
 
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.070 align:start position:0%
once you get done with the capital
budget

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
it'll cross over to the Senate the
 
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
Senate will go through a similar process
 
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
and they'll add and delete make changes
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
as they feel that they would like and
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
once they're done they'll pass it and
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
they'll come back over to the house and
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
the house will decide whether you want
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
to take it to a committee a conference
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
if you decide you want to do a committee
 
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
a conference then you would let the
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
Senate know the Senate would concur or
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
not Concur and at that point the chair
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the house committee because it's a
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
house bill would then be responsible for
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
setting up the committee conference and
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
the meeting dates and times and running
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
that meeting
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
once there's agreement
 
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's agreement
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
the committee a conference report would
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
come back to the full legislature we
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
would get a thumbs up or thumbs down
 
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
vote assuming it gets a thumbs up vote
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
it would go to the governor for
 
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 align:start position:0%
signature for non-signature or for a
 
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.490 align:start position:0%
signature for non-signature or for a
veto

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
veto
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
challenges for the chair of uh of Public
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
Works is to try to get
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
um the capital budget out
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
with just a Voice vote without minimal
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
debate if any
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think over the last few years
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
you've seen that and that's because the
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee works pretty well with each
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
other to determine what the I think I'll
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
use Representative mcconkey's term
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's essentially the process
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
you'll go through
 
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
if you look on pages seven and eight
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's just the docket for House Bill 25
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
just to kind of show you the dates of
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
when things are occurring and what's
 
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
when things are occurring and what's
happening

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
if you go to page
 
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.529 align:start position:0%
if you go to page
9

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
9
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a through columns a
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
through F you'll see Governor house
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
senate and then there'll be a difference
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
column between the Senate and the house
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
so during this process
 
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 align:start position:0%
I will be tracking all your decisions
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
and keeping a document similar to this
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
that would just have the governor and
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
house columns in a difference column and
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
providing that to the committee members
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
as you're starting to make decisions
 
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
just to help you keep track of where
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
you're at with the capital budget but
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
everything this is the capital budget
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
from 21 so every project that was listed
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
is found under column A and then changes
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that were done
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
things that were Deleted things that
 
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
were added throughout the process
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then when you get if you flip to
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
page 15
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see rows 218 through 223
 
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 align:start position:0%
that provides you with the capital
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are being allowed
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
and you can see on row 220
 
00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
and you can see on row 220
um

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
the the capital appropriation that was
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to be generally funded bonds is
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
about 127.5 million dollars
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
Highway funds was just under 16 million
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
dollars and then other funds
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
was 16.3 million dollars other funds
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
would be things like The Liquor
 
00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:58.099 align:start position:0%
Commission the Lottery Commission
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
or if an agency has uh
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund that they're going to
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
use towards a capital project or part of
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
a capital project you would see that as
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry too too much
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
about that because I'll help keep you
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
straight on that
 
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.830 align:start position:0%
straight on that
um

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
as part of this package I've also
 
00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419 align:start position:0%
included the capital budget from 2021
 
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
so this would be the 22 20
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
1 excuse me 22 23 Capital Appropriations
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
so you'll have that if you want to flip
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
through that as you're going through
 
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.870 align:start position:0%
through that as you're going through
this

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.130 align:start position:0%
this
uh

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
this Cycles a recommendation for
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
projects you can see what was a approved
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to see it when you look at
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the capital budget looking you know it's
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
just on pages 17 through
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
22 it's basically a listing of all the
 
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.750 align:start position:0%
22 it's basically a listing of all the
projects

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
and amounts and then sources of funds
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
are included there once you move off
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
into page 23
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of narrative
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
some of this narrative is just what we
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
would call can language you know if the
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
university system is getting some money
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's some can language that's
 
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
there's some can language that's
included

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
included
um

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
about their Appropriations
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
you'll also see if there's um
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
a request to amend a prior capital
 
00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.269 align:start position:0%
a request to amend a prior capital
budget

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
if you would if you were to approve that
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
we would include it as a section in
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 25.
 
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
house bill 25.
um

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah there's not one in not one right
 
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
yeah there's not one in not one right
here

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you do in this
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
section is that
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the what we call the
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
lapse extension so agencies will request
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
as part of the capital budget to extend
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations from prior Capital
 
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations from prior Capital
budgets

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
um typically this committee has a
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that will look at all the
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions and if for those
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
projects that aren't extended we'll see
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
if there's any balances left in those
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that could possibly be
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
repurposed for projects that you might
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
be interested in funding
 
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.750 align:start position:0%
be interested in funding
um

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
I think the one cautionary note is in
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
Prior years you have seen this
 
00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
Prior years you have seen this
repurposing

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
repurposing
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
um be for you know million plus dollars
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
that could be used I think we've gone
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
through and grabbed the low hanging
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
fruit so to speak as well as with covid
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
and then the slow uptick once covid was
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
kind of going away and projects started
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
to move again getting supplies and
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
materials and people to do projects um
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
some of these Capital Appropriations
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
haven't been spent so you're not going
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
to be closing out as many projects as
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
you have in the past so that may impact
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
your ability to find these additional
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
I talk about the lapse extensions if you
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.829 align:start position:0%
go to
um

00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
page 28 that starts it's it's
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
Row three and that goes to the end of
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and the last capital
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
budget there were
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
so basically there was 185 projects on
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
they all come from a variety of years
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
many for are for the more recent Capital
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
budgets but there are some that are
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
older out there
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
um that agencies have requested to
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
continue to have the ability to use
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned there will be a
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that will look at that in
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
this group
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
we'll have agencies come in I'll be
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
working with agencies that only have a
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
couple that get memos or letters from
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
them to confirm why they need the lapse
 
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.430 align:start position:0%
them to confirm why they need the lapse
extension

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
we'll also make sure if an agency
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um failed to get a lapse extension put
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
into the capital budget that they let
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
this committee know so they can be added
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
so that they don't lose the ability to
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
spend the money that they're trying to
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:24.290 align:start position:0%
 
.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
what you have there is the summary of
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
the all the requests that were made as
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
part of this big notebook
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
by agency and then if you flip 41
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
through the end that's by each agency
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
you can see each project that they were
 
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.610 align:start position:0%
you can see each project that they were
requesting

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
and how much they thought it would cost
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
at the time they made this request so
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
again these were the requests that were
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
made back in June to the governor
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
this binder will be in represent
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
mcconkey's office he'll have this
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
available if people would like to look
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
at it or need to look at it
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
agencies when they come before you have
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
been instructed to use the governor's
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
capital budget recommended capital
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
budget when they present to you
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
so that should be the base
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
um focus for for any of the
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
presentations and from that the agencies
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
will raise questions
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
um or make requests of the committee for
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
things that they didn't have included or
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
if they need changes uh to whatever
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin yes on uh you've
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
got General Federal and Highway I
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand what temperature is what is
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
above so other funds would be
 
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
above so other funds would be
um

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
funds that are dedicated for a certain
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
purpose such as sweepstakes or lottery
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
or liquor
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
funds would be considered other funds in
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
this document dedicated funds that are
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
go to a specific agency so if there's a
 
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
go to a specific agency so if there's a
uh

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
just trying to think of a dedicated fund
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
off the
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
um police standards and training fund if
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
they were to use that for a capital
 
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.889 align:start position:0%
they were to use that for a capital
project

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:11.899 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
that would be the other funds so it
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
when the agency comes in they would
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
identify what that fund was that they
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
were using you typically
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
um the major ones you're going to see
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
are if liquor or Lottery come in
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
um fishing game
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
because they have some dedicated funds
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
or have a dedicated fund which is Fish
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
and Game fund but they also have other
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
funds that they can sometimes access
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
those are the typical ones you'll see
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else at this time
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
so if if you could just grab the um
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget and I'll just
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
kind of walk you through that just to
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
you flip to page one it's going to be
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see it you know it's
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
an alphabetical order
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
starts with administrative services and
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
ends with the veterans home
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
it gives you a total funds and then by
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
fund types and
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
under section one there's 173 million
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
dollars total funds being requested
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
of that it's 120 million a general funds
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
16 million of other funds
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
which to note its Liquor Commission is
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
the 16.4 millions of other funds in this
 
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
the 16.4 millions of other funds in this
document

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
and then 36 million dollars in in
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
the way it works with the bonding the
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
federal funds aren't bonded that's a
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
cash it's a match or or it's going to be
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
part of the project what's bonded would
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
be the general funds other funds and
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Highway funds and what the treasurer
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
does is she goes out and bonds for a
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
number we'll just say 60 million dollars
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
in a particular year
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
and from that the treasure would know
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
that 5 million is related to a highway
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
fund Bond 2 million is related to a
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
other funds the rest is General funds
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and they would charge the home fund
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the page one
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire 17
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation I just want
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
the committee to remind the committee
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriation that was made
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
in the 2019 capital budget
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
so in that budget they there were three
 
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
Appropriations made to the university
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
system one for that year one that's in
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
the 2223 capital budget and then this
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question thank you
 
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.269 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question thank you
um

00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure at the county level we're
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
going through the the budget system and
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
we have arpa funds that are available
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
for us to use and I was just curious if
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
at a state level there's also arpa funds
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that are available and if so did this
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
budget reflect
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
like especially like through I.T stuff
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
where it's a one-time purchase
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
something it's already been addressed
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
through arpa or is is used in a
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
different direction
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
so the arpa funds come through the
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office special office called
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
gopher governor's office
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
something something
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
there is no arpa funds in this capital
 
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:47.660 align:start position:0%
budget that you see before you
 
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.370 align:start position:0%
budget that you see before you
their

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
have been arpa funds appropriated
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee so they
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
come through the fiscal committee on an
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
accept and expend basis under RSA 1430
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
and there are some projects that would
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
be considered capital projects that are
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
being funded through arpa and and there
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
are some I.T projects that are
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
specifically being funded through arpa
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
but it is not being included in the
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
capital budget nor directly into the
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
there may be some
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
in some bills you may see Appropriations
 
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.950 align:start position:0%
in some bills you may see Appropriations
that

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.730 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
direct that if arpa funds are available
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
use those and then if they're not
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
available find other federal funds and
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
if those aren't available use General
 
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:36.860 align:start position:0%
funds but those are specific
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
bills that have been introduced with
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
that language
 
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.870 align:start position:0%
that language
so

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
this is good yeah
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes the follow-up on
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is there a list of
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
Opera funds that may have been spent for
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
things that were used for capital
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
projects that had previously been in
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
here in other words their duplication of
 
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.169 align:start position:0%
here in other words their duplication of
numbers

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
no there shouldn't be duplication of
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
numbers so there shouldn't be a project
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
in here that is funded elsewhere but is
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
that the question these projects are
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
Standalone and these are the first
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
funding that they're looking for
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um there is if you go to the Gopher
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
website they do have a um a document on
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
there that shows you how much of the
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
arpa funds have been
 
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.350 align:start position:0%
arpa funds have been
um

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:35.299 align:start position:0%
appropriated or or assigned
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
and as you scroll through that document
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
it will show you they group them you
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
know is it for travel and tourism is it
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
for water projects is it for
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
um IT projects is it for
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it might be so they
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
group it and then it also assigns what
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee item was if you
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
needed more details so you could find
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
that through the fiscal committee and
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
so again the the governor's recommended
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to look something like what
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
you'll get when House Bill 25 is
 
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.289 align:start position:0%
you'll get when House Bill 25 is
available

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
so again that's why we we've instructed
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the agencies to use this we're hoping
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you'll get House Bill 25 possibly
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
by the end of next week
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
and then if you turn to page six of this
 
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.909 align:start position:0%
and then if you turn to page six of this
document

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a variety of pieces
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
of language some of it I talked about
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
being the can language there's the
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
Authority for the Appropriations and
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
then starting on page seven are all the
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
laps lapse extensions that are going to
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
again House Bill 25 when you receive it
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
will look very similar they'll be a
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
little bit structurally different but
 
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
insert any other questions did I create
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
I don't have much more than that I think
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
um Lottery is here
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
um they're due at 10 30 so we've got six
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
minutes but sure I think we'll uh oh I'm
 
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
minutes but sure I think we'll uh oh I'm
sorry

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's okay Mr chairman thank you Chris
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
thanks for the presentation I appreciate
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
it I want to Circle back to lapse
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
extensions because
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
I know that this is like the beginning
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
of my second term but I've
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
on the municipal level we've never used
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions on the municipal I just
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
what what causes a lap extension to
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
occur are you just just kind of a newbie
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
kind of question so
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm an agency that was received a
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
we put it out to bid
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
first we figured out who we could send
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
it out you know what the bidding process
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be we put it out the bid we made
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
the decision
um

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
project gets delayed because the bids
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
that came back didn't fit what we
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
thought was going to be the cost there
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
we maybe need to go back and rework that
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
so by the time we get the project
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
reworked and rebid it's now spring
 
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
reworked and rebid it's now spring
of

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
May of this year
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
and if you don't get the project lapse
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
extension your authority to spend that
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
money goes away June 30 2023.
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the reason that they use it in the
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
capital budget in this way is that it
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
allows everybody to be aware of what's
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
being requested to go forward and this
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
committee takes an opportunity to have
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
the agencies to explain what's the
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
status of this project what's happening
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
why is there delays
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
when do you think you're going to get it
 
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.730 align:start position:0%
when do you think you're going to get it
done

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
are you ever going to get it done should
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
we consider maybe not doing that project
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
so so that it's a way to force the
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
project to be looked at one more time
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
instead of just giving them an open
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
appropriation that doesn't expire or
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
lapse they have to come back after every
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
two years and ask for a lapse extension
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
and then it makes you allows you to to
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
view it again and make sure that it's
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
heading in the direction that the
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
committee thought it was going to head
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
in okay good deal thank you I appreciate
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um Bruce can you explain if if the money
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
is no longer needed for a project or
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's excess money left over how do
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
that fits into this process can we
 
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.330 align:start position:0%
 
energy

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
so if you go back to page 25 of the um
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
the document
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
10 section 107 colon 12 lapse of Prior
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
Capital Bud uh Capital balance Highway
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
funds Capital Appropriations for the
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety you'll see under
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
Roman one
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's two projects identified under a
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me let me back up just a second
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
if you look in row three it says the
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
amount of 369 000 and change
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
is hereby labsed and then right after
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that it identifies two projects those
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
are two projects that were completed
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
and in our review and working with the
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
agency during when this capital budget
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
was being built was determined that
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
there would be about 369 thousand
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
dollars total between the two projects
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
that could be repurposed or reused
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and then under
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
row 10 you'll see there's a sum
 
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.090 align:start position:0%
row 10 you'll see there's a sum
appropriated

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
for a purpose and in this case it was to
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety for their State
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
Police Hangar Construction
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
and then row 13 would just let the
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer know that the these are still
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
bonded funds
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then the treasurer keeps track of
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes just to
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
clarify so in other words those projects
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
ran into Surplus they didn't know if it
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
spent that's correct perfect okay thank
 
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.110 align:start position:0%
spent that's correct perfect okay thank
you

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
you
what

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
so just one thing I didn't mention
 
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.970 align:start position:0%
so just one thing I didn't mention
um

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
you passed the capital budget and then
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
your work is done
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
there is a committee the capital budget
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
overview committee which some of you
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
will be members of
 
00:25:59.529 --> 00:25:59.539 align:start position:0%
um that does look at capital budget
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
projects agencies will come in
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
provide status updates or they may come
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
in and ask for some um
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
so there's some limited ability to
 
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
so there's some limited ability to
transfer

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
Appropriations between projects that
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
were funded in the same capital budget
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
so the capital budget overview committee
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
is has the authority to approve the that
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
process so if there is a project a that
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
completes and there's a hundred thousand
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
dollar Surplus and there's a project B
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
that needs a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
and it's in the same capital budget so
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
it was in the 2021 capital budget for
 
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.690 align:start position:0%
it was in the 2021 capital budget for
example

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
um they can come to capital budget
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
overview and make the request to move
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand over to complete
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the other project that was
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
um that enough money wasn't funded for
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
so it's a way to basically the the
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
legislature has said we're allowing 120
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars to be bonded or whatever
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
for these projects we want these
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
projects done and it allows the agencies
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
to do some of that
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview also receives
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports on the status of all
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
the projects
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I didn't bring mine with me but
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
provides this report to the committee so
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
you can see if you know at any time what
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
the kind of the status is of a project
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
is it in planning is it in building has
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
it been completed has it been delayed
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
so now I'm really done talking
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
unless there's any questions
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
the um the Committees that Chris is
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
referring to uh capital budget overview
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
and long-range planning uh typically
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
meet quarterly and there is a meeting
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
scheduled for I believe the 10th of next
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
month which will happen in this room
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
before we meet so if you want to come by
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and see the excitement that happens
 
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
there you're you're more than welcome to
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
come by for that so
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the member the membership from our
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee has has already been named so
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
I remember as a freshman going up to my
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
chairman and saying I'd love to be on
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
that committee and he said it's
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
typically not there but yeah I was
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
always invited to those meetings with
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
him so
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
I think once you see a couple of those
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
you'll be pretty well filled in but I
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
believe it's a 10th and I believe we
 
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
start at uh nine o'clock for those two
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
meetings so with that Chris I really
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time that you've spent
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
here with us and Chris will be with us
 
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
or one of his uh assistants will be with
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
us through most of the process so I
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
so we will now move to our Lottery
 
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.049 align:start position:0%
so we will now move to our Lottery
Commission

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
Jim Durham's Chief Financial Officer for
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Lottery Commission I'm
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
sorry name again sir Jim Doris I'm a
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
little bit stuffy today no uh no problem
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
welcome to public welcome to Public
 
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.889 align:start position:0%
welcome to public welcome to Public
Works

00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
Works
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
so uh this will probably be a little
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
more different than what you're used to
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
but uh as you all know Lottery is
 
00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.090 align:start position:0%
but uh as you all know Lottery is
self-funded

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh for example when we purchased our
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
building that was not purchased by the
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
general fund it was purchased by the New
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery Enterprise fund
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
so going into the budget process this
 
00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:37.669 align:start position:0%
so going into the budget process this
year

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
we are unsure how to handle things a
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
little bit so we were advised that we
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
could put our requests into the capital
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
budget request and we also put it as a
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
digital prioritized need in our
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
which would of course use our funds
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
rather than general fund to do the
 
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.210 align:start position:0%
rather than general fund to do the
project

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget he did accept
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
those prioritized needs
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
um as part of our operating budget for
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
so what we are proposing to do is
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
withdraw our request for a capital
 
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.750 align:start position:0%
withdraw our request for a capital
budget

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful sir
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for the
 
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:15.860 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
if I could while I have you here so that
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
um that building sits away from the main
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
campus and across the river correct and
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
that you had said earlier that that
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
building was purchased yes and owned by
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
The Lottery Commission yes okay we we
 
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:36.260 align:start position:0%
purchased the building
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
2019 uh we did it through a commercial
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
loan from a private bank
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
um after two and a half years we
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
outright paid off the note and took
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
ownership of full ownership of the
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
building at that time thank you sir
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes please representative I'll take
 
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
credit for that one uh I put that in the
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
budget because the director assured me
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
that they could pay the note on the
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
building for equal or less than what the
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
rent was going to be and there was
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
insecurity if they didn't do that of
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
their ability to stay any kind of
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
long-term uh contract the the owner of
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
the building was considering selling
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and it just seemed to
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
secure it and to give them extra
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
incentive and we put it in the budget we
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
authorized them to buy the building and
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
if the landlord wouldn't sell we
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
authorized them to build on campus which
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
incented the
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
the owner
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank thank you for the
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
history too representative and
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
and your continued hard work
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions for
 
00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:48.590 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions for
Audrey

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
Audrey
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thank you for bringing
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
so to our our advantage those funds then
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
we will we will have an opportunity to
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
discuss where those funds uh will be
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
distributed as we go along
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll hold a lot of that
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
conversation for after we've heard the
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
the needs of of all the Departments and
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
then we'll start through that process
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to go back to
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
um to note chairman Graham sitting in
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
um our our capital budget if if it's if
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's if we during the process we will
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
work our way through this we may not all
 
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
agree on each and every item but in the
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
past and I knowing the group as I do now
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
will reach a consensus before we're done
 
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.610 align:start position:0%
will reach a consensus before we're done
here

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:57.620 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
and when we get to that point and before
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
it comes to the house floor it's going
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
to be important that you communicate
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
with the people that sit around you
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh and say you know this is why we came
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
here because it's not always totally
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
pleasing to the whole legislature but if
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
we talk about it and the we have a
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
reputation in the house of working
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
together and we will still so speak to
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
people about it if they have questions I
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
really don't like this bring it to John
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
bring it to myself
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can incorporate that and it
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
has been the pleasure of
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
most every chairman that I have been
 
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:43.700 align:start position:0%
here that when we reach the floor
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
we will we will pass over a hundred
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
million dollars on a Voice vote and
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
that'll be a credit to this committee
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
when we get there so just keep that in
 
00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.140 align:start position:0%
mind if you hear issues bring them to us
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
and we will try and head off any small
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
fires before it happens so with that we
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of 20 minutes yes
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
the the committee of conference on last
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
year's capital budget was 10 minutes so
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
that was also non-controversial exercise
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Brandon so the committee of
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
conference is uh we've sent it to the
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate sends it back to us
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
and if we don't agree then we choose and
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
we will choose to uh
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
um to have that conversation and that's
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
what the committee of conference is
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
about so if you didn't know what that
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
was that'll take part in uh in a in a
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
room senators and representatives and we
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
thrash that out and it hasn't been as
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
representative Jack says hasn't been
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
overly controversial for a number of
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
years so
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
so if there's no further questions at
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
this point treat yourself to 20 minutes
 
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:27.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
time being 11 o'clock we will now
 
00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:45.859 align:start position:0%
continue with the governor's office
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
and listen to the budget director James
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
is it Gary or Jerry it's Gary Gary thank
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you for the committee the
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
governor's Offices here so we brought
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
out the big
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
the big banger go ahead sir
 
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:01.730 align:start position:0%
the big banger go ahead sir
okay

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is James Gary and
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the budget director for the State of
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as such I'm here to
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
present the governor's capital budget
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. I plan
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
on giving a brief presentation overview
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
on you know really get to the point of
 
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:26.780 align:start position:0%
why we
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
chose to fund the projects we did and
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
then open up to the floor for any
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee members
 
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:35.660 align:start position:0%
as the state emerged from the covid
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
pandemic we saw a pent-up demand for
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
capital projects in the last two years
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
remarked by supply chain shortages as
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
well as large price increases for both
 
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
materials and labor that is if you could
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
find those items at all
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
so under that guys last spring the
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
put out the call for any departments in
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
the state excuse me the head Capital
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
needs to submit their proposals
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
typically the capital budget that the
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
governor submits is usually in the 120
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
maybe upwards of 130 million dollar
 
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:11.329 align:start position:0%
maybe upwards of 130 million dollar
range

00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
for this capital budget we received
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
requests for 750 million dollars of
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
projects to be funded from the general
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
fund with total projects including those
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
from other state sources and federal
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
revenue to totaling over just over one
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
now typically when you get requests like
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
this uh you see about maybe it's about
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
10 percent uh that's a rough figure
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
which I would call fluff and when I
 
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
Define fluff as as a want not a need
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's not something that is irrelevant to
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
something you would never fund but it's
 
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
typically something that's not needed
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
more that's wanted now if you want to
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
fund 130 million dollars of projects and
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
140 million dollars of requests come in
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
and you cut the 10 the 10 of fluff off
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
you can do that and still be within your
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
targets however when you have 750
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars of general fund requests
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
and you're looking to get down to 130
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
million and you cut the 10 off or that
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
leaves you 675 675 million you know
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
which is still as a magnitude of five of
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
where we want to be
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
so uh obviously uh and clearly
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
significant Cuts had to be had to be
 
00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.069 align:start position:0%
significant Cuts had to be had to be
made

00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
our goals when we decided to fund these
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
projects were as follows we wanted to
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
leverage as much Federal money to the
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
fullest extent possible
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
we wanted to spread out funding so that
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
no one department or government sector
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we want to be sure that no one
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
project was disproportionately funded
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
the result of this exercise is what we
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
present here in the capital budget
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
the governor submitted a list of 15
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
departments for 42 separate projects
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
totaling 247.4 million overall with
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
129.9 million coming from general fund
 
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.910 align:start position:0%
129.9 million coming from general fund
sources

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
16.8 million coming from other revenues
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
and 99.8 million coming from federal
 
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.609 align:start position:0%
and 99.8 million coming from federal
sources

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
this of course meant that three-quarters
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
of a billion dollars of projects were
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
not funded via this capital budget
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
despite the requests if we chose not to
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
fund a project that is not a statement
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
on whether the project is a worthwhile
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
project but rather is it a statement of
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
not only our prioritization but their
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
prioritization and in a mechanism that
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
allows the state to live within its
 
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
allows the state to live within its
means

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
so given our goals of keeping the
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
general fund portion under 130 million
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
dollars fund a diverse set of
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
departments and project types all the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
while to the extent possible leveraging
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
as much federal dollars as possible this
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
meant that roughly 25 percent of the
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
total project requests could be funded
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and only 20 percent of the general fund
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
projects could be funded as well
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
now when the governor opened a capital
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
budget hearings this past July he spoke
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
about funding part of the state's
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
capital projects or Surplus from the FY
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 23 budget in fact the
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor is proposing proposing in hb2
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
an additional 224.5 million in projects
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
to be funded with fiscal year 23 Surplus
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that a significant
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
portion of these projects are not your
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
typical capital projects rather they are
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
grants designed designed to address
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
significant needs of the state and
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
they include a 30 million dollar grant
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
for invest NH which will fund up to 1
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
000 new housing units 25 million dollar
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
grant for the affordable housing fund a
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
4.5 million dollar uh grant for a
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
computer science initiative that will
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact on every public
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school in the
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
state and 10 million dollars for an
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
initial down payment for a new state
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
prison for men in Concord that will
 
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:01.700 align:start position:0%
replace the existing structure
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
with that there are a few projects that
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
I want to bring to your attention that
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
have changed since the last submission
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
one I believe you are aware of uh the
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
875 thousand dollars for the Lottery
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
Commission is no longer requested uh we
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
we did fund
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
a maintenance request for them in their
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget and they believe that
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
will be sufficient so the 875 that's
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
here now is no longer requested you have
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
something else I want to bring your
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
attention is the 10.5 million dollar
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
request for the Department of Education
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
and for that that's that is to purchase
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
their basically their headquarters where
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
they where they operate out of and it's
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
25 Hall Street and the original budget
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
request for that was seven million
 
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.010 align:start position:0%
request for that was seven million
dollars

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
and that was based off of uh that it is
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
a sale between UNH and and the New
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of Education UNH
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
currently owns the building and the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
initial price of seven million dollars
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
was based on the fact of a commercial
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
real estate expert that UNH consulted
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
who uh did some comparables some comps
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
and and gave out that seven million
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
dollar figure uh it was not an official
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
appraisal it was not an official asking
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
price it was just the back of the
 
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
envelope type but based off of an
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
expert's opinion
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh and when the administrative Services
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh priced it out uh I think as as I hear
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
often on legal shows they assume facts
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
that were not in evidence and the uh The
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
price came back at 10.5 million that
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
that is not the price uh the real price
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
will be determined Upon A an appraisal
 
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
an official appraisal that will have to
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
be done on the project so it can be done
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
at sort of an arms links transaction as
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
much as possible between those two
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
entities and that will be that will be
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
the price uh uh UNH and Department of
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
Education are not expecting that uh
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
appraisal to be significantly different
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
than the seven million dollars that they
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh banded about last July so that
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
request as well probably should come
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
down by a couple of million dollars
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
yeah and with that I'll gladly open up
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
to any questions
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
thank you before I do that so
 
01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:32.339 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any idea when that
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
negotiation will finally be entered will
 
01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:38.660 align:start position:0%
it be while the capital budget is still
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
within the house or is that at a time
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the Senate that is my
 
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the Senate that is my
hope

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
um if you know upon upon with
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
consultation to you and upon your
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
direction we can we can give them but I
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
don't think they need to go ahead from
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
me or certainly from us to do it but I
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
think getting it this is the project you
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
are likely to fund then I think that
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
getting an appraisal done uh very
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
quickly is is so you know what you're
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with would be the way to go that
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and just for background the
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
university didn't own that building for
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
an awful long time did they was it in
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
less than 10 years or so I believe so
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
yes and and when they took possession of
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
that building were there millions of
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of Renovations are you
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
aware of that they had done to that bill
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
building I'm not aware the renovations
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
they've done I do know that the doe is
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
actually in that building now and
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
they've been renting it from the
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
University so they're they're clearly
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
happy with the building they want to buy
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
it and it certainly fits their needs as
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
is okay thank you
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
um May I
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman if you don't mind a
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the overall
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
presentation Mr Gary but in fact this is
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
about the Department of Education and I
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
was just curious if you could tell us
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
the governor's thinking about why for
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
the first time in 20 years since I've
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
been on this committee there is no
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
funding for any ctes in his capital
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
budget requests for the first time and
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm as I said so if you could tell us
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
anything about why the governor did not
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
include any funding please thank you
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
okay there actually is funding for for
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
ctes in the budget there's uh there
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
there were two that were submitted uh
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
there was that the Newport CTE which I
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
believe was roughly around 11 million
 
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:35.420 align:start position:0%
dollars and then there was the Tilton
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
CTE for the winus Guam School District
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
which was around six million dollars we
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
funded the larger request which was the
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
the Newport CTE the the Tilton CTE was
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
not funded for a variety of reasons
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
first and foremost it has not gone
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
before the voters yet while the Newport
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
CTE has been approved by the local
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
voters that Tilton one has not yet I
 
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:00.980 align:start position:0%
believe their
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
their that goes before the voters at
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
their town meeting which I believe is
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
right around March it's uh March 25th or
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and so we'll
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
know more than
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we view any sort of
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
request uh in in the context not only is
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
the request good and you know should we
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
fund it because we do support and the
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
government does support ctes but it has
 
01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
to be viewed in the overall context and
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
the overall context of the department of
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
education budget this budget increases
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education's uh funding
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
by over nine percent which is the
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
largest increase in over 20 years in
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
addition to that we're spending over 100
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
million dollars of building aid for for
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
other schools across the state state to
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
get built and
 
01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:49.849 align:start position:0%
get built and
um

01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah in addition to that we look at
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
their prioritized needs list on their
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs list there were five
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
things requested the the Tilton CTE
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
Center was number four out of five so uh
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
again had it been approved by the voters
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
we may have had a different viewpoint on
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
it but we have you know if we if we put
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
that in and then it doesn't get approved
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
by the voters we've taken that's six
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars away from something else
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
on the list that we would have had to
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
have cut
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you a question
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
when you say funding so it's not in the
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget though House Bill
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
20 if it's in it's in another budget the
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
funding for Newport
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh it is in the cap it is it is an hp2
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
when it's HP tool okay I just wanted to
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
be sure it's not in the capital budget
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
you're ready and I'm I'm familiar just
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the committee because
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
it's uh of the Newport because I know
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's been approved the local share
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
because it's in my area so but I want to
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
be very clear as far as newport's
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
concerned but thank you for contribution
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
but it is an hp2 yes sir
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Jefferson thank
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh director Jerry you you
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
funding for school buildings are these
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I didn't catch it are these new
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
school buildings or these improvements
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
and repairs
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
their improvements in repairs
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's existing schools updated and
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
upkeep and maintenance on existing
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
schools you got it thank you thank you
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
and uh for the representative
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it has been traditional when more
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
monies have been there that we renovate
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
two of these and over the course of uh
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
10 years we have come back to each one
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
of these uh schools and made
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
improvements what's starting to happen
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
is as
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
gentlemen is mentioned the cost factor
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
is becoming so high or the want of the
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh the community is so high that it's
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
making it difficult to fully fund but
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's always been a very high priority of
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
this uh committee thank you if I could
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
ask so there's no Community College
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
money in here can you explain to me is
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
that coming in somewhere else or could
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
you tell me what the governor's thoughts
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
is on that place the Community College
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
um one was was a tough one
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and if we had more money that's you
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
know I think that's where it would have
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
been funded what we did this year was uh
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
we had a priority to them of of
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
increasing their budget after being flat
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
funded for a number of bienniums we
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
increased their operating budget roughly
 
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.020 align:start position:0%
by 13 percent
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh but the the bottom line is is that
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
the community college system and it may
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
be a little unfair to them was crowded
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
out by the university system uh
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
six years ago the state made a
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
commitment to the university system to
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
fund their capital projects and I
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
believe it was 10 million in the first
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
biennium 15 million in the second and 17
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
million in this biennium and with that
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
and some other projects we're funding in
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
hb2 as I mentioned
 
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.970 align:start position:0%
hb2 as I mentioned
um

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
allowing uh or keeping the
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
the no one government sector or part of
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
government to have a very large impact
 
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.020 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget or or
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
what we did in hb2 was tandem out and
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
the university system took up basically
 
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of the oxygen the other thing was
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is more of a capital
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
what is a capital project debate a lot
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
of their projects were and I think badly
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
needed uh maintenance where that
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance is ongoing maintenance or a
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
true Capital maintenance meaning it
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
lasts Beyond five years and it's
 
01:11:50.169 --> 01:11:50.179 align:start position:0%
something you can legitimately bond for
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh is is a question but I do believe
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
they they absolutely have needs and uh
 
01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:58.460 align:start position:0%
if they're not addressed in this budget
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
whether it's myself or whoever is doing
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
it two years from now uh you know with
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
with the commitment to the university
 
01:12:06.179 --> 01:12:07.610 align:start position:0%
with the commitment to the university
system

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
gone I was looking for the community
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
colleges to step up to the plate
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that sir other questions
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes represent Boyd
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr Gary thank you
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
for for your testimony today
 
01:12:22.199 --> 01:12:23.229 align:start position:0%
for for your testimony today
um

01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
dovetailing off of the off of the
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
Chairman's questions regarding community
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
colleges was there any Community College
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
that offered a project that obviously
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't make the cut but was right
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
there that got a lot of consideration
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
that might be worthy of this committee's
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
attention yeah I believe when they when
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
they submitted that they only had a
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
couple of requests and they they didn't
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know when they put in the request
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
they did not do it as an individual
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
project but they did it as a list of
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
projects where they said maintenance for
 
01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:01.460 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
and uh it it I would say they came very
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
close uh because again
 
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.470 align:start position:0%
close uh because again
um

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance of facilities is is
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
something that not only affects the
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
community college system but the state
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole if we took all 129 million
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing here and you gave
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
it to commissioner arlinghaus and said
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
you know do maintenance with this he
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
would say thank you that's a good down
 
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.570 align:start position:0%
would say thank you that's a good down
payment

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:28.580 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
and uh because that's what maintenance
 
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
it is and what the status of Maintenance
 
01:13:36.729 --> 01:13:36.739 align:start position:0%
as it is today and it's only been
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
exacerbated uh over the last three years
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
since March of 2020 because you know due
 
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.050 align:start position:0%
since March of 2020 because you know due
to

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh funding you know lack of funding
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
because we obviously had a significant
 
01:13:51.649 --> 01:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
drop in revenues during that time the
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
initial time and then with supply chain
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
issues and pricing increases doing the
 
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.050 align:start position:0%
issues and pricing increases doing the
maintenance

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh was was
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to do you know so the
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
need is there the news there throughout
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
the state but you know I would say yes
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're very close
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Boyd and I
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
will come to you sir in a moment and no
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
disrespect to the governor's budget uh
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
we will we will ask
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
departments when they come
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
um you know what were some of the needs
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
that you felt you know you should have
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that we are going to
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
agree that money but we'll at least
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look at that internally and
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
see if there's some wiggle room
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
my feeling this is my fourth term
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
to try and stay as close to the
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget as possible
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
the reason is everybody votes for him
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
what all the things you're saying could
 
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:07.580 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to us if we knew
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
what he cut
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
so that we at least have some argument
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
so some kind of printed document on the
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
cuts he made relative to our budget that
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
we have to come up with
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's possible uh
 
01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
okay that's possible uh
it's

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'll have to think whether it's possible
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
or not uh but one thing I can I can say
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and this sort of addresses your question
 
01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
sir as well is that this is the
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget proposal it's
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's now your capital budget right and
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's free for you to work on and and
 
01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.229 align:start position:0%
it's free for you to work on and and
what

01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
my job is going to be over the next few
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
months until June 30th is to work with
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
you because it eventually it is the
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget proposal it's now your
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
budget and eventually it's going to have
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
to become our budget and so to work
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
closely with you and uh we we fully
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
realize that while these are our
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
priorities your priorities May differ
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
and we can if you have projects that uh
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly you're you're interested in in
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding and uh you know replacing some
 
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
of the proposals we've made we can we
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
can certainly work with you on that and
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
I can
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
do my best in coming up with a with a a
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
better uh explanation as to which
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
projects we're in and which projects
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
were out again the scope is is very
 
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:43.100 align:start position:0%
large it's you know roughly
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
850 well well 750 million dollars of
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
projects were cut so it's a big task
 
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:54.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you both I believe uh
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
touche mentioned in the beginning one of
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
our documents has all of the requests by
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
departments that were brought to the
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
governor so we have we have that list
 
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.729 align:start position:0%
governor so we have we have that list
and

01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
um we will as each department comes in
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
if you want to cue in on where that was
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
and we asked them
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
um you know if there was something that
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know didn't make the list you know
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
will will start compiling that list and
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
when we get to the end you know we may
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
have a possibility of a couple million
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
dollars here and eight hundred thousand
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
dollars there we we as a group will will
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
figure that out so I don't think we need
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
to burden the gentleman on that so any
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
other questions yes represent counter
 
01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.790 align:start position:0%
other questions yes represent counter
yeah

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um do you know
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
who's in charge of uh like uh Bridges uh
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
as far as maintenance and building or
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
rebuilding it would depend on which
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
Bridge uh if their state on is it's the
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
department of obviously it runs through
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation okay
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
but many of our bridges are locally
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
owned okay uh as well so it really
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
depends on on which bridge I imagine
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
there are obviously some federal as well
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you sir me thank you very much

um

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
so we have we have one more hearing at
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
11 30 Department of Information
 
01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.790 align:start position:0%
11 30 Department of Information
Technology

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
Technology
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then we will be going to uh luncheon
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
coming back for one o'clock
 
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
coming back for one o'clock
and

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
this shade you have something else to
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
add I just wanted to um
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
respond to representative's question so
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
the agencies that are coming before you
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
have been asked to
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
um not only talk about what's been
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the governor's
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
recommended capital budget but to also
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
bring forward any items that they feel
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
that they would still like to have
 
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.450 align:start position:0%
that they would still like to have
considered

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
for a capital project so I think to to
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
go out kind of um dovetail on what
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
director Gary was saying you know
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's some fluff maybe there's some
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
projects that can wait but then there
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
may be critical projects and those are
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
what the agencies will come I believe
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
and talk to you about if it didn't get
 
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:46.940 align:start position:0%
included in the in the capital budget
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
secondly the reference to House Bill 2
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
so there are some projects that are
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
being funded through House Bill 2 uh the
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
prison I think representative that's not
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gary director Gary
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned that as well as the CTE our
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
office has put together a preliminary
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
listing of the House Bill 2
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
Appropriations based on what the
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget contained I can make
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
copies of that and bring that back to
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
the committee it's also on our website
 
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.470 align:start position:0%
the committee it's also on our website
um

01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.630 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
to to the point that director Gary was
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
making there are some truly what you
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
would have seen as capital projects
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
coming through here as well as projects
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
that you might not otherwise have seen
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
But due to the Surplus that the uh the
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay please yes Mr Shea isn't I've been
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
told that I mean hb1 that basically an
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
HB 25 the the operating budget and
 
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
capital budget have been released but
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill which is House Bill 2
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
all the details haven't been released
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
yet are is that correct
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 2 is is being drafted
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
right now by office legislative Services
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly extensive document so it's
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to take a little bit of time
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
um for those for their attorneys to get
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
that completed
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so no it hasn't been released
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
um in House Bill 2 format the governor's
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
office transmitted to the office of
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislative services to um draft just as
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
they did House Bill 25 and House Bill
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
one house bill one is a fairly easy
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
document to produce so that has been
 
01:21:23.699 --> 01:21:25.490 align:start position:0%
document to produce so that has been
introduced

01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.530 align:start position:0%
introduced
um

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:26.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
the house bill 25 and House Bill 2 takes
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in terms of the
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
drafting associated with that it's
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
basically making sure the legislation
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's being cited in there or changed
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
is not impacting other legislation
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
throughout our statutes so it does take
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
a few moments for them to get that done
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
on top of
 
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.250 align:start position:0%
on top of
um

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
everything else that OLS is doing on a
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
day-to-day with the Committees and
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
getting ready for session
 
01:21:51.719 --> 01:21:52.669 align:start position:0%
getting ready for session
um

01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think I heard it I heard somebody also
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
talk about the revenues or make a
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
comment about the revenues revenues are
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
on track
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
I believe the chair's desire is to try
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
to finalize those next week
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
which is in line with prior years
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
it's actually if I look back
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
three budgets ago it would be a week
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
earlier two budgets ago be a week right
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
on the last budget it's a week later
 
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
on the last budget it's a week later
however

01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
however
um

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
last budget the Ways and Means Committee
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
did come up with its revenues and the
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
finance committee asked the ways and
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
means to go back and re-look at their
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
revenues so they had a second set of
 
01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up request yeah could you
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could email us copies of
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
what the projects that are in-house Bill
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
to especially because I'm interested in
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Newport CTE and to help answer any
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
questions constituents who are concerned
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
about this issue if you could send us
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
send us this information I would
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate it please I'll send an email
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
to the entire committee with the
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
document attached to it I can bring hard
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
copies if the desire is there for that
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to be misunderstood
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
it's not that I'm going to agree with
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
all the governor's cuts my concern is
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
that the final number
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
is that we create as close to the final
 
01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.229 align:start position:0%
is that we create as close to the final
number

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
as we can so but any information that's
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
available is so we we can make a
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
decision one way or the other is going
 
01:23:34.689 --> 01:23:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.699 --> 01:23:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
and and not to be
 
01:23:38.699 --> 01:23:42.590 align:start position:0%
and and not to be
um

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
so the binder that was sitting here that
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
I moved over to there those were all the
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
this this is what
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
was all the requests made to the
 
01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:58.430 align:start position:0%
was all the requests made to the
governor

01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
this is what made it out so you have the
 
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
the summary list for this document
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
what's in here
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
whatever didn't make it into this green
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
document is what the governor said we
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're not going to fund for whatever
 
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
we're not going to fund for whatever
reason

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
and and that book will stay on my desk
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
in in there and you're free to come in
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%

um and you know be able to formulate
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
your questions from there
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
funded project that was that's been in
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
process during this biennium to
 
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.610 align:start position:0%
process during this biennium to
um

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
Implement uh what they're calling uh
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
their modernization of their One-Stop
 
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
One Stop is there
 
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:00.770 align:start position:0%
One Stop is there
um

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
agency specific place where you go to
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
get services on their website and the
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
applications themselves are pretty old
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
and they're not as friendly to the to
 
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
the community as they could be so that
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
process is ongoing right now and the
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
agency is requesting additional funds to
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
keep doing that and you can see it's
 
01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:22.940 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty extensive they have
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
you know 200 individual programs that
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
they that they want to consolidate into
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
a single way of doing business and a
 
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.689 align:start position:0%
a single way of doing business and a
single

01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:31.699 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
data structure so we can get better they
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
actually have a mountain of valuable
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
information that's a bit hard to get to
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
because it's it's all over the place so
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're working closely with the agency on
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
that project and we'll continue to do so
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
should this be funded
 
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.209 align:start position:0%
should this be funded
um

01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
basically some other details there
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
associated with it in the um in addition
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
to the one stop
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
under additional I.T needs
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
and here's where we get to Bridges
 
01:31:09.129 --> 01:31:09.139 align:start position:0%
so so this is your
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
Bridges is uh is a code name for a
 
01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
system that's been in place for many
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
many years that was supporting the child
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
welfare system and uh
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
and they use some some technology stuff
 
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
here current states a 23 year old Power
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
Builder power Builder what does that
 
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
mean it's a real old
 
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
um uh really actually was in its day was
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
a really good application development
 
01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:35.629 align:start position:0%
a really good application development
platform

01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and clearly it's it's still running
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
today so um it's still pretty solid but
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
you can't find people that will that can
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
actually work on it and it's not well
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
supported so it really does need an
 
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:51.380 align:start position:0%
upgrade this is really moving into a
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
multi-biennium project that that needs
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
to keep going to both
 
01:31:58.679 --> 01:31:59.270 align:start position:0%
to keep going to both
um

01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
be compliant with Federal funding but
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
also and and really I think really
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
importantly to modernize how we process
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
data in that so that the folks who are
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
out there um
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
in you know supporting children and and
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
helping to keep them safe are actually
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
doing less work to input their data and
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
having that data be input in a more
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
accurate fashion so that a higher
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of the time is being spent on
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
what their core mission is versus
 
01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
managing data
 
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.570 align:start position:0%
managing data
that's

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to I'm happy to take questions
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
and as they go along or at the end
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
the the next one on page six is the um
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
electronic health records system
 
01:32:52.129 --> 01:32:52.139 align:start position:0%
basically what this would do is uh for
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the committee and and
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
members who are listed are folks who are
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
listening in electronic health records
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
is really the heart and soul of of you
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
know if you're thinking about if you
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
were in a hospital or an emergency room
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's the system that keeps
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
track of everything they're pretty large
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
systems complex and
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
um and basically most most health care
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
institutions couldn't live without them
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
in in these days because of the the um
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know the amount of information
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's carried in there today in uh HHS
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
they have you know multiple systems that
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
are supporting different parts of their
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
business this this project would bring
 
01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.970 align:start position:0%
business this this project would bring
together

01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
all of the known electronic health
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
records requirements and support some
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
new things that we have coming on
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
the uh the new forensic Hospital
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
and you can see at the very last bullet
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
there it's pretty extensive on how many
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
people would be using it and how many
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
external entities would also be
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
um be uh have access to in it to help us
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
you know better serve as a as an
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
integrated community
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
and finally uh last agency project is
 
01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.110 align:start position:0%
and finally uh last agency project is
energy

01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
um I know we we talk about
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
this committee's often talking about
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
buildings so the this is an analog to
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the their current system is the analog
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
to that building and that the roof has
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
needed to be replaced for a decade but
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
hasn't been so it's been leaking and
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
causing internal damage so that's kind
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the analog here to Energy System they
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
really need this in fact when I joined
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
the state in 2015 I this function was
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
over in the um uh strategic initiatives
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
group and they were talking about
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
needing it to be replaced eight years
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
ago so so it is pretty pretty much in
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
need and particularly now you know
 
01:34:58.850 --> 01:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
driving efficiency and Effectiveness in
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
the aid that we're able to give out in
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
the in the energy sector through this
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
LIHEAP program I think it's it's a it's
 
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
a good and important project
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
so that that really concludes all the
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
agency projects that were
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
proposed under the governor's capital
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
budget now I'm going to move on to the
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
doit projects
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
the first one and this has been
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
before we go there uh are there are
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
there questions on the first part of
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
this presentation yes represent Barber
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
ah thank you Mr chairman uh my curiosity
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
is what does a roof have to do with I.T
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I know the building needs a new
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
roof as you said but I'm information
 
01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.330 align:start position:0%
roof as you said but I'm information
technology

01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with Roofing
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
um well it it really is it was an it was
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
an analog
 
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:54.770 align:start position:0%
an analog
um

01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh but basically
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
um if you neglect an I.T system
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
it has similar effects to neglecting a
 
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
building in terms of the effectiveness
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
I believe we need a little more
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
explanation for the gentleman
 
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
explanation for the gentleman
um

01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.229 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
I I believe we're struggling with the
 
01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
word I.T
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
analog in your reference to the roof
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I I was just make making a comparison
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
um you know when you look at um
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
making comparison when you look at um
 
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know we we struggle to keep our
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
buildings uh maintained and and and we
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a similar situation for some of our
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
I.T systems as well so my apologies for
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
not being clear on that
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Jack uh thank
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you it's good
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
to see you uh you have money over on the
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
Child Welfare you have money in 21 and
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
you have money in 19 and this is now uh
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
if I understand what you've said
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
correctly this would be the last time
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
you would need the more money for the
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
child welfare you expect to wrap it up
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
in this biennium that's my understanding
 
01:37:06.659 --> 01:37:11.450 align:start position:0%
in this biennium that's my understanding
sir

01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
represent Boyd might have to move you
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
closer over here that's okay I like it
 
01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
here okay representative Edgar is
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
keeping me honest all right thank you Mr
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh commissioner thank you very
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
much for
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
your presentation so far
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
um looking at the the bridges
 
01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.330 align:start position:0%
um looking at the the bridges
replacement

01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize if this is a little
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
bit sensitive but
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
um dcyf unfortunately has had two issues
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
as it relates to two two children that
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
that fell through the CIS that fell
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
through the cracks for the lack of a
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
better term are these enhancements going
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
to allow our dcfy
 
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
dcyf work is being able to have a more
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
higher level of access to information so
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
that they're able to do their job more
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
effectively and more timely
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
um part of part of the the desire here
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
is to have
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
better access to information while
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're in the field but also um a a an
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
ability to update information more
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
easily while in the field so that should
 
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
that should serve uh to make them I
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
think more effective
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up thank you
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm not
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say this because my wife and
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
I we adopted our daughter through dcyf
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to remember what her
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
caseworker always brought when we are in
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
the process of fostering to adopt it but
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
are are these caseworkers equipped with
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
like an iPad or some type of an app on
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
their phone where they're documenting
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
information real time and then it's
 
01:38:42.729 --> 01:38:42.739 align:start position:0%
being transmitted
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
the the bridges system uh that exists
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
today isn't isn't particularly strong in
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
that in that case for the you know
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
managing remotely so that's one of the
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
big improvements that's desired to make
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
with so they'll it'll synchronize yes
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah actually it wouldn't need
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
to synchronize it all be it be real time
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
perfect okay thank you thank you uh
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the um I want
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
to go to uh DS which I believe was the
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
first one you talked about in the ones
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
tool is used all the time it's wonderful
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
and the department wanting to finally
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
scan in all of the um I think right now
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
if you were to look for a septic design
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
online it'd have to be from like 2005 so
 
01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
they're trying to go backwards and make
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
those documents because they're
 
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
extremely hard to find and we keep
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
spending valuable time going to pull out
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
documents so I I applaud that that
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's happening the issue is with
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
another department by Environmental
 
01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:49.820 align:start position:0%
Services which is Shoreland and wetlands
 
01:39:54.370 --> 01:39:54.380 align:start position:0%
and while they use the service it is not
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
friendly to the residents who are
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
looking for information
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
do you know if Des could start working
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
some of those that paperwork into this
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
stream so it can be seen because there
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
are no documents here right or if that
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
is a future project Capital project that
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
they're coming with
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
um that there's another initiative going
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
on now that's has been funded with arpa
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
funds for permitting
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
and we're in fact we just brought on
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
um this week the program manager to run
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
with it and and it's a it's a permitting
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
project that was funded for D.O.T and
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
Des and the idea there is to very
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
significantly modernize the permitting
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
processes and there's a bunch of them in
 
01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:48.020 align:start position:0%
in Des
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
Wetlands is one of the ones we're
 
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
thinking we're looking for those first
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
use cases to you know in other words
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
we'd like to add capabilities in an
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
incremental fashion so we're not waiting
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
until we're done everything to add value
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
in in certain places and and Des is
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
considering the the wetlands as one of
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
the early use cases that we would um we
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
would tackle
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
I I would hope it continues on that way
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the new members
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
um when that when monies were hard to
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
find and
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
um you sir have mentioned this before
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
the uh when we started in with computer
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
systems in the state instead of buying
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
products that were out there whether
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
products software and I'm messing this
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
up representative Jack I'm sure but
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so we had some ingenious employees
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
and others that started coding and
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
making programs and we used them for a
 
01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
long time and and then those departments
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
would come in and they want to spend
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
more time to this but then people were
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
retiring and the people that were
 
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:54.500 align:start position:0%
maintaining these for the new members
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
were no longer available and we were in
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
a true bind and your department sir was
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
charged with funneling a lot of if I
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
remember correctly funnel a lot of those
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
projects through them so that we and
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
others had a good understanding ending
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
that this was the best way to do it and
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
I believe in many cases now as you're
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
hearing now with the bridges that we're
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
we're finally getting to that point and
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's under your oversight and I'm
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
I'm very appreciative of of that work
 
01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
that you do and another benefit too and
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
that and I should have mentioned this as
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
it relates to Bridges but it also it
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
holds true here what we find is when if
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
we have cyber security assessments we
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
find that the older systems are much
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
more likely to have vulnerabilities in
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
them because of you know it wasn't a
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
thing that people cared about 20 25
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
years about ago and it's it's a big deal
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
now so you may Mr chair you may recall
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
when we took down a lot of those ones
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
those One-Stop systems because we found
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
some significant vulnerabilities and we
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to protect citizen data so we
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
took them down and then we incrementally
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
brought them back up once they were
 
01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
remediated but that is the kind of thing
 
01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
that we challenged we had with older
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
systems that we'd definitely like to
 
01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.709 align:start position:0%
systems that we'd definitely like to
address

01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there any other
 
01:43:14.219 --> 01:43:16.669 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there any other
questions

01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming thank you
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
oh sorry let's go
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
um so um on page eight There's a summary
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the doit capital requests
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a little bit down I think
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's about a million and a half down
 
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
approved from um from last biennium I'm
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
not complaining it's just a statement of
 
01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.850 align:start position:0%
not complaining it's just a statement of
fact

01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
um we all we almost always prioritize
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
cyber security as number one and and the
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
reason is it's important but also the
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
bar keeps moving so what used was a good
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
job eight years ago wouldn't be adequate
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
today so so the bar keeps moving on us
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have to keep up with it and I'll go
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
into a little more detail on that when
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
we get to the the detail part of it the
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
financial systems modernization
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I I use the I use the comparison of
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
the landscaper's yard here right so a
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
lot of times you drive by a landscaper's
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
house in their yard doesn't look so good
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
because they're spending all their time
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
getting everybody else's yard looking
 
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
good that's that's what our financial
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
systems modernization is is a bit we
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
have we have some need to improve there
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
and then service management is is really
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
um a science and an art that helps us do
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
more with the people we have measure
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
ourselves better for Effectiveness so
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
I'll take you through that one by one
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
starting with page nine
 
01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.030 align:start position:0%
starting with page nine
so

01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
the first bullet there is interesting
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
because what's happened in the cyber
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
security space is there's so much
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
information we are now Gathering
 
01:44:59.689 --> 01:44:59.699 align:start position:0%
that we're having trouble with humans
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
keeping up with it and correlating and
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
figuring out what's good and isn't good
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
so you see these s-i-e-m and soar I'll
 
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
simplify that by saying that what that
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
does is modernize the way information is
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
is gathered and analyzed so that you
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need human eyes on
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
something all the time to catch a
 
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:18.649 align:start position:0%
something all the time to catch a
problem

01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:18.659 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
there's just the volume of information
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
is is massive a small example would be
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
if a system is experiencing experiencing
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
an attempt
 
01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
to log in as say an administrator what
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
we call elevated privileges which you
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
really don't want right attempts that
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
are failing
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
um you you want that to be automatically
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
noticed and alerted and maybe even shut
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
down without human intervention so
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's just one example of and that's
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing we that we we do track
 
01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:52.139 align:start position:0%
but there's so much of the information
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
out there that it's hard to keep up with
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
so that's something we've we're seeing
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
in the industry in in the industries in
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
general and in other states that are are
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
modernizing their their abilities in
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
identity and access management continues
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge are you really the
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
person we think you are and is it so you
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
have this challenge between wanting it
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
to be strong but also having it to be
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
consistent and easy enough so people
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
aren't writing passwords down and
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
defeating all the systems by virtue of
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that you made them so hard so
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge there and then this
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Standards and
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
Technology we've we've embarked on over
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
the past year or so embarked on a really
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
high discipline effort to to document
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
how we exist in reference or relative to
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
these standards and then measuring
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
ourselves against them and also having
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
third-party entities coming in
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
to test us to say all right all right
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
doit how are you doing on this and and
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
so we're we're Desiring to up our game
 
01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.530 align:start position:0%
so we're we're Desiring to up our game
there

01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.790 align:start position:0%
there
uh

01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
so in the case of the uh
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
the uh desired end State we really want
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
to get better at analyzing and gathering
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
and analyzing information that we now
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
have in in and react to it more quickly
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
and and potentially in an automated
 
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.090 align:start position:0%
and and potentially in an automated
fashion

01:47:16.090 --> 01:47:16.100 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
uh and we want to um
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
have a high discipline approach to
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
application of Standards so that we're
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
able to measure ourselves and and evolve
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
with the standards as they get stronger
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:43.139 align:start position:0%
I think we think we have a question yes
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
represent Boyd please
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again thank you
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:47:51.179 --> 01:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
um

01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
China the United States India and Brazil
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
are the top four countries where cyber
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
attacks originate from everybody would
 
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
think Russia Russia is actually actually
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
10th on the list as a state
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
how much do you think we're going to be
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
spending over the next one three five
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
ten years in
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
protecting our intellectual assets here
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
at the state as it relates to potential
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
cyber attacks not just you know our
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
physical plant here up in Concord but
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
any other site that the state of New
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relies on Information
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
Technology where there could be an
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
impact it could be the way that the
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
state police communicate with each other
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management that kind of
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
perspective I'm just kind of I mean I
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
mean I have no problem with the price
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
tag because I get it it's it's it's an
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
imminent threat I mean you could come
 
01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
back here a week later and there's
 
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
something new that you're at you're
 
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
going to ask us to respond to so I think
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
for everybody here in the committee you
 
01:48:55.139 --> 01:48:56.030 align:start position:0%
for everybody here in the committee you
know

01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
what are we looking at in terms of being
 
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
able to be prepared to to address any
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
any attacks well what I can say on that
 
01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
is that the percentage of our total
 
01:49:07.739 --> 01:49:08.990 align:start position:0%
is that the percentage of our total
spend

01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh that's focused on cyber security type
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
activities keeps going up so when these
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
these Capital Appropriations help us
 
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
adapt and that's funded with capital but
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
it becomes operating expense in the next
 
01:49:23.159 --> 01:49:24.410 align:start position:0%
it becomes operating expense in the next
biennium

01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
so that you'll see that
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that if I put in a new
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
system for example to help automate
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
processes for keeping our our data
 
01:49:34.139 --> 01:49:35.950 align:start position:0%
processes for keeping our our data
secure

01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
secure
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
that will likely result in operating
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
expense in the subsequent biennium
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing and you mentioned State
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
Police so I'll use that as an example
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a standard that's
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the FBI called sieges
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
criminal justice information system and
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
see just we get audited by the FBI on a
 
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
regular basis and they look to see that
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
we're following this standard the
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
standard is really about
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
you know security of information and
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of law enforcement
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
information inside the department of
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
safety and other entities that do safety
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
related our department or law
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement related activities like
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement would be an example
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
there so in addition to our own
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
activities there are activities that the
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
federal government agencies conduct
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
that audit us and and keep raising the
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
standards bar
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
so that and that layers in cost as well
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
so you know what you what we're observed
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm observing is a a greater
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of our time and effort and
 
01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.590 align:start position:0%
percentage of our time and effort and
Investments

01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
are incrementally increasing over time
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
to adapt to this stuff
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
when you talk about foreign governments
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's and there's really two things
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
right there's the foreign governments
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned and then there's the
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
criminals and they may actually be the
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
same and they may not be the same and so
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing a lot of attempted
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
criminal activity as well that we have
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
to adapt to which is which is you know
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
either stealing money directly through
 
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.770 align:start position:0%
either stealing money directly through
um through

01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:08.780 align:start position:0%
um through
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
fooling people which we've seen examples
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
of in New Hampshire and
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
um or Ransom ransoming your data and
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
then asking for money to get it back
 
01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.390 align:start position:0%
then asking for money to get it back
additionally

01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the the state and local cyber
 
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
security grant program that was funded
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the infrastructure Bill we are now
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
accepting funds through that program in
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire was the the one of
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
the first two states to get an approved
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
plan through
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
through um through DHS cisa and so we
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
now have we just went through fiscal and
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
governor and Council we have those funds
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
in Department of Safety and we're
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
beginning to we're going to begin to
 
01:51:50.169 --> 01:51:50.179 align:start position:0%
expend those to support communities
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
around the state because you're required
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
to spend 80 percent of that money for
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
communities not State act cyber security
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
activities we're going to spend more
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
than 80 percent on the communities in
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
there we're really prioritizing that
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
money going out to the city's towns and
 
01:52:05.639 --> 01:52:06.590 align:start position:0%
money going out to the city's towns and
schools

01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
in in the state additionally we're
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
funding uh training right now in
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration with a risk pool manager
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire to train anybody who
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
wants to be trained on basic stuff like
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
how to not get fooled and give your
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
money away to a criminal things like
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
that so so we are investing in that as
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
well because it's you know it doesn't
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
help the citizens if we're just doing it
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
the state but we're not doing it all
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
around it at these very other community
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
points so we're really spending a lot of
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
effort and we're taking it very
 
01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
effort and we're taking it very
seriously

01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
one follow-up one follow-up Mr chairman
 
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick follow-up so
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
every year every year could be coming
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
back to us for well every two years
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me every two years could be
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
updating technology to to keep what
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
you're to keep what we have versus we
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
have to buy some we have to buy
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
something new every two years to to
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
continually address the threat assuming
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
like using State Police is the example
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
the FBI may decide that there's a better
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
widget that the state of New Hampshire
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
needs to have as opposed to just you
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
know installing sieges 2.0 onto onto
 
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
your um
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
onto your server
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you again
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh how close are we to finally getting
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
retired all of the Legacy 30 year old
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
hardware and software systems I know
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've I think last time you said you'd
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
started them all how close are we to
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
finishing getting all that in the rear
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
view well we're we're actually doing
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
well there I think the two the two
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
um the one remaining one that that I can
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
think of in terms of you know really old
 
01:53:59.090 --> 01:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
Hardware which you're probably aware of
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
is is in Department of Labor which which
 
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
is a running uh an as400 there which
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
they're they're they have funding to to
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
move on to new technology in our uh
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to do so so
 
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
um Revenue retired there as 400 with
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
their new Revenue system and that's been
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
very successful that that project was on
 
01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
time and on budget
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
we actually have a very large Mainframe
 
01:54:26.639 --> 01:54:27.609 align:start position:0%
we actually have a very large Mainframe
uh

01:54:27.609 --> 01:54:27.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
Ken actually does a lot of work but it's
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
it it's not it's pretty modern actually
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's an IBM Z series Mainframe that runs
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
our integrated eligibility system so
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
that that one's not we don't necessarily
 
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
look at that as a technology debt maybe
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
a strategy change if we want to get off
 
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
it off of it but it's running
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
effectively as with pretty modern
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative we'll come down here just
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
real quick Dennis uh just as an
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
eye-opener can you give them a rough
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
number of how many attempted intrusions
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
we get per week or per month
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um well a lot it continues to go up I
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the latest number but it's
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know tens of millions per
 
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know tens of millions per
month

01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and and uh well over 90 of all
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
inbound email
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
is intentionally not delivered to to
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch inboxes
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
um because of what we find in it
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you is there someone else
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newman
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
in it was October
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
um in depth New Hampshire did a story
 
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
and that's why I've got it Portsmouth
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
firm to negotiate cyber attacks for New
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in thief's native tongue all
 
01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:07.129 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in thief's native tongue all
right

01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:11.209 --> 01:56:11.219 align:start position:0%
after I saw the article I sent a message
 
01:56:15.649 --> 01:56:15.659 align:start position:0%
to a a cyber friend of mine who teaches
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
and works in the field and he's
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
um he's good anyway his his comment on
 
01:56:24.169 --> 01:56:24.179 align:start position:0%
that he didn't have a lot of
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
complementary things about that I sent
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
him the article but and this is what he
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
wrote to me it's better to establish
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
good practice and data data backup slash
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
recovery than to pay Ransom to Bad
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
actors and and he went on a little bit
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
so could I ask how confident are you on
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
backup data recovery and things like
 
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.129 align:start position:0%
backup data recovery and things like
that

01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a really that's a great
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
question oh thank you
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and I and I agree with him
 
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.930 align:start position:0%
um and I and I agree with him
wholeheartedly

01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
so so if you look at our cyber insurance
 
01:56:56.639 --> 01:56:57.950 align:start position:0%
so so if you look at our cyber insurance
program

01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
um that's part of the Cyber insurance
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
program by the way so you say okay I'm
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
gonna you know I never wanna pay a
 
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.570 align:start position:0%
gonna you know I never wanna pay a
ransom

01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
ransom
 
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:06.649 align:start position:0%
ransom
ever

01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:06.659 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
but what if I have to what if something
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
happened or somebody was more clever
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
than we were and we are faced with the
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
position of having to do so you want to
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
be able to do it effectively and that's
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
what that is about it's not about oh
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
paying a ransom is our strategy number
 
01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:22.139 align:start position:0%
one it's actually the very last thing
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'll say is that the
 
01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:28.139 align:start position:0%
ransomware actors have evolved
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so it used to be they would come and
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
they'd Ransom your data and then they'd
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
say all right give me money and I'll
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
give you the the key to get your data
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
back uh that's not what they're doing
 
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
anymore now what they're doing is
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
they're they get in they exfiltrate your
 
01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.930 align:start position:0%
they're they get in they exfiltrate your
data

01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
and then they Ransom it and so what
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you now is okay so I've got
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
backups we spend a lot of time thinking
 
01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
about our backups
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
and and typically you know we had a
 
01:57:58.850 --> 01:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
reasonable size ransomware attack in
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
2016 that we successfully uh mitigated
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
through putting the data back from
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
backups now you you're in the Specter of
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
accepting a data breach
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
if you if you tell the ransomware the
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
the person who's ransomed you to go away
 
01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.370 align:start position:0%
the person who's ransomed you to go away
so

01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:18.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
on any given situation you know we're
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
going to try as hard as we can not to be
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
Ransom we've done a lot of work to to
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
see that we don't
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
um if we were to be Ransom we'd have to
 
01:58:31.729 --> 01:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
look at that situation and say all right
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do here I've got
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
backups do we want to accept a data
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
breach or potential data breach because
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's what they're gonna the bad guys
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
are going to say all right well I know
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
you got a backup but I'm going to put
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
your info on the dark web if you don't
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
pay me
 
01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.330 align:start position:0%
pay me
so

01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so we might you know we we'd be faced
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
then with a policy decision on how we'd
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
want to go forward on that so it's it's
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
a complex Pro uh process but the one of
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
the things and one of the reasons why
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
native speakers are important is
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be good communication
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
but also the attitudes it's there's
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
documented evidence that shows that the
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
attitudes of the criminals are much
 
01:59:15.649 --> 01:59:15.659 align:start position:0%
better disposed towards the people
 
01:59:17.209 --> 01:59:17.219 align:start position:0%
they've ransomed and are much more
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
willing to negotiate
 
01:59:25.729 --> 01:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I have one more question
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
so I I know
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
um arpa funds and I believe there were
 
01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:36.860 align:start position:0%
monies available
 
01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh maybe this is just for cities and
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
maybe it was for the state on protection
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
of water water water and sewer systems
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal and I'm sure we have some in
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
did we receive any of that money for the
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
state or did that all go to towns and is
 
01:59:59.209 --> 01:59:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's not a capital request was
 
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
was there a lot of money that came in
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
that has been accessed yes
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
um very good question it isn't it isn't
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily in my wheelhouse but I know
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh Bob Scott at DES and his team are
 
02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
working on that as is our uh our risk
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
pool manager for the state in
 
02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
collaboration to you know get
 
02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
assessments of these water systems and
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
these other critical infrastructure
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
systems like you know Dam controllers
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
and things like that and and then teach
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
those folks how to mitigate them and
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
keep them secure going forward so that
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
there is a ton of activity going on in
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
that space and there's money being spent
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
that I believe is Arbor money that
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
flowed through Des okay thank you anyone
 
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
else yes Mike
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr chairman uh the
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
first question is about the data breach
 
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
if somebody is going to take in your
 
02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
data would you trust them not to you're
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to pay them an interest that
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
they're not going to release it to
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
everybody anyway
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
I couldn't I personally would not okay
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
very if I have yes please and a
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up is uh I just want to mention I
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
I like the way you summarized uh your
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
sheet that shows the amounts for the
 
02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:21.589 align:start position:0%
sheet that shows the amounts for the
different

02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
entities that you deal with I think that
 
02:01:25.930 --> 02:01:25.940 align:start position:0%
makes houses ask a lot less questions
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
and uh when you give this stuff up front
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
I think now I can safely say thank you
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for coming all right it's two
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
more projects but they're pretty
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
self-explainable so I'm happy to leave
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
it up leave that or if you'd like me to
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
quickly explain them I know we're
 
02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
probably out of time so
 
02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:49.250 align:start position:0%
probably out of time so
um

02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's uh yeah go right ahead
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right so the two others are really
 
02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh it's um
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh to really we doit manages a lot of
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
Finance we charge back to the agencies
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
to to fund all of our activities and and
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
that system's pretty old complex and
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
inefficient to run and it's not very
 
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
transparent to the agencies and to
 
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
yourselves and see rep eating nodding
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
because we've been talking about this
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
for years so this is a request for us to
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
improve our own capabilities and and how
 
02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
we operate internally from a financial
 
02:02:25.619 --> 02:02:27.530 align:start position:0%
we operate internally from a financial
perspective

02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and and really reduce the manual
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
effort that we spend and then the last
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
thing is is really around effectiveness
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
of using the staff all of our staff all
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
day long are running around helping
 
02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:39.169 align:start position:0%
day long are running around helping
people

02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
keep the the business of the State
 
02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.530 align:start position:0%
keep the the business of the State
running

02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
running
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
this is about making that more effective
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and being able to measure it better so
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
that we can adjust ourselves if we're
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
doing badly in a particular place or if

03:00:24.650 --> 03:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
what I was told in preparation for the
 
03:00:26.330 --> 03:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
meeting is talk a little bit about about
 
03:00:29.330 --> 03:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh both the process and how we get here
 
03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
and our role in the ongoing process and
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
then in addition to that the
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
meat of the matter which is not very
 
03:00:39.530 --> 03:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
many slides but is um uh what we what we
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
got what we're asking for Etc in the
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
budget process I I want to start and I
 
03:00:46.969 --> 03:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
thought about this a little bit is
 
03:00:46.979 --> 03:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
thought about this a little bit is
um

03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know we have very few opportunities
 
03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
we have some opportunities not that many
 
03:00:53.870 --> 03:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities to kind of talk about how
 
03:00:55.610 --> 03:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
the process works and some of you are
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
very very very familiar with it and
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
other people are very familiar with
 
03:01:01.730 --> 03:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
pieces of the process and how the
 
03:01:03.230 --> 03:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
components work what does the governor's
 
03:01:04.610 --> 03:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
office actually doing what are you guys
 
03:01:06.769 --> 03:01:06.779 align:start position:0%
doing and why do you have a why do you
 
03:01:09.530 --> 03:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
have a hearing in June of a of an
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
election year when you don't even know
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be elected and what's
 
03:01:13.730 --> 03:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
going on at that and what are the
 
03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
documents and that and you know what's
 
03:01:16.730 --> 03:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
in that binder and what's in the other
 
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
binder that's on your desk in front of
 
03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
you and what are all of those things so
 
03:01:22.490 --> 03:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
what what I want to do is summarize a
 
03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
um about what the process is but before
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
that Karen's going to explain to you who
 
03:01:29.690 --> 03:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
03:01:32.210 --> 03:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
Services is and what our role is in
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
terms of managing
 
03:01:36.410 --> 03:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the infrastructure of the state
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
government of New Hampshire
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm the part of Das that's like
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
every other agency right we have some
 
03:01:45.889 --> 03:01:45.899 align:start position:0%
facilities and we're coming to you to
 
03:01:49.610 --> 03:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
request some capital budget projects so
 
03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
the division of planned property
 
03:01:52.550 --> 03:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
maintains and operates 91 buildings
 
03:01:53.929 --> 03:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire so that's
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
Office Buildings a lot of which are here
 
03:01:58.010 --> 03:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
in Concord all the courthouses
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and what we don't
 
03:02:03.050 --> 03:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
operate and maintain are residential or
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
institutional properties so you'll hear
 
03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
from other agencies such as the Veterans
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
Home Health and Human Services that
 
03:02:10.929 --> 03:02:10.939 align:start position:0%
operate those facilities
 
03:02:13.849 --> 03:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
my division has over 200 staff we cover
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
things from janitorial so the cleaning
 
03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
of the facilities maintenance we have a
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
small security team that makes sure
 
03:02:21.469 --> 03:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
things don't happen on the weekends when
 
03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
no one's here grounds crew we have some
 
03:02:25.790 --> 03:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
skilled trades people Carpenters
 
03:02:28.610 --> 03:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
electricians plumbers and we have some
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
office staff that kind of manage the
 
03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
office side of the business so with a
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
combination of our in-house staff and
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
contracted Services it's our goal to
 
03:02:39.590 --> 03:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
provide safe efficient and accessible
 
03:02:41.450 --> 03:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
space for state employees and the public
 
03:02:43.610 --> 03:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
that come into our buildings
 
03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:44.769 align:start position:0%
that come into our buildings
foreign

03:02:44.769 --> 03:02:44.779 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:02:48.110 --> 03:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
and then Ted's division is Public Works
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
not to be confused with house Public
 
03:02:52.849 --> 03:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
Works which is a which is a mistake I
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
have to make somebody said I'm going
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
over to Public Works and I thought they
 
03:02:56.690 --> 03:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
were driving up to Hayes and drive to
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
see Ted and they were actually coming
 
03:02:59.570 --> 03:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
over here but Ted will talk to you a
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about what the division of
 
03:03:03.170 --> 03:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
Public Works is
 
03:03:05.210 --> 03:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the division of Public
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
Works is essentially a full service
 
03:03:10.929 --> 03:03:10.939 align:start position:0%
engineering and Architectural office
 
03:03:13.490 --> 03:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
that provides design and construction
 
03:03:16.730 --> 03:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
services for building owners and
 
03:03:20.769 --> 03:03:20.779 align:start position:0%
building managers uh that take care of
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
state-owned buildings so we either build
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
new buildings for the state or we
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
maintain the ones that the state already
 
03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:29.929 align:start position:0%
maintain the ones that the state already
owns

03:03:29.929 --> 03:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
owns
 
03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
um my staff is comprised of Engineers
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
and architects
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
many of them licensed
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we service All State agencies and
 
03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
building managers except the university
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
system in the community college system
 
03:03:47.330 --> 03:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
there they take care of their own
 
03:03:49.550 --> 03:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
buildings on their own
 
03:03:52.389 --> 03:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and by law
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
any project that's over twenty five
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is required to go
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
through DPW to provide consistency in
 
03:04:04.250 --> 03:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
the design in the construction of the
 
03:04:07.910 --> 03:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
buildings and to provide a longevity to
 
03:04:09.290 --> 03:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
those buildings
 
03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:12.370 align:start position:0%
those buildings
foreign

03:04:12.370 --> 03:04:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'll point out that both uh both Ted and
 
03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
Karen are licensed Professional
 
03:04:16.500 --> 03:04:18.050 align:start position:0%
Karen are licensed Professional
Engineers

03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
Engineers
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
um uh I am not I'm here mostly as um
 
03:04:24.050 --> 03:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
eye candy I think
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the um or something like that the um
 
03:04:29.929 --> 03:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
I'm here to so I want to talk about the
 
03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
the process your slide three of your
 
03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
slides is a uh is a overview think of it
 
03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
as a table of contents of the process
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
and how we start from if you're managing
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
buildings how you get from managing
 
03:04:46.030 --> 03:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
buildings to a capital project
 
03:04:48.170 --> 03:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
appropriated and funded this is not
 
03:04:50.990 --> 03:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
about normal operations you know fixing
 
03:04:53.210 --> 03:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
carpeting or or you know standard
 
03:04:55.490 --> 03:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
ongoing work and we're going to start
 
03:04:56.809 --> 03:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
Karen's going to talk a little bit from
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
an agency perspective about things like
 
03:05:00.769 --> 03:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
facility assessments and then how you
 
03:05:02.809 --> 03:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
start the capital budget process then
 
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna talk a little
 
03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
bit about the the form 1as and the big
 
03:05:07.969 --> 03:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
binder and the hearings and then the
 
03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation and the levels of cost
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
estimation that occur throughout the
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
process I want to highlight that for you
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
we regularly hear about how much a
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
project is likely to cost and the
 
03:05:24.250 --> 03:05:24.260 align:start position:0%
reliability of that number
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
ranges from sketchy to pretty good
 
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
depending on when in the process
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about that because at
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
some very early stage in the process
 
03:05:34.370 --> 03:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's somebody saying to themselves you
 
03:05:36.590 --> 03:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to completely do do
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
this over I think it's going to cost
 
03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
something like four million dollars
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not a reliable number four
 
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
million is it's usually an educated
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
estimate but it's not that reliable
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
later in the process after you know
 
03:05:51.769 --> 03:05:51.779 align:start position:0%
after Ted's team has gotten through with
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
it and you know Ted will be at all of
 
03:05:54.769 --> 03:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
your hearings at some point with giant
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
binders full of information and
 
03:05:56.160 --> 03:05:57.349 align:start position:0%
binders full of information and
estimates

03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
03:05:59.210 --> 03:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
um for you to rely on but I'm going to
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
start with from Karen's standpoint uh
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
managing facilities and where we start
 
03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
in that process so if you're on slide
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
four I'll note the only slide with
 
03:06:12.290 --> 03:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
graphic cartoons on it which is very
 
03:06:12.300 --> 03:06:14.090 align:start position:0%
graphic cartoons on it which is very
exciting

03:06:14.090 --> 03:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay so as an agency each year we make
 
03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
sure that we we have eyes on every
 
03:06:21.769 --> 03:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
single one of our buildings so my staff
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
goes around and does a full inventory of
 
03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
the condition of every system in the
 
03:06:29.210 --> 03:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
building so it's HVAC it's paint it's
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
um boilers it's elevator anything that's
 
03:06:33.050 --> 03:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
in the building we get a condition
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
assessment on those and we um summarize
 
03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:37.429 align:start position:0%
assessment on those and we um summarize
those

03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so again you'll see a list of kind of
 
03:06:40.849 --> 03:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
some examples we look at building
 
03:06:42.889 --> 03:06:42.899 align:start position:0%
envelope we look at the roof the windows
 
03:06:45.290 --> 03:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
any life safety components whether the
 
03:06:47.170 --> 03:06:47.180 align:start position:0%
generator is operational
 
03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
ground so parking lots a lot of times we
 
03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
have you know cracks that develop and
 
03:06:53.330 --> 03:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
those become safety issues so all these
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
little things get tabulated into our
 
03:06:58.730 --> 03:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and then moving on to slide five what
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
we do with those assessments only uh
 
03:07:04.010 --> 03:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
every other year when we're building the
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget is we
 
03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
capital budget is we
um

03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
we come up with a list of prioritized
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
projects things that need to be done and
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
things that are
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
um that urgently need to be done
 
03:07:14.750 --> 03:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and then as as commissioner
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
erlinghaus alluded to we've used the
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
term very rough guesstimate so we come
 
03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
up with a kind of a ballpark number
 
03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
where we think that that that project's
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to come in for cost and then
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the the 91 facilities that
 
03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for we look at those
 
03:07:31.610 --> 03:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
and we prioritize the project so we
 
03:07:33.710 --> 03:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
might come to you know originally with a
 
03:07:35.450 --> 03:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
list of 40 Projects which eventually
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
gets whittled down to what ends up in
 
03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and that's kind of
 
03:07:42.490 --> 03:07:42.500 align:start position:0%
how Das as an agency approaches
 
03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
collecting the data on the facilities
 
03:07:46.130 --> 03:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
and then coming up with a list of
 
03:07:47.809 --> 03:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
prioritized capital projects that we
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
would like to do
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
so talk about the money I'm going to
 
03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
mention my my bucket analogy here
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
because I am addicted to it
 
03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:58.910 align:start position:0%
because I am addicted to it
um

03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
we came forward with a list once
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
actually fairly early in my tenure and
 
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:03.590 align:start position:0%
actually fairly early in my tenure and
and

03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:04.190 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:05.690 --> 03:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
Steve Lorenson who was Karen's
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
predecessor I didn't mean it was Steve
 
03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
and Karen and we were talking about
 
03:08:11.330 --> 03:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
buckets and he said well he said these
 
03:08:13.309 --> 03:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
are our 12 bucket projects and I said
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry but I'm an idiot I don't
 
03:08:19.849 --> 03:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
know what that means and he said oh so
 
03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's the 12 buckets not the six buckets
 
03:08:23.210 --> 03:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
and let me give an example of what that
 
03:08:26.030 --> 03:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
means when a roof is leaking
 
03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
and there are 12 places or desks that we
 
03:08:31.010 --> 03:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
put buckets to catch what leaks out of
 
03:08:32.330 --> 03:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
them so it doesn't drip onto the
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
computer we call that a 12 bucket
 
03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:35.570 align:start position:0%
computer we call that a 12 bucket
project

03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
and when there's only six it's a six
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
bucket project and I thought geez I
 
03:08:42.050 --> 03:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
should have been able to figure that out
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
um but what we typically repair at the
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
state level realistically are the 12
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
bucket projects we we uh sixes become
 
03:08:53.630 --> 03:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
twelves eventually but we're often not
 
03:08:55.730 --> 03:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
able to get to them at the at the three
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
four five six bucket and when they get
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
over that so part of that priority is
 
03:09:01.969 --> 03:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
you know so what are we gonna what are
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
we gonna do with form 1A for what are we
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
going to start the process for we're
 
03:09:07.130 --> 03:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
going to put on our list for this
 
03:09:10.130 --> 03:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
biennium versus next biennium so let me
 
03:09:12.170 --> 03:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
let Karen talk a little bit about what a
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
form 1A is and there's actually a
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
picture of one which is a nice touch
 
03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:17.690 align:start position:0%
picture of one which is a nice touch
sure

03:09:17.690 --> 03:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:09:19.969 --> 03:09:19.979 align:start position:0%
um so form 1A is the form that every
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
agency will use to put their the details
 
03:09:24.110 --> 03:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
down about the capital projects that
 
03:09:25.849 --> 03:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
they're interested in doing
 
03:09:28.130 --> 03:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so again it's a way to prioritize so
 
03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
you do a form 1A for each project and
 
03:09:31.969 --> 03:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
then you put them in a ranked order
 
03:09:33.650 --> 03:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
According to which your highest priority
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
project is gives some very general
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
information about the agency on the
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
location for where the project is to be
 
03:09:43.250 --> 03:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
done again we put that very rough
 
03:09:45.889 --> 03:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
guesstimate number so that's my staff
 
03:09:47.570 --> 03:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at it and say oh we did
 
03:09:49.250 --> 03:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
a roof last year and it was about this
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
many square feet so we think it's going
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
to be about this many hundreds of
 
03:09:54.050 --> 03:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars so it's there's not
 
03:09:56.990 --> 03:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of s like professional
 
03:09:58.849 --> 03:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
estimating done at that point it's more
 
03:10:00.910 --> 03:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
just what we think it's going to cost
 
03:10:02.990 --> 03:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
and then a brief description of the
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
project which is really important
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
because if we're doing a roof then it
 
03:10:07.730 --> 03:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
might be that we're doing the roof but
 
03:10:09.230 --> 03:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
we also need to repair like the trim
 
03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
that's associated with the roof or
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe there's asbestos that
 
03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed as we repair the
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
roof so making sure that we get get that
 
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
level of detail into that description as
 
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
well and then
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
again has information on how to get in
 
03:10:27.290 --> 03:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
touch with the person that developed the
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
form 1A so that if anyone had questions
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
on that then that information is
 
03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
on that then that information is
available

03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:34.130 align:start position:0%
available
um

03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
on the next go ahead slide slide number
 
03:10:40.010 --> 03:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
seven is is just a a screenshot of an
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
example of one of those forms so you can
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind of see what I'm talking about
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
um but what gets submitted is
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
essentially a packet full of these forms
 
03:10:49.730 --> 03:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
one for each project that we're that
 
03:10:52.610 --> 03:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're putting forth for consideration so
 
03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.460 --> 03:10:58.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:10:58.010 --> 03:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
everybody needs a problem
 
03:11:00.479 --> 03:11:02.290 align:start position:0%
everybody needs a problem
um

03:11:02.290 --> 03:11:02.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:04.849 --> 03:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
oh that's terrible
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
um so so at this stage of the process so
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing this around the state
 
03:11:10.969 --> 03:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
we do a lot
 
03:11:12.650 --> 03:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
um Karen does a ton of them but so do a
 
03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
lot of other agencies this is all of
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
them this binder gets developed it
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually gets developed in in my office
 
03:11:20.690 --> 03:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
technically these forms are well these
 
03:11:23.090 --> 03:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
forms are are for the governor
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically they're submitted to us we
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
can buy on them there are binders and
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
this is this is the thing that is the
 
03:11:32.570 --> 03:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
beginning of the capital budget hearing
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
process and so now typically
 
03:11:37.969 --> 03:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
I don't think Public Works is often
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
using this book because this is an early
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
stage of the process I think you're
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
typically using using a later stage
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to in a minute
 
03:11:45.479 --> 03:11:47.150 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to in a minute
but

03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
um this is the guidebook for the
 
03:11:50.030 --> 03:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget hearing so the
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget hearings are
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
in June or July and and we go from that
 
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's a governor housing center reps
 
03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
Etc are on that committee we go through
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
all the projects in theory everybody
 
03:12:00.769 --> 03:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to make a pitch Ted is on
 
03:12:02.090 --> 03:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
the commission I'm on the on the
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee and so is the oit what happens
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
after that
 
03:12:06.359 --> 03:12:07.309 align:start position:0%
after that
um

03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
typically what happens is well I'm going
 
03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
to let Ted talk about the prioritization
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
we go through typically the governor's
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
office will say take this and prioritize
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
it and this is what's happening that
 
03:12:19.969 --> 03:12:19.979 align:start position:0%
you're not not seeing and not
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of behind the scenes
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.889 --> 03:12:29.899 align:start position:0%
so um I'd like to point out that form
 
03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
1as are typically
 
03:12:36.590 --> 03:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh for deferred maintenance projects on
 
03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:38.210 align:start position:0%
uh for deferred maintenance projects on
buildings

03:12:38.210 --> 03:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
um lately the the last few rounds
 
03:12:43.610 --> 03:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
um there have been some I.T projects
 
03:12:45.230 --> 03:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
that have been requested and that's
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
seemed to become a norm
 
03:12:48.359 --> 03:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
seemed to become a norm
um

03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Deferred maintenance in the state on
 
03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
the buildings is enormous
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the total of that
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
binder might be six or seven hundred
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of requests
 
03:13:03.960 --> 03:13:05.570 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of requests
and

03:13:05.570 --> 03:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:05.580 --> 03:13:06.650 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
and usually the capital budget is about
 
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
120 125 million so we're taking a chip
 
03:13:16.730 --> 03:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
at the worst we're doing the 12 bucket
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
projects not the six bucket projects
 
03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:21.889 align:start position:0%
projects not the six bucket projects
right

03:13:21.889 --> 03:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:13:21.899 --> 03:13:23.570 align:start position:0%
right
and

03:13:23.570 --> 03:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:24.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
and we go through a prioritization
 
03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:28.730 align:start position:0%
and we go through a prioritization
process

03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
so often but not always
 
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the governor's office asks Das to
 
03:13:39.170 --> 03:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
create a three-tier priority list for
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
them and uh and we go through Charlie
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
myself and the
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
um assistant director for Public Works
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
goes through all the requests and
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
evaluates them with that
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
severity uh in mind you know how severe
 
03:14:02.090 --> 03:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
are the are the projects that are being
 
03:14:04.429 --> 03:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
requested and we put them into three
 
03:14:04.439 --> 03:14:06.349 align:start position:0%
requested and we put them into three
tiers

03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
tiers
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah a high priority a medium
 
03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
priority and a lower priority
 
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
and um and we compile that list and we
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
turn that back over to the governor's
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
office for his consideration uh we're
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
not experts on I.T so uh doit does the
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
same thing for all the doit requests and
 
03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
provides that list to the governor's
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
office as well
 
03:14:38.510 --> 03:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
so so the meat of it to get to you is
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the is uh what happens when when the
 
03:14:42.530 --> 03:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
governor looks at his list I mean
 
03:14:44.210 --> 03:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
frankly what happens is you know we give
 
03:14:45.410 --> 03:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
them back this list and governors
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
typically have said something like do
 
03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
all the A's and B's or something like
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
that it's typically about 100 projects
 
03:14:53.210 --> 03:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
and what they mean by do them
 
03:14:55.849 --> 03:14:55.859 align:start position:0%
is I want you to take the form 1A I want
 
03:14:57.530 --> 03:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
you to look at it I want you to have a
 
03:14:59.809 --> 03:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
one of your engineers or Architects and
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
they're typically assigned with that
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
with something in mind about well he did
 
03:15:06.889 --> 03:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
the women's prison let's give him this
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and they do a much more detailed cost
 
03:15:12.889 --> 03:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
estimate this is the process by which we
 
03:15:14.929 --> 03:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
developed the blue book that is that is
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
in front of you it's typically about a
 
03:15:19.130 --> 03:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
hundred projects it's typically sent in
 
03:15:22.370 --> 03:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
September to um to DPW for cost
 
03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
estimating and that process comes back
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
in about well talk about how it goes
 
03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
my estimates so
 
03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
my estimates so
um

03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:35.330 --> 03:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have this list from the governor's
 
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
office where he's asked us to provide an
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
estimate for all of the selected
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
projects that that he's Chosen and uh
 
03:15:47.809 --> 03:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
each project manager so uh you know in
 
03:15:50.090 --> 03:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
our office our office is filled with
 
03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
Architects and engineers and there are
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as project managers
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
or construction administrators so each
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the project managers is assigned 7 to
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
10 of the form 1as the requests
 
03:16:09.530 --> 03:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
and they take those form 1as and contact
 
03:16:11.929 --> 03:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
the individual that's at the bottom of
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
the form 1A
 
03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
and ask for a meeting
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the meeting is to
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
fully understand what the project is
 
03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
um the division of Public Works knows
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
buildings oftentimes
 
03:16:31.969 --> 03:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
um build building owners or agencies
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
that use their buildings for some
 
03:16:34.439 --> 03:16:35.870 align:start position:0%
that use their buildings for some
purpose

03:16:35.870 --> 03:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
don't really understand how buildings
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
are put together so it's important for
 
03:16:43.210 --> 03:16:43.220 align:start position:0%
us to interview them and understand
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what they want to try to
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
accomplish with their form 1A
 
03:16:52.250 --> 03:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
um a scope of work is developed based on
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
that interview
 
03:16:56.750 --> 03:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
and then the project manager comes back
 
03:17:00.170 --> 03:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
to the office and goes through archive
 
03:17:00.180 --> 03:17:02.210 align:start position:0%
to the office and goes through archive
plans

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
plans
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
um perhaps goes out to the site and
 
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
measures the building for the project
 
03:17:10.969 --> 03:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
that they want to do in every case each
 
03:17:13.730 --> 03:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
project is physically inspected by the
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
project manager then the project manager
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
comes back and using several different
 
03:17:23.809 --> 03:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
resources provides an estimate for how
 
03:17:26.570 --> 03:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
much that project is going to cost
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
and that estimate includes uh you know
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
profit and overhead for the contractor
 
03:17:35.570 --> 03:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
architectural fees that might be
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
associated with the project
 
03:17:42.170 --> 03:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
um uh inflation because
 
03:17:45.650 --> 03:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
we're taking a a con a conceptual
 
03:17:45.660 --> 03:17:47.210 align:start position:0%
we're taking a a con a conceptual
project

03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be built for maybe
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
three years and we're estimating it
 
03:17:56.510 --> 03:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
today so
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
in this example we'd be estimating it in
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
twenty twenty three dollars but the
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
project might not be built until 2026 so
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
we apply an inflation factor to all of
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
our estimates to bring it to the last
 
03:18:13.610 --> 03:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
year or the biennium that we hope the
 
03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
construction might occur
 
03:18:18.830 --> 03:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
and we go through these you know there's
 
03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
typically about a hundred projects and
 
03:18:24.590 --> 03:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh and when the project managers have
 
03:18:26.990 --> 03:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
completed their estimates they're
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
submitted to myself and Michelle
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
Giuliano the assistant uh director for
 
03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
public works and we review each of the
 
03:18:35.939 --> 03:18:37.429 align:start position:0%
public works and we review each of the
estimates

03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes returning them back to the
 
03:18:41.929 --> 03:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
project managers with questions that we
 
03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
have about how they arrived at that
 
03:18:44.279 --> 03:18:45.290 align:start position:0%
have about how they arrived at that
number

03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
and then finally we take a look at the
 
03:18:51.530 --> 03:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
project description that's provided on
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the form 1A and compare that to the
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
notes that the project managers have
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
taken about the scope of work for the
 
03:18:59.279 --> 03:19:00.290 align:start position:0%
taken about the scope of work for the
project

03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:19:03.889 --> 03:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
and we create a narrative that you all
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
see in the blue book that's in front of
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
you now
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the narrative is an important part
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this process because when the project
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
um actually receives an appropriation
 
03:19:21.110 --> 03:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the using agency brings it to us to
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
go to design and construction
 
03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are some cases where the using
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
agency might say
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah and you know what while we're at
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
it we want to fix the elevator
 
03:19:36.170 --> 03:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
but the narrative is only describing a
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
roofing project
 
03:19:40.250 --> 03:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
and it's in the narrative is important
 
03:19:42.290 --> 03:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
because the appropriation is
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
specifically for that description
 
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
and we have to evaluate what the using
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
agency wants to do with the money
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the description and
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to tell them well you
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
can't do your elevator with this
 
03:20:00.370 --> 03:20:00.380 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's only for the roof
 
03:20:03.889 --> 03:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
and and these are all completed sometime
 
03:20:06.050 --> 03:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
around the end of November
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
so that's so that's this book and Ted
 
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
will explain to you and I know this is
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
remedial for some of you but there's
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
some points I want to want to hit in the
 
03:20:15.889 --> 03:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
process the narrative in this book is
 
03:20:17.090 --> 03:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
not just a couple of words somebody
 
03:20:18.590 --> 03:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
jotted down on a piece of paper and
 
03:20:20.750 --> 03:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's the point that uh their agencies
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
routinely and we're often that agency
 
03:20:24.769 --> 03:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
who want to do something else with the
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
money because you're looking and you're
 
03:20:28.010 --> 03:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
going you know what it turns out can we
 
03:20:30.969 --> 03:20:30.979 align:start position:0%
also do this this came in under bid well
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
underestimate that's actually not common
 
03:20:32.760 --> 03:20:34.190 align:start position:0%
underestimate that's actually not common
lately

03:20:34.190 --> 03:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
lately
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh we want to do that and I think
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that both the LBA the legislature
 
03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
that that both the LBA the legislature
broadly

03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
03:20:43.610 --> 03:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and and we look at this to say this
 
03:20:46.370 --> 03:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the appropriation if if
 
03:20:49.130 --> 03:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's within the narrative here this is
 
03:20:51.170 --> 03:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
what we're using it's not the title it's
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
not the words on the page it's it's the
 
03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
intent and we regard this as the intent
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
unless there's some evidence that in the
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
committee deliberations the committee
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
said yeah do that but also you do don't
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
just do perimeter security and fence
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
detection like throw in the sewer with
 
03:21:08.090 --> 03:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
with that as well in which case we would
 
03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
allow that otherwise they have to get
 
03:21:11.690 --> 03:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
new legislation or go through all sorts
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
of machinations so so that's this and I
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
only say that to say somebody said to me
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
once well they're limited to this and
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
what can go in the capital budget right
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I and and what I said is uh first of
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
all I'm not about to tell the
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
legislature they're limited to anything
 
03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
but secondly no they can do anything
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
they want stuff can come up later or
 
03:21:31.929 --> 03:21:31.939 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
03:21:31.939 --> 03:21:33.650 align:start position:0%
everything else
traditionally

03:21:33.650 --> 03:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
03:21:36.769 --> 03:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
this is where 98 of the capital budget
 
03:21:39.230 --> 03:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
comes from but it doesn't have to it
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
just happens to be the stuff where we
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
have better estimates more detailed work
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
there are other things those estimates
 
03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
are going to be a little dice here oh
 
03:21:49.010 --> 03:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
and that's that book is used by the
 
03:21:51.170 --> 03:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
governor's office to produce this
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
which is in green again this year
 
03:21:55.969 --> 03:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
um I guess they like green
 
03:21:58.010 --> 03:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
um but and then that traditionally is
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
introduced as you know is House Bill 25.
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
although I suppose not always I'm sure
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
there's a year it wasn't but I don't
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
know when that was
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
um in the legislative phase what did we
 
03:22:08.809 --> 03:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
do to help you well first of all we will
 
03:22:10.730 --> 03:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
do anything you want at any time in the
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
process we're happy to that's what we're
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
we exist as a resource but for the most
 
03:22:17.690 --> 03:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
part Ted is here and Ted is meant to be
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
here hanging out with giant canvas bags
 
03:22:22.849 --> 03:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
full of estimates because this isn't an
 
03:22:24.769 --> 03:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
estimate this isn't the estimate they
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
did There's you know two to six pages
 
03:22:30.170 --> 03:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
worth of actual going through and and
 
03:22:32.929 --> 03:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
calculating things and he's there as a
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
resource in case you in case you want to
 
03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
go well what's with the acquire building
 
03:22:39.290 --> 03:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
a 25 Hall Street what does that include
 
03:22:40.969 --> 03:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
and what did you look at and what did
 
03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
you include in that and he's there so
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
he's meant to be there for you
 
03:22:47.690 --> 03:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's the process and I'm gonna put a
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
pin in that unless anybody wants to ask
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
a question about that
 
03:22:59.530 --> 03:22:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
yes I've been just wondering in terms of
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with these estimates
 
03:23:07.969 --> 03:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
um granted inflation has been going on
 
03:23:11.690 --> 03:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
but with what is the covid situation how
 
03:23:14.330 --> 03:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
does it that affect the estimate well
 
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
the the the you know supply chain issues
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
and and related issues I mean there are
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
a bunch of things that are affecting
 
03:23:22.190 --> 03:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
what we're paying for stuff right now
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
and our our estimates are meant to be
 
03:23:26.210 --> 03:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
derived from what what's actually
 
03:23:27.889 --> 03:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
happening out in the field you know we
 
03:23:29.570 --> 03:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
know from bids that come in on a regular
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
basis what's going on with cost of
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
materials what's going on with cost of
 
03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
Labor I would say the things that that
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
drive you know timing is an issue with
 
03:23:40.490 --> 03:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
the ability to get major pieces of
 
03:23:40.500 --> 03:23:42.349 align:start position:0%
the ability to get major pieces of
equipment

03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:23:44.570 --> 03:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
um labor shortages is an issue and
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's particularly true on things like
 
03:23:48.050 --> 03:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
second shift
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
um if you're doing second shift work
 
03:23:50.990 --> 03:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's harder to get second shift workers
 
03:23:52.969 --> 03:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
people tend people tend to have enough
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
enough trouble getting first shift
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
workers so these things all factor in
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're meant to be doing
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is to look at our
 
03:24:04.849 --> 03:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
experience in estimates it's easy to say
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know it should cost about 400 a
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
square foot to to build a that might be
 
03:24:10.610 --> 03:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
the wrong number to build a new building
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's another thing to say yeah but the
 
03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
last time we built in built a new
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
building which actually doesn't happen a
 
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
lot but it cost like 550 a square foot
 
03:24:21.530 --> 03:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
because of this this and this and so
 
03:24:24.290 --> 03:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
we're constantly updating that and and I
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
estimating construction is a really I
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to say it's a crap shoot but
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on in that if you
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
get a lot of bids and a lot of people
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
know they're bidding we get lower prices
 
03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
if some company knows he's the only guy
 
03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
if some company knows he's the only guy
bidding

03:24:41.570 --> 03:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
bidding
 
03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to get that great a
 
03:24:44.450 --> 03:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
deal and if it happens to be something
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's particularly complicated that
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do or is in a
 
03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do or is in a
particularly

03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
difficult location
 
03:24:53.570 --> 03:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
that affects those things as well
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot that goes into it
 
03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:57.349 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot that goes into it
unfortunately

03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:24:58.809 --> 03:24:58.819 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
so the estimates that we've been talking
 
03:25:04.190 --> 03:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
about this morning to you
 
03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:04.729 align:start position:0%
about this morning to you
um

03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:10.250 --> 03:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
are are the best shot today at what we
 
03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
think the construction might be about
 
03:25:15.170 --> 03:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
three years from now and that's what
 
03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
goes in the blue book and that's for the
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of an appropriation
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
when the using agency brings a project
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
to us
 
03:25:26.929 --> 03:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
and we begin the design phase at several
 
03:25:29.210 --> 03:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
points in the design phase we actually
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
have our consultant prepare an estimate
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that we know two things one
 
03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
um are are we designing something that
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
we can afford you know via the
 
03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the other is
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
um to alert us to the fact that yes
 
03:25:50.690 --> 03:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're designing what we're supposed to
 
03:25:53.150 --> 03:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's going to cost us
 
03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:54.290 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's going to cost us
more

03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:25:54.300 --> 03:25:55.910 align:start position:0%
more
so

03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
um in most cases when we go to bid with
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
our projects
 
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
we will not go to bid if the estimate
 
03:26:07.610 --> 03:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
that we have is severely over the
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's that's been
 
03:26:13.969 --> 03:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.769 --> 03:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
that can be a big issue and it's
 
03:26:17.809 --> 03:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's a lot of that
 
03:26:17.819 --> 03:26:18.769 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's a lot of that
um

03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:20.929 --> 03:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
in the absence of other questions which
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you
 
03:26:32.929 --> 03:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
um just out of curiosity uh
 
03:26:35.450 --> 03:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
you have a project that starts at a six
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
bucket and we know that's going to be
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
put on hold
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
for a while then it finally elevates
 
03:26:45.050 --> 03:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
itself to a 12 bucket which might mean
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
it might get on to the list
 
03:26:51.769 --> 03:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
and then three years from now
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
that 12 bucket project
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
is probably a 18 to 24 bucket project
 
03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:01.250 align:start position:0%
is probably a 18 to 24 bucket project
yeah

03:27:01.250 --> 03:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
which now quadruples the price of that
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
project if my educated guess would be
 
03:27:10.319 --> 03:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
project if my educated guess would be
well

03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:27:11.760 --> 03:27:13.790 align:start position:0%
well
yeah

03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:15.290 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

03:27:15.290 --> 03:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:17.690 --> 03:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's the the giant
 
03:27:19.190 --> 03:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
challenge with
 
03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:20.150 align:start position:0%
challenge with
um

03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
with maintenance the state has a very
 
03:27:24.410 --> 03:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
large and complex system of buildings
 
03:27:27.530 --> 03:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
and whatnot related to it that are in
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
varying degrees of repair
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
um they're not new there's a lot of work
 
03:27:35.210 --> 03:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done we did a deferred
 
03:27:36.650 --> 03:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
maintenance at some point during one of
 
03:27:38.450 --> 03:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
the arpa things somebody in the in the
 
03:27:40.010 --> 03:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislature came and said can you do a
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance list for us and I
 
03:27:43.490 --> 03:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
worked with Karen on something and
 
03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
worked with Karen I called Karen and
 
03:27:46.250 --> 03:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
said can you do it deferred maintenance
 
03:27:49.010 --> 03:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
list that's how I worked with her but um
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
she's doing a list and said what how
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
deep do you want to go
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I said do something that's about 250
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
million because
 
03:28:01.610 --> 03:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
now it's the first 250 million but it's
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
always that question about am I you know
 
03:28:06.170 --> 03:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
we could do a deferred maintenance list
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's about I don't know a billion
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
dollars if we wanted to and we could do
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive evaluation of every
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
building which we're looking at doing
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
anyway that could get you what's the
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
lifespan of everything but what we do is
 
03:28:21.530 --> 03:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
we we know that you know the state
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the capacity to to repair
 
03:28:26.690 --> 03:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
as much as you might if you had had the
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
money so the idea is to is to triage
 
03:28:31.370 --> 03:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
like anything else you do and you look
 
03:28:32.690 --> 03:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
at it and say
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
can this weight you know is this part of
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is what's the need today is this
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
Dreadful today maybe maybe not but it's
 
03:28:42.410 --> 03:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
going to be Dreadful in two years is
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
this something where we can we can you
 
03:28:45.889 --> 03:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
know rebuild something
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
and um and it'll be okay for six to
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
eight years and and and where do you get
 
03:28:52.010 --> 03:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
there I mean people are familiar for
 
03:28:53.450 --> 03:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
example with the parking garage where
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know every every two years you know
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
we throw a little bit of money at it and
 
03:28:59.210 --> 03:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
it and it lasts for a little bit longer
 
03:29:00.889 --> 03:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
and it's like that used car you had
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
you've got a 73 Nova where you uh had a
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
73 Nova and um it's a very heavy car and
 
03:29:10.190 --> 03:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
safe but um I got eight miles to the
 
03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
gallon and uh but you routinely you're
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
like okay the muffler and like well I
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
don't mind the noise I'm not going to do
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
the muffler I'm going to do the right
 
03:29:18.530 --> 03:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
rear tire because it's worse than the
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
left rear tire and you just you like can
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
I get another two years out of this or
 
03:29:23.929 --> 03:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
do I need to make a bigger investment
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
and so every day we're making decisions
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
like that and Karen has an enormous team
 
03:29:30.769 --> 03:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
of people it's not really enormous is it
 
03:29:33.530 --> 03:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's Karen is a team of people
 
03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
um who work on this every day who are
 
03:29:36.410 --> 03:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
sort of walking to buildings and looking
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
around and and
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
all of you at some point have had a
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm sure in some State office
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
where you you
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the chairman because I
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
think we had one where he was appalled
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
at the room I had him in
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
um because it was kind of a it's the
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
room I have almost every meeting I have
 
03:29:56.570 --> 03:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
in just for the record but it it could
 
03:29:57.889 --> 03:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
use a little work
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
and so uh you do the best you can
 
03:30:03.229 --> 03:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
that make sense
 
03:30:05.330 --> 03:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
and for Mr Arling I'll say a little bit
 
03:30:07.729 --> 03:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
of work is a is an exaggeration I hope
 
03:30:10.190 --> 03:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
you still don't have that Nova but we do
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
need to get to that room yeah do you
 
03:30:14.090 --> 03:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
have more presentation before we take
 
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
questions because the only the only
 
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
thing left was I'm going to tell you
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
about our projects uh what we got and
 
03:30:21.229 --> 03:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
what we're gonna ask for but you want to
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
do that first please okay
 
03:30:24.650 --> 03:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
um Karen's going to do that
 
03:30:28.490 --> 03:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
great so I'm on slide 15 which has um
 
03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
the projects that are in the governor's
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just go through those and
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
just give a little overview Courthouse
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
generators so we have five remaining
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
courthouses that could use emergency
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
generation and we prioritized
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
um the ones that were in the uh most
 
03:30:48.530 --> 03:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
remote or severe weather climates first
 
03:30:50.809 --> 03:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
so those ones um are currently underway
 
03:30:53.150 --> 03:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
but there's five more that could use an
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
emergency generator for for power outage
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
situations so that's the first project
 
03:30:59.450 --> 03:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
on the list the Rochester courthouse is
 
03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
new construction so there's a design
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
design was approved in the last budget
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
and that design is happening now this
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
would be the money to construct that new
 
03:31:08.279 --> 03:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
would be the money to construct that new
courthouse

03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
um project number three the Emergency
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
Operations Center mechanical
 
03:31:15.889 --> 03:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
Replacements and repairs so the EOC is a
 
03:31:18.050 --> 03:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
24 7 operation
 
03:31:20.030 --> 03:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
um critical you know to the needs of the
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire here and there's
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
a few mechanical things that need to be
 
03:31:25.729 --> 03:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
replaced over there including some water
 
03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
tanks so that is a high priority on the
 
03:31:29.100 --> 03:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
tanks so that is a high priority on the
list

03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
there building which houses Health and
 
03:31:34.929 --> 03:31:34.939 align:start position:0%
Human Services office staff
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
has very few heating zones so it's a
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
large large building and if you turn the
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
heat on it's on and if you turn it off
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's off and it makes for an energy
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
inefficient building as well as an
 
03:31:46.849 --> 03:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable building to be in so we're
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
looking to add some more zones to the
 
03:31:50.450 --> 03:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
heating system over there and then
 
03:31:50.460 --> 03:31:51.530 align:start position:0%
heating system over there and then
finally

03:31:51.530 --> 03:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
finally
 
03:31:51.540 --> 03:31:52.370 align:start position:0%
finally
um

03:31:52.370 --> 03:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:55.130 --> 03:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
everybody we request money for the
 
03:31:56.809 --> 03:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
Statewide emergency fund and that's a
 
03:31:58.190 --> 03:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
fund that's managed in my office
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
available to All State agencies that
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
have state-owned property and that is
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
available for things that are unforeseen
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have I think we had a rest
 
03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
area that got struck by lightning and
 
03:32:10.849 --> 03:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
had some electrical repairs that needed
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
to be done and that agency wasn't able
 
03:32:14.809 --> 03:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
to cover that in their operating budget
 
03:32:16.370 --> 03:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
so they come to me and they ask for
 
03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
money from the Statewide emergency fund
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
to cover those costs and so we've
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
provided funding for I think All State
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
agencies at at one point or another to
 
03:32:28.250 --> 03:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
cover some sort of unforeseen event that
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.210 --> 03:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
um the next slide which I think is the
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
last slide
 
03:32:37.080 --> 03:32:37.729 align:start position:0%
last slide
um

03:32:37.729 --> 03:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:39.650 --> 03:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take the opportunity to
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
talk about some operational challenges
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
and additional needs that we have so
 
03:32:47.690 --> 03:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
again the the form 1as that were done uh
 
03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
a year ago I think had about 40 or 45
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
projects for the Department of
 
03:32:54.410 --> 03:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
administrative Services we saw the five
 
03:32:56.090 --> 03:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
on the last slide that were that made it
 
03:32:58.250 --> 03:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
into the governor's phase a couple other
 
03:33:00.650 --> 03:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
things for consideration one of the the
 
03:33:02.809 --> 03:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
kind of critical projects that was cut
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
late in the process was replacement of
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
some chillers at 29 Hazen which is where
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
some critical State Labs are housed
 
03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
some critical State Labs are housed
um

03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
that's a four to six million dollar
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
replacement for those Chillers
 
03:33:17.929 --> 03:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking in-house and and
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
decided a better way to address that
 
03:33:21.889 --> 03:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
issue is to rebuild the chillers and get
 
03:33:23.570 --> 03:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
as Charlie mentioned maybe another five
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
to eight years out of the equipment
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
um which I think is a good cost
 
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
investment and that would be closer to
 
03:33:30.170 --> 03:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
300 000 that we'd be looking to cover
 
03:33:32.210 --> 03:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
the cost of that
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
um we're in the process or getting ready
 
03:33:38.090 --> 03:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
to go out to bid for phase one of the
 
03:33:40.729 --> 03:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
State House Annex renovation project
 
03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
um which would be a full renovation
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
including adding HVAC to a building that
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't currently have it
 
03:33:48.769 --> 03:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
um making better use of the space and
 
03:33:50.570 --> 03:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
making it overall just a better place to
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
come to work too
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
um so funding for the next phase of that
 
03:33:56.570 --> 03:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
project was an original Quest request at
 
03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
4.3 million
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
and then finally something that's been
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
neglected over the past five or so years
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
is Paving so
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
um as many of you probably know if you
 
03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
don't keep up with Paving it just
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
continues to deteriorate and get worse
 
03:34:11.330 --> 03:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of behind schedule on
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
keeping up with our Paving of parking
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
lots and our roadways that we manage so
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
we manage roadways on like the New
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital campus and up on
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
Hayes and drive
 
03:34:22.490 --> 03:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
so just to kind of cover some of you
 
03:34:23.929 --> 03:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
know to catch us up to where we should
 
03:34:23.939 --> 03:34:24.710 align:start position:0%
know to catch us up to where we should
be

03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
um you know requesting a three million
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to do some of that Paving work
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done
 
03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:32.330 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done
foreign

03:34:32.330 --> 03:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:34:37.370 --> 03:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
so if so this last page here operational
 
03:34:40.450 --> 03:34:40.460 align:start position:0%
challenge additional needs
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the event that money could be found
 
03:34:45.530 --> 03:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
this is the priority and the numbers
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
that of projects you'd like to proceed
 
03:34:47.819 --> 03:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
that of projects you'd like to proceed
with

03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
could I um ask you I'll ask you a few
 
03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
questions if I could
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
so for the new members can you explain
 
03:35:01.130 --> 03:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire hospital
 
03:35:01.140 --> 03:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire hospital
complex

03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
complex
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
what what it is and other than Health
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services who's occupying that
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
sure please so the Pleasant Street
 
03:35:16.010 --> 03:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
campus which is sometimes called Sops or
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
the State Office Park South or the
 
03:35:20.290 --> 03:35:20.300 align:start position:0%
gallon I think it is Office Park
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
is on Pleasant Street kind of near
 
03:35:24.889 --> 03:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
Concord High School and all that all the
 
03:35:27.290 --> 03:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
old buildings are used currently by the
 
03:35:29.330 --> 03:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
state for government there's a newer
 
03:35:31.729 --> 03:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
building it's the mid 80s but
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm old enough that that counts as
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
new which is the actual New Hampshire
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
hospital the acute psychiatric facility
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
or APS there's an S there I don't know
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
03:35:42.359 --> 03:35:43.250 align:start position:0%
what it is
um

03:35:43.250 --> 03:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
the old buildings were slowly repurposed
 
03:35:46.670 --> 03:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
and their repurposed originally
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
according to a to a plan that was
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
developed I want to say in the late 90s
 
03:35:54.290 --> 03:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
early 2000s uh representative uh kalawa
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
from Litchfield I think was very
 
03:35:58.010 --> 03:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
instrumental in that and we looked at
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
buildings and and people might remember
 
03:36:01.969 --> 03:36:01.979 align:start position:0%
if you've been around long enough that
 
03:36:04.370 --> 03:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
like the Walker building which is one of
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
our nicer buildings was going to be
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's a capital budget appropriation
 
03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
to tear it down
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we got money to tear down
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
before my time but
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and um and a woman who's later a
 
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
State Rep on City councilor in Concord
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
Kathy Rogers who passed away recently I
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
think chained herself to a tree and to
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
stop that from happening it's actually a
 
03:36:26.809 --> 03:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
lovely building I remember from when I
 
03:36:28.250 --> 03:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
was first married I would say to my wife
 
03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
this is the stupid thing people do they
 
03:36:32.090 --> 03:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
want to tear down this this pretty
 
03:36:35.570 --> 03:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
building and well we didn't and so part
 
03:36:37.130 --> 03:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
of that was we developed a plan for that
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
over time they've developed into offices
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of the buildings are occupied by
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
HHS for their various space there's a
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
big building on the hill called the main
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
building which is mostly HHS and maybe
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
50 000 square feet of Corrections for a
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
lot of their offices
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh Thayer which is as you turn in the
 
03:36:55.729 --> 03:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
first drive was the building right in
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
03:37:00.050 --> 03:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
um is I think entirely HHS behind Thayer
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
is Spalding which is labor I'm going to
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
get some of this wrong but I'm going to
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
try behind Spalding is laundergan which
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
was education although if we end up
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
buying Hull Street they would they would
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
move there and that building which is
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
03:37:16.130 --> 03:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
um worst buildings in terms of needs
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
would be renovated next to londergan is
 
03:37:21.889 --> 03:37:21.899 align:start position:0%
dra which is all sometimes called
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical but that's where
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
dra is in their offices it's the old
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical building which is
 
03:37:28.729 --> 03:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
why they say there are ghosts in the
 
03:37:28.739 --> 03:37:30.050 align:start position:0%
why they say there are ghosts in the
basement

03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
basement
 
03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:30.650 align:start position:0%
basement
um

03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
in front of that is Johnson stop me if I
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
get something wrong
 
03:37:36.170 --> 03:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
um in front of that is Johnson which has
 
03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
Board of tax and land appeals and a
 
03:37:39.650 --> 03:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
couple of other things uh housing
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
appeals board used to have the
 
03:37:43.610 --> 03:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
governor's office of energy and planning
 
03:37:45.769 --> 03:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
which doesn't exist anymore
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it has a child advocate is in
 
03:37:49.729 --> 03:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
there as well so in a couple of small
 
03:37:49.739 --> 03:37:51.490 align:start position:0%
there as well so in a couple of small
entities

03:37:51.490 --> 03:37:51.500 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:37:54.530 --> 03:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
just beyond that is dollar which has a
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
sort of a some some frosted glass on the
 
03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
front of it you'll know it in that way
 
03:38:00.650 --> 03:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
mostly HHS I think there's a talking
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
books thing in there and there are a
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
couple of other smaller entities some of
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
which are states some of which aren't
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
um up from that is the Brown building
 
03:38:11.929 --> 03:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
which is hhs's headquarters and has a
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
parking garage attached to it it's
 
03:38:16.370 --> 03:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
behind the main building if you will
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
next to that I believe is Thayer
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
no it's the old Toby school I take that
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
back the old Toby school which is
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
Employment Security one of the more
 
03:38:28.130 --> 03:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
recently renovated buildings and it's
 
03:38:29.929 --> 03:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
quite lovely it just shows you what
 
03:38:33.170 --> 03:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
federal funds can do next to that uh
 
03:38:34.729 --> 03:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
sort of next to that and on the one
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
corner the corner of fruit and pleasant
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
is the Walker building which has
 
03:38:40.969 --> 03:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
Insurance on one end you said the puc on
 
03:38:42.650 --> 03:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
the other now it's the department of
 
03:38:44.450 --> 03:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
energy and what and the residual puc
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
that exists there I think Voc Rehab from
 
03:38:49.429 --> 03:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and the
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
disability determination unit of the
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is there as well
 
03:38:53.640 --> 03:38:55.610 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is there as well
and

03:38:55.610 --> 03:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:55.620 --> 03:38:56.210 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:38:56.210 --> 03:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's somebody and Associate
 
03:39:00.769 --> 03:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
entities like the child at the consumer
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
advocate for them in site selection so
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's most of that building some of the
 
03:39:07.010 --> 03:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
buildings on that campus which we don't
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
manage if people stay in a building we
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
don't manage it you know so Corrections
 
03:39:12.650 --> 03:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
we don't manage any corrections
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
buildings but transitional housing so
 
03:39:16.190 --> 03:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
some of the things that look like houses
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
are mostly transitional housing and it's
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
people I think I'll get this right
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
who've left the hospital like they're
 
03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:23.690 align:start position:0%
who've left the hospital like they're
not

03:39:23.690 --> 03:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
um in the psychiatric hospital anymore
 
03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
and they're theoretically transitioning
 
03:39:30.410 --> 03:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
to the community and that exists there
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's a building also there that's
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
like a gym called Howard Rec which they
 
03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
use for some things and I think that's
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
most of the buildings
 
03:39:41.450 --> 03:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
oh records and archives
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
and Phil Brook right so records and
 
03:39:44.929 --> 03:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
archives is also there at Secretary of
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
State's records and archives which you
 
03:39:49.130 --> 03:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
know we've expanded a couple times I
 
03:39:50.450 --> 03:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
think it might actually technically be
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
called the Leon Anderson building
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
um but I think we've expanded it uh
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
twice and it fills up very fast because
 
03:39:58.610 --> 03:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
we generate a lot of stuff as a state
 
03:40:01.130 --> 03:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
and then on the other Corner which would
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
be I think Clinton and fruit is Phil
 
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
Brook which was part of the uh state
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
hospital then it wasn't for a while and
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
we had a couple of entities there like
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
oplc and then it is again because they
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
needed it was the easiest building to
 
03:40:20.269 --> 03:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
renovate back into patient space I don't
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
know exactly who's there as opposed to
 
03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
in the hospital itself on the edge of
 
03:40:26.690 --> 03:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
the campus on Clinton Street looks like
 
03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's carved out of the campus but we
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't always consider it part of the
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
campus is the Concord uh District Court
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court District Court District
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
Court and so that's that's on Clinton
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
Street kind of at the one kind of where
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
Bo Brook crosses Clinton Street and I
 
03:40:44.330 --> 03:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
think that's all of them that's a lot of
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
the State offices and and when the plans
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
were originally done they're still in
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's still an old master plan which
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
probably could be updated but um dating
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
back to about 04 and and it envisions
 
03:40:56.809 --> 03:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
moving people out of rented space into
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
space there which we did a lot of over
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
over the
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Charlie I was just going to
 
03:41:08.269 --> 03:41:08.279 align:start position:0%
ask you for a map of those locations but
 
03:41:11.090 --> 03:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
that was a great dissertation we can we
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
can get you a map yeah if you could they
 
03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh so Lonergan which brings me to 25
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
Hall Street
 
03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
so in the last capital budget we
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
appropriated a amount of money I think
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
we were fixing a
 
03:41:27.650 --> 03:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
toilets bathrooms were so bad they were
 
03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to have people in the
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
education building and then I think we
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
added more on to that how much of that
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
was completed
 
03:41:35.880 --> 03:41:37.309 align:start position:0%
was completed
and

03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:40.010 --> 03:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
who is who
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
whom do you see then going into that
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
space or what's the schedule to renovate
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
that space because I was here back when
 
03:41:52.729 --> 03:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
that was 2005 era we were looking to
 
03:41:56.090 --> 03:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
move from outside to inside that we
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
would recoup that space let me let me
 
03:42:00.889 --> 03:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
have Karen talk a little bit about where
 
03:42:02.450 --> 03:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
we are on things like the elevators and
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms and Asbestos and then I'll
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the broader
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
space planning issues we have okay
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
um this started as an abatement project
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
um the entire building has been abated
 
03:42:15.769 --> 03:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
of asbestos
 
03:42:17.210 --> 03:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
um other than things that might be like
 
03:42:18.889 --> 03:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
behind walls that we're not going to
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
open up uh just for the sake of getting
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
asbestos out of it
 
03:42:24.769 --> 03:42:24.779 align:start position:0%
um so it was abated
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
um we did design a project for the
 
03:42:28.010 --> 03:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
elevator and bathrooms and the
 
03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
restoration of the ceilings that had to
 
03:42:31.130 --> 03:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
be removed because the ceilings had
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
asbestos in it that went out to bid
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
um when the bids came back we didn't
 
03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
have enough funding to complete the
 
03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
project so it kind of got tabled
 
03:42:43.969 --> 03:42:43.979 align:start position:0%
um for now we have some arpa funding in
 
03:42:45.769 --> 03:42:45.779 align:start position:0%
our deferred maintenance that we'd like
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
to do some additional work to launder
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
again and so what we decided to do was
 
03:42:52.190 --> 03:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
keep the design for the original
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
components that was done incorporate
 
03:42:56.690 --> 03:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
that into a larger project and bid it
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
out all as one big project so that will
 
03:43:02.090 --> 03:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
be coming out later this spring we'll be
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
bidding that out again as a as a more
 
03:43:07.130 --> 03:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
com comprehensive renovation roughly how
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
long do we think it'll take
 
03:43:10.490 --> 03:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we're thinking once a bit once the
 
03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
the boots at the ground so to speak
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
it'll be about a 12-month uh renovation
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
project and how much how much space
 
03:43:19.849 --> 03:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
ballpark square footage or how many
 
03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
offices were there yeah so laundry
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
again's about 50 000 square feet
 
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
um it is all little tiny not little tiny
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
but all individual offices so to speak
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that's just the way that it was
 
03:43:31.729 --> 03:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
built because it was an old dormitory
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and based on our initial look at
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
things it's going to remain that way
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
because of structural components that
 
03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
are in the walls and so it will be a lot
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
of individual office space but we're
 
03:43:43.190 --> 03:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
looking to like widen the doorways
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
doorways are not up to code right now
 
03:43:46.490 --> 03:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's no HVAC in there so we're
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
looking to bring it up to a more modern
 
03:43:50.450 --> 03:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
space thank you
 
03:43:52.729 --> 03:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
um the the question about who goes where
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
is a it's a uh is a good question and
 
03:43:57.650 --> 03:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's also um you know we think about it
 
03:43:59.870 --> 03:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
long term with a building I didn't name
 
03:44:01.849 --> 03:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
which is Bancroft which is sort of next
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the main building and and what they
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
call Annex one on that campus which is
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
which is lovely from the outside and
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
we've stabilized their money in one of
 
03:44:11.090 --> 03:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
the capital budgets recently to
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
stabilize it
 
03:44:14.809 --> 03:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and it has a lot of touches inside
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not occupiable now but what
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
would what would go in there is one of
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
03:44:21.530 --> 03:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
um there are a bunch of things that are
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
happening right so the one is the whole
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
notion of granite place and the the old
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Financial building where doj is
 
03:44:29.210 --> 03:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
going to move and who else can go in
 
03:44:29.220 --> 03:44:30.530 align:start position:0%
going to move and who else can go in
there

03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
um there are about five or six other
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
components that are happening
 
03:44:35.279 --> 03:44:35.929 align:start position:0%
components that are happening
um

03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:37.729 --> 03:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
you know Corrections it doesn't like
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
their their current space in the main
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
building partly because the main
 
03:44:42.410 --> 03:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
building is e
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
um but partly because they're not
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
connected to each other there are
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
various components
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
um there's a building on South Street
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
um sort of toward if anyone knows where
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
Tucker's is the restaurant it's sort of
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
toward there
 
03:44:56.210 --> 03:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
um it's actually the old New Hampshire
 
03:44:59.929 --> 03:44:59.939 align:start position:0%
Memorial Hospital and um
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
um doit had had a piece of it and his
 
03:45:03.889 --> 03:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
little tiny piece of HHS and there's a
 
03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
discussion about what to do with that we
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
look at these spaces and we think with
 
03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
it with the annex renovation at least
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
part of it even though the initial
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
phases of that renovation are broadly
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
mechanical and a lot of the
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure because that's where you
 
03:45:18.590 --> 03:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to start
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
um there's going to be a lot of moving
 
03:45:21.050 --> 03:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
pieces that go there you know does
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
agriculture move to Granite place maybe
 
03:45:25.610 --> 03:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
maybe not where does Corrections go
 
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
where does doit who has a unit that was
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
in South Street but they want to move
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
out and they're going to start hoteling
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
using fewer desks because of remote work
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
where they're better suited to and so
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do all of those in
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
addition there's a couple of small
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
agencies that are might have like Human
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission for example has to get
 
03:45:48.590 --> 03:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
out of their space by October hmm I
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
don't know where everybody's going I I
 
03:45:52.010 --> 03:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
will tell you this that we have a we
 
03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
have a meeting on our schedule I think
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
Karen and Cassie and I next week
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
maybe Friday I don't know next week
 
03:45:59.340 --> 03:46:00.590 align:start position:0%
maybe Friday I don't know next week
probably

03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:46:01.849 --> 03:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
um it was supposed to be yesterday but
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
it got moved
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things we're doing is
 
03:46:06.769 --> 03:46:06.779 align:start position:0%
looking at the giant jigsaw puzzle but
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's a giant jigsaw puzzle
 
03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
that's not really that helpful is it uh
 
03:46:15.050 --> 03:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
well it's a start and thank you so when
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
I when I look and see that you know we
 
03:46:22.130 --> 03:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
have we have the courthouse so again
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
that building what are we going to do
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
with that Old Courthouse do we retain
 
03:46:29.330 --> 03:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
that space we own that space
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
so what's going to happen with that so
 
03:46:33.429 --> 03:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
like Rochester do you know the Rochester
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
so the city approached us on that and
 
03:46:39.410 --> 03:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
they are interested in the building they
 
03:46:41.330 --> 03:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
would like the building for City
 
03:46:44.210 --> 03:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
operations in exchange there they want
 
03:46:46.010 --> 03:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
to work something out to give us some
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
land where we can build this the new
 
03:46:50.170 --> 03:46:50.180 align:start position:0%
proposed Courthouse
 
03:46:53.210 --> 03:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
we do have some language that I believe
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
Senator gray drafted up
 
03:46:55.380 --> 03:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
Senator gray drafted up
um

03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:58.190 --> 03:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
to possibly you know facilitate that
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
can you also I'm telling us can you
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
speak of the
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere there's a lot of
 
03:47:11.330 --> 03:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
projects outside of here that have been
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
funded through arpa funds or cash that
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
was turned could you talk to us about
 
03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:19.790 align:start position:0%
was turned could you talk to us about
that

03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it's the short answer
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
um we could shut the camera off if we
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
could no no no
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
um we um
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
so uh someone so the short version I
 
03:47:32.690 --> 03:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't know everything that was
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate with our Pro we think we do
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we think we know you know if they
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
end up if they end up um Waltzing
 
03:47:39.410 --> 03:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
through Ted we know what we know what a
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
lot of those are and and of course it's
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
been an issue right the last three
 
03:47:46.130 --> 03:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
budgets if we count this one have had
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
significant House Bill 2 Appropriations
 
03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
that are quasi-capital and it's not
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
something that existed before I think
 
03:47:55.729 --> 03:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative evil has a amendment to
 
03:47:57.050 --> 03:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh to another bill that would actually
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
change the name of the capital
 
03:48:01.130 --> 03:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
budget overview Community a couple of
 
03:48:03.170 --> 03:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
projects overview committee and I said
 
03:48:05.150 --> 03:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
well I think that makes sense because we
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
used to think of all of that stuff as
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
happening in the capital budget and it
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't I can tell you what we're doing
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
with we have two we have an HVAC
 
03:48:14.809 --> 03:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
um our appropriation of something like
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
18 or 20 million dollars
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I can tell you what's
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
what's in that we have a deferred
 
03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
maintenance one and I can tell you
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
what's in that I can give you a list
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I know Parks has one too or
 
03:48:28.969 --> 03:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
dncr I should say has one as well which
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
is wide ranging in terms of capital like
 
03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:33.950 align:start position:0%
is wide ranging in terms of capital like
Construction

03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
Construction
 
03:48:38.210 --> 03:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not too sure about many others
 
03:48:40.130 --> 03:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
if we could see a list at another time
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know what I'll do I'll ask you why
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
don't I ask Ted at a start so I'll give
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
you ours let me ask Ted to put together
 
03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
a list of projects that are at public
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
works so to speak that are not funded
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
for the capital budget
 
03:48:53.809 --> 03:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll start with that and we'll
 
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
get you a list and my last question
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
before I turn it over to the committee
 
03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:58.550 align:start position:0%
before I turn it over to the committee
is

03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:02.450 --> 03:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
um the emergency uh fund which is in
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
here for what's it 1.5 million dollars
 
03:49:08.210 --> 03:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
or something could you uh send to us
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last three or
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
four years how much of that it's very
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
important I'm not saying it's not but if
 
03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
you could just if you could just tell us
 
03:49:19.490 --> 03:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
what's actually been expended what was
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what was expended that
 
03:49:23.809 --> 03:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful other questions
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee I'll start with
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
represent Connor
 
03:49:30.650 --> 03:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
did you guys ever thank you uh Mr
 
03:49:30.660 --> 03:49:31.790 align:start position:0%
did you guys ever thank you uh Mr
chairman

03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I just want to know what a what is a
 
03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:39.170 align:start position:0%
um I just want to know what a what is a
chiller

03:49:39.170 --> 03:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
oh a chiller yes it's like air
 
03:49:43.610 --> 03:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
conditioning but do you wanna do you
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
want to get yeah more detail it's a
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
component of the central HVAC system
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
that you know sits outside it makes cold
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
water that then circulates through the
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.769 --> 03:50:00.779 align:start position:0%
if I can I got a couple
 
03:50:03.889 --> 03:50:03.899 align:start position:0%
um commissioner you've got a requests in
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
here for the next phase of the annex and
 
03:50:08.809 --> 03:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
when you hit 50 you have to become ADA
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
Compliant and I guess my question is why
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
haven't we become ADA Compliant earlier
 
03:50:18.769 --> 03:50:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's embarrassing and horrible that it
 
03:50:19.969 --> 03:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done it should have been
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
done yesterday can you tell me how we're
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to have it done tomorrow
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're um what we what we do with with
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
Adas we work very closely with the
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on disability was
 
03:50:30.889 --> 03:50:30.899 align:start position:0%
an ADA coordinator although I think that
 
03:50:33.290 --> 03:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
position is is open right now or that's
 
03:50:35.450 --> 03:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
not that's not her title but what it is
 
03:50:37.130 --> 03:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
and and when we do any construction
 
03:50:37.140 --> 03:50:38.990 align:start position:0%
and and when we do any construction
project

03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:39.769 align:start position:0%
project
um

03:50:39.769 --> 03:50:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's a significant component of it is
 
03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
that is that we take any building that
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
exists today and make it uh make it ADA
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
Compliant and fix the things that aren't
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
fixed and I'm going to use two examples
 
03:50:52.250 --> 03:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
of that that
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know laundry and for example the
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
the this discussion of the bathrooms and
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
whether they're ADA Compliant or not
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
when when a significant
 
03:51:02.929 --> 03:51:02.939 align:start position:0%
um uh when significant work on them was
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
done in the 90s I think they were made
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant within the terms of the
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
law at the time because nothing's been
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
done since then no additional work was
 
03:51:13.610 --> 03:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
done are they great no
 
03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
um but that's why we're fixing them with
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
the annex you know one of the questions
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
is right now the Ada access to the
 
03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
annexes is that there's a door that used
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
to be the division of personnel that's
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
um street level on School Street used to
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
be the state police too if you're
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
keeping score
 
03:51:31.729 --> 03:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
um and um and that's the that's the ADA
 
03:51:33.769 --> 03:51:33.779 align:start position:0%
compliance we had a discussion about
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
whether that's an appropriate
 
03:51:38.690 --> 03:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not and the problem is
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's a little too much separate but
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
equal and it's a little too Plessy and
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
not enough Brown if you know
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh so we're doing something
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
significant and when are we doing it in
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
the process phase one not phase two not
 
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
phase three but we're doing it right up
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
front that's actually I think literally
 
03:51:54.769 --> 03:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
the first thing we're doing we're
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
putting a lift in in essentially in the
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
front of the building
 
03:52:00.889 --> 03:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
are what we do with every building is
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
that because
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the significant changes that you make
 
03:52:07.490 --> 03:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
you want to make when you're when you're
 
03:52:10.070 --> 03:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
doing something else in addition to that
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a sort of an easier
 
03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism it's very easy to
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
say to an agency doing work you got to
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
do this and so it's it's uh it's a it is
 
03:52:22.610 --> 03:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
a significant priority of every new
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
construction that we do oops and if I
 
03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:26.939 align:start position:0%
can follow up
 
03:52:26.939 --> 03:52:29.630 align:start position:0%
can follow up
um

03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
you've you've gone through a whole
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
process of of uh Round Rob and where
 
03:52:36.530 --> 03:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
everybody has to go for office space and
 
03:52:40.190 --> 03:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's always revolving and changing and
 
03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
then you mentioned the annex and you're
 
03:52:45.050 --> 03:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
doing the construction and trying to
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
figure out who's going to do what or
 
03:52:48.290 --> 03:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
where or whatever
 
03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
and it just seems a little backwards to
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
me that
 
03:52:53.809 --> 03:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
you'd figure that out before you do any
 
03:52:53.819 --> 03:52:54.889 align:start position:0%
you'd figure that out before you do any
renovation

03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
and you can plan your renovation from
 
03:52:59.330 --> 03:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
that perspective and I guess what I'm
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
asking is you're looking for some money
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's already money on the table
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
is there a detailed plan that we can see
 
03:53:11.809 --> 03:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
of what you're trying to do and what
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to become because I hear
 
03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
rumors that part of the upstairs already
 
03:53:19.690 --> 03:53:19.700 align:start position:0%
looks like a layout from Amazon or Ebay
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:53:21.540 --> 03:53:22.550 align:start position:0%
and that
um

03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:24.889 --> 03:53:24.899 align:start position:0%
government does need privacy and
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
security government does need offices
 
03:53:28.969 --> 03:53:28.979 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to cop discuss
 
03:53:31.010 --> 03:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
Personnel plans you have to entertain
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
people like us and explain stuff when
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
we're stupid
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
and two conference rooms here or for the
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
building doesn't seem to make can we see
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
a detailed plan yes absolutely I I could
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
I could show you anytime time and I can
 
03:53:45.410 --> 03:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
bring for the committee um the the
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
detailed layouts
 
03:53:47.279 --> 03:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
detailed layouts
um

03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
they won't necessarily be 100 bidable
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
documents but in terms of floor plans
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
and things like that you can see what's
 
03:53:52.979 --> 03:53:54.290 align:start position:0%
and things like that you can see what's
happening

03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I know what you're referring to
 
03:53:57.889 --> 03:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a in one corner of the
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
fourth floor we did of the annex we did
 
03:54:01.140 --> 03:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
fourth floor we did of the annex we did
um

03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:05.150 --> 03:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
we did asbestos remediation at the end
 
03:54:07.370 --> 03:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
of 2021 there was money in the
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget because of covet
 
03:54:10.969 --> 03:54:10.979 align:start position:0%
frankly and we tore down some walls it
 
03:54:12.410 --> 03:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
happened to be that that group which was
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
the computer group was out of the
 
03:54:15.889 --> 03:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
building at the time we got rid of a lot
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
of walls it's very wide open space not
 
03:54:19.849 --> 03:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
everybody likes that not everybody likes
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
to work in a cubicle
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
um it's not where we're going to be in
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
the end the number of individual offices
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the annex when the renovation is done
 
03:54:30.530 --> 03:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
will be the same number I think give or
 
03:54:32.210 --> 03:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
take two
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
um as it exists today
 
03:54:36.530 --> 03:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
what will exist there will be more
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
conference rooms and more additional
 
03:54:40.130 --> 03:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
private space for example space for
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
making phone calls but space for
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
meetings with small groups and large
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
groups and it'll just be more functional
 
03:54:47.689 --> 03:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to show you plans and
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
realistically anytime we're building
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
anything there's no reason anybody on
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
the committee can't um can't see those
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
plans or you know walk through them one
 
03:54:57.050 --> 03:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the things I'd like to you know
 
03:54:58.490 --> 03:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
probably you're not going to want to do
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
it in this phase of your deliberations
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
but we'd love to walk you through some
 
03:55:04.370 --> 03:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the buildings and we could even go
 
03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
through the tunnels at the hospital
 
03:55:08.330 --> 03:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
campus if you wanted some people like
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
that some people are spooked out
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
now I I appreciate that and we will work
 
03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
with you to make that happen great um
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newton yes thank you
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
could you briefly explain
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
the procedure uh and specific Rochester
 
03:55:24.479 --> 03:55:25.969 align:start position:0%
the procedure uh and specific Rochester
Courthouse

03:55:25.969 --> 03:55:25.979 align:start position:0%
Courthouse
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Old Courthouse
 
03:55:29.450 --> 03:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
when they say when the state gets a
 
03:55:31.969 --> 03:55:31.979 align:start position:0%
building that they no longer
 
03:55:34.130 --> 03:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
have use for I guess if that's what we
 
03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
would call it or how you'd put it is
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
there a bidding process does the state
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
say we need to see if the state needs it
 
03:55:41.279 --> 03:55:42.070 align:start position:0%
say we need to see if the state needs it
first

03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:55:45.889 --> 03:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
then do offer to the city then you offer
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
to bidding or is the city part of the
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
bidding process after I think in this
 
03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:52.670 align:start position:0%
bidding process after I think in this
case

03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:55:54.889 --> 03:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused because for the
 
03:55:58.610 --> 03:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
city to get the design funding they had
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
to provide land for the new courthouse
 
03:56:04.189 --> 03:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
and that was done and now you're saying
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
from what I heard that they might get
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
the Old Courthouse and trade for the
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
land that they had to buy to get the
 
03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:12.309 align:start position:0%
land that they had to buy to get the
design

03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
design
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward with the design and we
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
did spend as a state we spent several a
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
few hundred thousand dollars just
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
recently to upgrade the HVAC system and
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
stuff in the Old Courthouse so I guess
 
03:56:28.370 --> 03:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
how do you guarantee to the taxpayer
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the state is getting the best bang
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
for the black for the taxpayer when
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
something like this takes place let me
 
03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
let me let Karen talk a little bit about
 
03:56:37.560 --> 03:56:38.870 align:start position:0%
let me let Karen talk a little bit about
about

03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:56:42.170 --> 03:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
um Rochester right uh in a second and as
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know courts are courts have a
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
slightly different governing mechanism
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
because there's a court accreditation
 
03:56:49.010 --> 03:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee that that meets an over and
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
oversees things as well but let me add
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
something about Surplus property the
 
03:56:54.769 --> 03:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
state does not dispose of surplus
 
03:56:54.779 --> 03:56:56.210 align:start position:0%
state does not dispose of surplus
property

03:56:56.210 --> 03:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
um without offering it to other people
 
03:57:00.530 --> 03:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
are there occasional exceptions to that
 
03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
when we do something like a swap like a
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
land swap but there are significant
 
03:57:07.269 --> 03:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
approvals required for that there are
 
03:57:10.130 --> 03:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly complicated process that
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
involves long range for example it
 
03:57:15.889 --> 03:57:15.899 align:start position:0%
involves historical resources and I
 
03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
think most of the time court is involved
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say every single time
 
03:57:21.410 --> 03:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
but there are a whole bunch of different
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hoops that have to be jumped through
 
03:57:25.610 --> 03:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
before the state ever relinquishes any
 
03:57:27.769 --> 03:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
property of any sort that would all have
 
03:57:28.929 --> 03:57:28.939 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of Rochester I think it's been
 
03:57:34.130 --> 03:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
a sort of Cooperative process with the
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
city from early on and and we do want to
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that that the state gets what it
 
03:57:42.050 --> 03:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
needs while being accommodating to our
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
neighbors as well but Karen can talk a
 
03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
little bit about about where we are in
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
that process sure the um the
 
03:57:51.769 --> 03:57:51.779 align:start position:0%
appropriation from 2021 for the design
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
required us to come forward with a piece
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
of land that would be viable for
 
03:57:59.570 --> 03:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
construction so we did that it still
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
owned that piece of land is still owned
 
03:58:02.650 --> 03:58:02.660 align:start position:0%
by the city
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're willing to you know allow us to
 
03:58:07.250 --> 03:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
use that property to build the
 
03:58:09.290 --> 03:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
courthouse you know in exchange for the
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
building but it we came forward saying
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
in in public works did the study to show
 
03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
that yes that's a buildable piece of
 
03:58:17.570 --> 03:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
land it could fit the size building that
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
we're thinking of constructing it could
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
be cited here there's room for parking
 
03:58:23.870 --> 03:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
all those questions were answered we
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
brought that to the capital budget
 
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
overview committee for then approval to
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
move forward with the design so we're we
 
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to the point yet the
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
Project's not funded for construction as
 
03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know and so we haven't acquired
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
actually acquired the land yet it's just
 
03:58:40.490 --> 03:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick follow-up is anywhere in
 
03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
the process is there um
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
estimates of value so it's kind of like
 
03:58:52.370 --> 03:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
ten dollars for ten dollars is that is
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
that considered what the the value of
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
something is both the land and or the
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah as as part of the both the
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
acquisition and the disposal of property
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
we would we would have to present to uh
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
depending on who's doing the appropriate
 
03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:11.990 align:start position:0%
depending on who's doing the appropriate
body

03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
um estimates of costs and appraisals and
 
03:59:16.670 --> 03:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
and whatnot and all of those kind of
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
things we don't just kind of go yeah I
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mr chairman yes
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you my question is
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
about vehicle charging station I want to
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
ask you because you're the custodian the
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
State Building because otherwise I was
 
03:59:35.450 --> 03:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
thinking of asking every state agency
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
have any charging stations for either
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
state employees vehicles have been put
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
in or any anticipated in the next few
 
03:59:44.809 --> 03:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
years because of that reason my
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
background this is might be good for
 
03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
employee Recruitment and Retention
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
because the private sector is beginning
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
to install these charging stations as a
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
way to keep attract and keep employees I
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't know if the state's thought of
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
this and maybe even if there'd be a
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
small charge you know it could recoup
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
some of the costs so I don't know if you
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
thought about this and where this is
 
04:00:07.250 --> 04:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
going on now thanks so for example
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a it's a significant
 
04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
discussion point about the um uh the
 
04:00:14.330 --> 04:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage that
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
um is content that might be built or
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what I'm supposed to
 
04:00:17.880 --> 04:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what I'm supposed to
say

04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:00:21.710 --> 04:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh leaving aside that giant Tesla
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
banks at every liquor store that seemed
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
to exist we have some behind the boiler
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
house here and I know Karen some
 
04:00:31.370 --> 04:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so there there's a Federal grant
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
that Des
 
04:00:35.090 --> 04:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
um applied for on behalf of several
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
State facilities including I believe
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
Walker building and some up at Hazen
 
04:00:41.150 --> 04:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
drive those have not been installed yet
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think there's still some question
 
04:00:43.849 --> 04:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
about because of the federal funding
 
04:00:45.769 --> 04:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
aspect whether there's made in America
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
components and how to acquire something
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's made in America when there is
 
04:00:52.969 --> 04:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
nothing that's made in America so we're
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
struggling a little bit there but we
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:00:55.800 --> 04:00:56.830 align:start position:0%
have been
um

04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
including in any big major renovation
 
04:01:02.210 --> 04:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
where you're you're disrupting the
 
04:01:04.610 --> 04:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
ground anyway putting in conduits
 
04:01:06.530 --> 04:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
putting in the infrastructure as it's
 
04:01:08.510 --> 04:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
much much less expensive to do that at
 
04:01:10.210 --> 04:01:10.220 align:start position:0%
the time when you're already Excavating
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
in preparation of down the road if we
 
04:01:15.889 --> 04:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
you know were to need to add those so I
 
04:01:17.570 --> 04:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
think the the short answer is that we
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot yet but that we're
 
04:01:21.410 --> 04:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
definitely thinking about it and making
 
04:01:22.969 --> 04:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
plans to incorporate it in future
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
projects yes so that was what was done
 
04:01:28.910 --> 04:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
at the the Green Street Boiler House
 
04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
here downtown
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
um we knew kind of knew ahead of time
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
that we were going to be Excavating the
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
property and that it would make sense to
 
04:01:36.889 --> 04:01:36.899 align:start position:0%
put the conduit in and then later on We
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
did an RFP where a third party company
 
04:01:41.330 --> 04:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
came in and installed the Chargers they
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
own the Chargers they manage the
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
Chargers you pay with a credit card or a
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
an app I guess you can get and then we
 
04:01:50.210 --> 04:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed for the electricity
 
04:01:52.189 --> 04:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
component because that's a state expense
 
04:01:54.590 --> 04:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
but the company kind of manages the
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
entire program
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
chairman is this for in just employees
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
or the public or both so at the Boiler
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
House I believe the spaces are
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
um you know during the day they're for
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature to use at night it
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
becomes available for for anyone that's
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
parking downtown to use and in which
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
case they would you know they do need to
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
use a credit card or the app to to pay
 
04:02:17.809 --> 04:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
for the charging
 
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we're running a little late
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
um one one more item and you can get
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
back to me on it over at the hospital
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
campus if you can give me an update
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
where we are with and maybe it's already
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
been completely remediated the old Power
 
04:02:36.600 --> 04:02:39.349 align:start position:0%
been completely remediated the old Power
Plant

04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
I can just give you you know very quick
 
04:02:43.729 --> 04:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
kind of update so that project was split
 
04:02:45.769 --> 04:02:45.779 align:start position:0%
into two phases phase one was basically
 
04:02:47.929 --> 04:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
to get the building down and that was
 
04:02:47.939 --> 04:02:49.070 align:start position:0%
to get the building down and that was
done

04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you know about a year ago I think
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
phase two is underway now and that's
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
kind of restoring and supporting the
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
retaining wall to make sure that the
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
property is stable and and looks
 
04:03:00.889 --> 04:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
somewhat nice
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
um until we decide you know what we're
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
going to put on it long term thank you
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
yucky stuff all the yucky stuff is gone
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and thank you for
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%

background I hope that folks are
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%

on slide four just a brief note that
 
04:05:57.530 --> 04:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
these align with commissioner caswell's

moving to slide five
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget and zero
 
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation for Capital I'm going to
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
say that that's on me I had a
 
04:06:27.170 --> 04:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
conversation with the governor and with
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
Mr Scully a while back in preparation
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
for budget and he asked about capital
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
and I said to him that I I needed a
 
04:06:36.530 --> 04:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
little more time we need to think about
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
this as you'll see the second light of
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
that slide last March we had submitted
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
about 19 million dollars in projects
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
and what I said is that in the last year
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I've spent with the colleges and
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
become quite begun to question whether
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
or not we've really figured out fully
 
04:06:54.889 --> 04:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing with some of
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
those facilities more of our work is
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
online the utilization of that space is
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
not currently optimal and I'm not yet
 
04:07:04.729 --> 04:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
sure that we've got all of that mapped
 
04:07:07.010 --> 04:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
out so what I intended to say was I
 
04:07:08.330 --> 04:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
think we need a little more time for
 
04:07:10.490 --> 04:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
some of those projects I didn't expect
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
that this would turn into a zero
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
appropriation particularly because there
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
are some projects that I think are ready
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
to move forward and some ongoing
 
04:07:20.929 --> 04:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
critical needs for buildings and also
 
04:07:24.050 --> 04:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
for I.T
 
04:07:26.929 --> 04:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
um if you'll move on please to slide
 
04:07:26.939 --> 04:07:28.210 align:start position:0%
um if you'll move on please to slide

04:07:28.210 --> 04:07:28.220 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
the grid this is an outline you're going
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
to see a lot of things here there are
 
04:07:36.250 --> 04:07:36.260 align:start position:0%
roofs and rtus
 
04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
windows and things that are Life Safety
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
basic mechanics of making sure these
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
buildings are still functional that we
 
04:07:45.530 --> 04:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
continue to be good stewards of the
 
04:07:46.969 --> 04:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
buildings that we have and that we're
 
04:07:50.090 --> 04:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
going to continue to use also see some
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
requests specific to it Hardware that's
 
04:07:55.929 --> 04:07:55.939 align:start position:0%
end of life and and
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
some life cycle replacement needs that
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
on slide 8 the one specific Capital
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
project and respiratory therapy
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
laboratory this is a need Statewide has
 
04:08:15.410 --> 04:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
been identified in the southern part of
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
the state our River Valley Community
 
04:08:20.090 --> 04:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
College has a respiratory therapy
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
program and the opportunity here is to
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
repurpose space in Nashua make it usable
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
for respiratory therapy program that can
 
04:08:31.689 --> 04:08:31.699 align:start position:0%
serve that quarter of the state
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
we already have a model where River
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
Valley has developed an LPN program
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
which is now made available through four
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
other colleges under a single
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation it's the same approach
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
we'd propose to take so the opportunity
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
to get this program up and running
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
quickly and to begin to produce more
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapists for the southern
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
part of the state is is a fairly
 
04:08:57.290 --> 04:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
efficient one we believe
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
and uh stop there and see if I've got
 
04:09:02.689 --> 04:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
any questions yet
 
04:09:04.849 --> 04:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll I'll start and then we'll
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
fill in so
 
04:09:12.110 --> 04:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
if I if I were to look at your list that
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
you presented
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh critical maintenance your slide
 
04:09:19.370 --> 04:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
number seven yes sir and I were to look
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
at that are your are those prioritized
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
with what's most important to you
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay so the man the Manchester first
 
04:09:31.849 --> 04:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
three Manchester projects are are your
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
highest priority
 
04:09:36.050 --> 04:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay bring me to
 
04:09:38.570 --> 04:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
bring me now to this program the
 
04:09:41.650 --> 04:09:41.660 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy labs
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
are there would you be or do you partner
 
04:09:47.809 --> 04:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
with some other person when you do that
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
like you did with so many of your others
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
whether it was Automotive is that
 
04:09:56.570 --> 04:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
Standalone and how many how many if you
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
were to get that program how many jobs
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
do you think you'd create
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
well the state of New Hampshire
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
currently has 400 respiratory therapists
 
04:10:09.490 --> 04:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
by 2030 our economic and labor market
 
04:10:12.729 --> 04:10:12.739 align:start position:0%
folks tell us we'll need almost 500
 
04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
roughly 30 a year prepared and currently
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
our River Valley program produces about
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
a dozen graduates we think we can
 
04:10:23.150 --> 04:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
roughly double that in the next couple
 
04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
of years essentially meet the state's
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
ongoing need for delivering that that
 
04:10:30.290 --> 04:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
occupational certification
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
in that this would be your number one
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing on this programming side that you
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see happen correct okay
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes please representative thank you Chad
 
04:10:45.120 --> 04:10:47.210 align:start position:0%
yes please representative thank you Chad
so

04:10:47.210 --> 04:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:48.889 --> 04:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
a new program you're going to develop in
 
04:10:52.490 --> 04:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
at the NCC is that have you gotten
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
requests from the hospitals in Nashua
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
and nearby yes and I've had
 
04:10:57.239 --> 04:10:59.269 align:start position:0%
and nearby yes and I've had
conversations

04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
um and most recently happened to be at
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh CMC respiratory therapy is one of the
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
areas that they recognize the growing
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
need for the population that they serve
 
04:11:11.929 --> 04:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
and that we serve thank you thanks for
 
04:11:16.090 --> 04:11:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.490 --> 04:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
while I have you here how how is the LPN
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
program coming because there is such a
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
shortage as there is everywhere are
 
04:11:26.809 --> 04:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
people enrolling in it or they're not
 
04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
enrolling it is it time to try something
 
04:11:33.130 --> 04:11:33.140 align:start position:0%
else that program is terrific
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
last year 37 graduates and degrees
 
04:11:40.130 --> 04:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
conferred and this year already 37 this
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
year 53 already conferred and that was
 
04:11:46.370 --> 04:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
just with one location offering the
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
program we're now at four and we'll have
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
five shortly the ability to scale that
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
program by 24 we'll be preparing roughly
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
a hundred graduates a year from that
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
program roughly half of the annual
 
04:12:01.809 --> 04:12:01.819 align:start position:0%
demand for LPNs in the state's Workforce
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
but it's also because of the way that
 
04:12:06.590 --> 04:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
program is structured it's a 12-month
 
04:12:08.929 --> 04:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
program but It prepares students who are
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
interested that they can step into the
 
04:12:13.969 --> 04:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
second year of an RN program if they
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
want to continue so and there are some
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
constraints on these programs because of
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
clinical placements and in in some ways
 
04:12:25.130 --> 04:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
if you lose a student in the first year
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
of an R A two-year RN program you've got
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
a you've got a gap it's like flying a
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
plane with an empty seat with the LPN
 
04:12:34.610 --> 04:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
program we can fill those spaces with
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
interested students who complete the
 
04:12:39.050 --> 04:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
one-year program so it makes both that
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
program successful but also makes our RN
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
programs that much more successful
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
on track again this year for probably
 
04:12:50.090 --> 04:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
between those two programs close to 300
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
nursing degrees to be conferred by the
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
community college system seven colleges
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the um one of the
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks that I always hold out with
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
why money sometimes is better spent at
 
04:13:04.969 --> 04:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
your level than up at that larger
 
04:13:04.979 --> 04:13:06.849 align:start position:0%
your level than up at that larger
Institution

04:13:06.849 --> 04:13:06.859 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
04:13:11.150 --> 04:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
is the the tremendous number of uh
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
graduates that stay in our state work in
 
04:13:16.570 --> 04:13:16.580 align:start position:0%
our state have families and contribute
 
04:13:20.809 --> 04:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
with that with that surge in LPNs can
 
04:13:23.150 --> 04:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
you tell me that many of those are
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
staying in our own state or where the
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
demand's so high everywhere else are
 
04:13:30.530 --> 04:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
leaving us I I did reach out last week
 
04:13:32.450 --> 04:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire influence security one
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
of the pieces of information we're
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get is better tracking on
 
04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
where our graduates are we know that 93
 
04:13:40.969 --> 04:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
percent of our students are from New
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a significant number who
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
are not from New Hampshire in the Upper
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
Valley you know they're on the Vermont
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
border and there's almost a permeability
 
04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
in terms of Workforce there North North
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
Country on the side with Maine so I
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
would say that the vast majority are
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
here now I can't tell you that we don't
 
04:14:02.570 --> 04:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
have some students who migrate south
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
because the wages in Massachusetts are
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
compelling but majority of our students
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
in fact two-thirds of our nursing
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
degrees are conferred to students who
 
04:14:13.130 --> 04:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
are 25 and older these are students who
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
already have lives in this community
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want to be commuters
 
04:14:17.929 --> 04:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
particularly if they've got families
 
04:14:20.330 --> 04:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
that make an hour and a half commute to
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
Boston area and not a good proposition
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm reasonably confident even without
 
04:14:28.729 --> 04:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
having access to perfect data that the
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
majority of our students are here and
 
04:14:33.170 --> 04:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
they're staying here and they're working
 
04:14:33.180 --> 04:14:34.130 align:start position:0%
they're staying here and they're working
here

04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:14:39.889 --> 04:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.290 --> 04:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:44.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
I would also like to request uh and uh
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
we have passed um the request along to
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
Chris Shea
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
um that uh lap State extensions
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you must have realized by now it's
 
04:15:07.729 --> 04:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
hard to get Consultants to finish jobs
 
04:15:11.290 --> 04:15:11.300 align:start position:0%
on time let alone bid them and then
 
04:15:14.809 --> 04:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
deliveries are just they keep getting
 
04:15:17.210 --> 04:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
fed back I have projects that just
 
04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
pulled the microphone a little closer to
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
you okay I have projects that
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
um we ordered a electric panel in August
 
04:15:28.250 --> 04:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
of this last year and they're telling me
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
the delivery date is July 25th the
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
project was supposed to be up and
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
running for some summer classes and I
 
04:15:40.130 --> 04:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
just deal with either that or rtus or or
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
just uh contractors not finding help I
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
would appreciate if we could get on page
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
nine the lap State extensions are listed
 
04:15:56.170 --> 04:15:56.180 align:start position:0%
for nineteen dollars and 21 dollars
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know fy21 and so um
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
without it just bring that to your
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
attention that we would like those
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
extended to give me one more shot at
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
spending finishing the projects that I
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
have the the
 
04:16:11.880 --> 04:16:13.070 align:start position:0%
have the the
um

04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:13.080 --> 04:16:14.410 align:start position:0%
um
budget

04:16:14.410 --> 04:16:14.420 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
routing for us is we finish the project
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
first then we build a state for the
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
dollars it's not encumbered to us when
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
we have a contract up front so we're out
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
out there with contracts that extend
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
beyond the date so it puts me in a
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
little bit of a bind so appreciate that
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay anything further yes representative
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you if I could just
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
comment on the third one the policy of
 
04:16:47.570 --> 04:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
the lapse team is to only remove
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
something if we are certain that the
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
contractors involved the project is
 
04:16:53.689 --> 04:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
finished the contractors are all paid
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh and that's not the case on the third
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
one so we would definitely leave that in
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
all all three of those um the the third
 
04:17:04.130 --> 04:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
one is actually two different critical
 
04:17:07.250 --> 04:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance line items but they're
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance and uh so we'll be
 
04:17:10.020 --> 04:17:11.269 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance and uh so we'll be
actually

04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
four different laws
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
that would apply to this I'm finishing
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
up like for instance the 17 I've I'll
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
have that gone the Littleton
 
04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
um mobile diesel ATL advanced technology
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
lab that's the State dollars will be
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
expended by June 30th on that one so
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
there's some that I'm finishing up I'm
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
not carrying everything forward it's
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.319 --> 04:17:46.130 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:17:46.130 --> 04:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:17:49.969 --> 04:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
um no further presentation
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
they um I just want to
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
make it known to you when I when I'm
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking for projects and what
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
priority there is no promise that
 
04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
something's coming from this side but in
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
the event we're able to squeeze a rock
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
and we're able to find something we know
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
um what your priorities are and and we
 
04:18:12.050 --> 04:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
will do our best
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that thank you very much
 
04:18:50.929 --> 04:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
just about done here excuse me hey um
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Chris really appreciate being
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
able to pull all these departments
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
together for us uh there was mention
 
04:19:04.610 --> 04:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
this morning by some of the members that
 
04:19:06.590 --> 04:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
um of course we're not here next week
 
04:19:08.689 --> 04:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
but the following week we come back in
 
04:19:10.450 --> 04:19:10.460 align:start position:0%
Earnest we're here Monday and Friday
 
04:19:13.729 --> 04:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
Friday was not in the budget or excuse
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
me it was not in the calendar
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
and I've come to find out that there was
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
a feeling that we may have a room
 
04:19:23.450 --> 04:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
conflict but we don't so they'll they'll
 
04:19:25.729 --> 04:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
put the rest of that in so you'll be
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
here Monday and Friday that week
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
and as I said before the beginning on
 
04:19:35.210 --> 04:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
Friday and they tend to move quickly
 
04:19:38.809 --> 04:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
um capital budget long range so we
 
04:19:40.250 --> 04:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
should be able to start pretty close to
 
04:19:40.260 --> 04:19:42.110 align:start position:0%
should be able to start pretty close to
time

04:19:42.110 --> 04:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
and on Friday the 10th we scheduled to
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
start at 10 30 to make sure we have
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
enough time for capital budget long
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
range to get done since it's all in this
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
room as well all right those two
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
meetings may take a little bit longer
 
04:19:57.050 --> 04:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
just because it's your organization
 
04:19:57.060 --> 04:19:58.729 align:start position:0%
just because it's your organization
meeting

04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and then there'll be a few items on
 
04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
each meeting right now capital budget
 
04:20:04.269 --> 04:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
overview I think has
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
three two or three action items in Long
 
04:20:10.370 --> 04:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
Range has I think up to four okay right
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
at the moment so today's the deadline
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
for agencies to get us stuff so we'll
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
start getting information next week on
 
04:20:16.140 --> 04:20:16.790 align:start position:0%
start getting information next week on
that

04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
um so the packets will go out next
 
04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
Thursday or Friday okay and we'll go out
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee members so you'll see
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
what's going to be on the agenda for the
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
following Friday thank you
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what you're hearing today
 
04:20:31.250 --> 04:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
and going forward so for instance
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
um you asked administrative services to
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
provide you with some information
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
additional information they'll come
 
04:20:38.570 --> 04:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
through me typically and then I'll
 
04:20:40.330 --> 04:20:40.340 align:start position:0%
forward that out to the committee so
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
you'll be getting emails from me uh
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the week as we get
 
04:20:46.370 --> 04:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
information from agencies that were
 
04:20:46.380 --> 04:20:47.809 align:start position:0%
information from agencies that were
requested

04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
requested
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
lastly at lunchtime I sent you all an
