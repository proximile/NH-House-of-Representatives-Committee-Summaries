00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:46.509 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
249. open the hearing for Hospital 249
 
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
for a non-germaine Amendment great
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm representative hunt representing
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
Ridge so what we have here
 
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 align:start position:0%
um is uh we had a we had a little mix up
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
and and I would say is this is one of
 
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 align:start position:0%
those Murphy's Law when things can go
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
wrong it it's amazing how it just goes
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
wrong again and the exact same problem
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
occurred the first time happens the
 
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
second time so
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately you don't have this
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
amendment yet where it turns out I was
 
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%
the only one who got it last night I
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
didn't think that it was going to happen
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to tell you what it is and
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
then we can uh obviously take it up in
 
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which we were going to do
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh this afternoon okay so no excuse me
 
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
it's insurance so it's tomorrow we'll
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
take up this amendment tomorrow so what
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
happened is we'll start out with last
 
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.250 align:start position:0%
happened is we'll start out with last
year

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
last year uh and when I would say last
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
year we passed something but it had been
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
an issue that's been around for many
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
many years which is can we allow dogs to
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
be on the porch of a restaurant
 
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
the way the bill came in originally was
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
only it was limited to only to Nanos and
 
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
obviously that's that was not going to
 
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
work that we want to make sure this is
 
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
available to any restaurant or anybody
 
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
who has an outside seating area that
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to have a dog on
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the dot on the deck
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
the reason why this issue had been
 
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
around so long and never been resolved
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
was because of service dogs
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the issue was that if you're going
 
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
to if that if you can have random pets
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
coming on this on the same place where
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
there might be a service dog there is a
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
potential of conflicts between the dogs
 
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
so over the years we've always never let
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
me say we've never passed we've always
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
struggled with this problem of the
 
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
service so part of the problems that was
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
solved by saying okay it's not inside
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
the restaurant it has to be outside the
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
restaurant it has to be someone who has
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
an out the restaurant or or obviously a
 
00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer or a nano has to
 
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
have an outside facility and and that's
 
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
where this dog's allowed and and then if
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
you read the statute you can see there
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
was lots of requirements about how they
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
can do this and how the dog has to
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to us when the Senate put
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment in and sent it over to us
 
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
they actually instead of just putting in
 
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
as a separate Standalone statute they
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
actually replaced a another law that was
 
00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
already on the books that's been on the
 
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
books for
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh give or take eight to ten years
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
ironically the sponsor I just saw him
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
downstairs he happens to be here
 
00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
representative Butler and uh what he he
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
had a bed and breakfast and
 
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and yes he has these
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
um Bernice big jumbo Bernese dogs and
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're very gentle but that it's a bed
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
and breakfast and they're in let's say
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bed and breakfast in the living room
 
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
there they don't go so they're in the
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
living room facility and the question is
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know are they barred from using
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
the uh use it being being there because
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
of the health code issues and let alone
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
the service dog issue
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
so at that time we didn't pass
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation and it was on the books and
 
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's been on the books for a fair amount
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
of years
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
then the Senate passed this other
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment this other statute which was
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
the loud dogs on the deck
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
but unbinosa everybody wasn't paying
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
attention we missed it was it replaced
 
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
attention we missed it was it replaced
it

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I realized that the amendment that
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
was initially sent out to everybody said
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh repeal and reenact which is exactly
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
what happened the last time
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
is that they repealed a paragraph and
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
put something else instead we don't want
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
that's not what I was trying to do with
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment what I'm trying to do
 
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
with this amendment is to Simply add the
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
statute back in so that we would still
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
have dogs can be on the deck
 
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
but we would also allow dogs to the
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
owner's dog to be in the facility
 
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
now this was brought to my attention by
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
representative below and blo has a very
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
simple Amendment which was let the dogs
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
be let them be there well that was fine
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's very simple that's very nice
 
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
however Jane you were not around for all
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the years that we had the problems of
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
this service dog and the health code
 
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
issues and so obviously I took your
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I sent it over to HHS who
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
are the ones who enforce it for
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
everybody who would not a city in town
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the states now and I
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
would say for uh for you said a few
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
members be aware that we do have a
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
little bit of a conflict in that cities
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and towns have their own code
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement health code enforcement you
 
00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
can ask me a question Jane okay
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards so uh that they had their own
 
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
code enforcement but in this case to
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
just unilaterally say that you can any
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
owner can have a dog it was there was a
 
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.450 align:start position:0%
owner can have a dog it was there was a
pushback

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
pushback
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
and I said so would you have a problem
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
if we just took the old statue that got
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
accidentally repealed and put that back
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
into the statute books and she said no
 
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
into the statute books and she said no
problem

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
they would be happy with that that's
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
what I attempted to do unfortunately on
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
the way to legislative Services it got
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
written wrong it got written as repeal
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
what we did last year and reenact so
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
this amendment you'll see adds a new
 
00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:54.650 align:start position:0%
this amendment you'll see adds a new
paragraph

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the statute so we will still have the
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
current law which is dogs allowed on the
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
deck but this would bring back the Old
 
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.949 align:start position:0%
deck but this would bring back the Old
Law

00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
Law
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
and put it in the statue in a different
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
place obviously and which will state
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
that a restaurant now owner can now have
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
a dog on their property
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
but they still have to comply and this
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
is the key thing Jane they have to
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
comply with all those other issues which
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
is it can't be in the kitchen or
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
production area it can't be you know it
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
has to be removed if a service dog shows
 
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
has to be removed if a service dog shows
up

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
we that that's what we're you know that
 
00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019 align:start position:0%
I guess that was one of the big rubs so
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
um theoretically there should not be any
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
problem with this new Amendment and I
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.949 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.949 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
question

00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between your
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment and my Amendment it's pretty
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
much the same thing your amendment has
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
one sentence
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
it is it it
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
it is already in the bill that was
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
passed last year the second section that
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
you put in the what I have is the first
 
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
sentence and the other sentences that
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
are there the next sentence is already
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was not repealed okay
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
so again if in terms of looking at the
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
two amendments the one that was sent out
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
versus the one that you just got just
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
now the key line difference is you'll
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
see what the RSA it's being changed to
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
you have to look above the paragraph and
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
look at the RSA change
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah it's 466.
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
colon 44.
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.110 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
two

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
okay and what's the other one say
 
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.410 align:start position:0%
okay and what's the other one say
three

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:11.420 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
not yours the other one that was under
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm so confused it leaves
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
Roman number two alone and adds Roman
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
numeral three so exactly thank you Mr
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
chairman any other questions
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's no spear
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
talk to the mic try to make sure the
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
I just have a very simple question with
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
all the words flying around yeah if
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
we're in a restaurant
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
and we're eating no dogs right
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes emphasize the restaurant except for
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
service dogs this this legislation would
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
allow that
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
um service dogs would be there this
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
legislation will allow the owner's dog
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
to be where we're eating in the
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant in the eating area
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant area and a sign has to
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
be displayed and the sign has to be
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
displayed before you walk in that
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
there's a dog there and that if a
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
service dog were to show up then that
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
dog needs to be removed
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
anything about how mannered the dog is I
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
mean some of these dogs
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I come from a house with dogs so
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a smell something I
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
walk in is that gonna am I gonna be
 
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.470 align:start position:0%
walk in is that gonna am I gonna be
attacked

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
attacked
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I worry about okay like I
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
say this was the law for for a long time
 
00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:38.899 align:start position:0%
it was eight or ten years it was law
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
that your the sign is on the door and
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
saying warning you that there this
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's a dog inside here and and the
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
sign would say is if you asked to have
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
that dog removed but in terms of your
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
concern is that and I I learned about
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
this because from my rental vacation
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
rentals it turns out to some that yes
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
there are some people who are incredibly
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
allergic to dogs and cannot come into
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
any space that a dog has actually been
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative Gibbs
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
for clarity
 
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.629 align:start position:0%
for clarity
um

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
people could still continue
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
to bring dogs into outdoor restaurant
 
00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:21.710 align:start position:0%
to bring dogs into outdoor restaurant
areas

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you what does it mean when you say
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
you have to remove the dog let's say
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
that there's an office that takes the
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
dog out of the eating areas that suffice
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's suffice okay but the key element
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
I would say they can't go into the
 
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.430 align:start position:0%
I would say they can't go into the
kitchen

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
but yes it would go into the owner's
 
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.370 align:start position:0%
but yes it would go into the owner's
office

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think we have uh one pink heart okay
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
and we'll call DJ Bettencourt from the
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department yeah
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
that's oh I'm sorry is there a card up
 
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
that's oh I'm sorry is there a card up
here

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
so these are the owners in Manchester
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
and all right could you state your names
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
for the record and if you could fill out
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
a pink card when you're done and we'll
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
have that in the record sure thing my
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
name is Aaron share
 
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.550 align:start position:0%
name is Aaron share
um

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
we are the owners of two share Brewing
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
Company in Manchester New Hampshire
 
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
Company in Manchester New Hampshire
um

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
we are in support of uh dogs being able
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
to be outside of restaurants and
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
breweries we think that's very important
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
um however uh we were notified by the
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
Manchester Health Department that our
 
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
Companion Animal our our dog was no
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
longer allowed inside the brewery with
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
us uh with the latest legislation that I
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe was passed in April of 2022 so
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to bring our
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
dog uh back into the brewery she is
 
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.060 align:start position:0%
integral to our company to our brand
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
our customers love her
 
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.389 align:start position:0%
our customers love her
um

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
she is the face of our brand and right
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
now our mascot is not allowed in the
 
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.870 align:start position:0%
now our mascot is not allowed in the
brewery

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
brewery
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to add uh yeah I
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
mean we adopted blue three years ago
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
knowing she was a rescue dog and that we
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
would be able to have her with us and so
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
I don't think we probably would have
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
adopted her if we had known that we
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
would have to leave her home alone we
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
are at the brewery a lot it is our
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and so it has definitely had an
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
impact on our customers on us on our
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
business and on blue
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
all right questions from the committee
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs um just a quick
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
question same question I asked
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative terminal before if a
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
service dog came in I presume you have a
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
place you could put the dog in an office
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
or something she has a crate
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
in uh in a separate room that we would
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative billio yeah thank you
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for participating in democracy
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
and good luck thank you
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%

time I asked for which was two minutes
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%

department I'm joined by Emily Doherty

my colleague at the department we have
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
no position on the amendment other than
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
we would say good luck figuring out how
 
00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
to find the right balance but what we
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
would say perhaps plead is to not do
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to endanger the
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
underlying bill which is a very
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
important bill to the department and we
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%

Protection in New Hampshire

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
amendment is very important so keep that
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%

okay

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:14.270 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a bill that I would say
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh on the face of it is potentially a 10
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
10 bill
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
a 10 10 bill 1010 in other words it
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be the commit
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would start by saying is
 
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
there any Democrat who wants to pass
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay now is there any Republican who
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the bill is quite ready
 
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.990 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the bill is quite ready
but

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I think there's Merit to it so
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
there's a an executive order from the
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
governor governor that covers the
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
executive branch correct and this bill
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
would add the other branches of the
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
government to sort of be a mop up right
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
right so you know I think there's
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
growing concern over how much China has
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
a fusion economy it's the military
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
controls yes all of its industry and so
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
any any products that we buy from China
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
could potentially have back doors that
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
it you know it gives China an advantage
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
um but it's a difficult thing to police
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I mean a microwave
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
are there any microwaves still being
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
made in the United States
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
so so you're an old microwave is a dull
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
microwave but new microwave is a smart
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
microwave that's connected to the
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
internet and then potentially
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
essentially could tell that Chinese or
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
tell what you're eating
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm saying I mean it's uh
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Chinese economy is so
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
embedded in our manufacturing that it's
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
hard how does the state how is the state
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
ever I mean you would need an exemption
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
for that I guess so it has to be
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I mean you have to somehow narrow it
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the governor did in
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
his order
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
that how did how did the governor deal
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
with the microwave does anybody know
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative field you have a comment
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the definition of owned in the bill
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
is too ambiguous to be able to legislate
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
what does owned mean does own mean a one
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
percent stake in a company such that a
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
publicly owned company that is traded on
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
the NYSC that has one share that is
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
owned by uh China or the uh the People's
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
Republic of China is now an own company
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
uh because of that reason it's
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
inexperience of legislate because the
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
definition of owned is is nebulous
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and I also think that there's a
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
potential supremacy clause issues in
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
this as well that Foreign Relations is
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
exclusively reserved to the federal
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
government and this potentially Treads
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
upon the federal government's right to
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
engage in foreign relations uh because
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
it engages in a supremacy clause issue
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
that is reserved to federal government
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
we should also find the new experience
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative wall should
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
you asked
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
you asked what the governor did I think
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
it was specifically about Tick Tock it
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't about Manufacturing
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
it was specifically for tick tock I
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
believe wasn't it
 
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:15.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we got we had right
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
you want to read it well it looks too
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
long to read give us the highlight
 
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.490 align:start position:0%
long to read give us the highlight
foreign

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
this is from Governor's uh
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh sir nunu
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the date but anyway uh now
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
therefore Christopher sununu I do okay
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
to preserves the safety security and

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess that solves the microwave
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem because they've used narrowly
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
used doing computer technology so
 
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.710 align:start position:0%

I'd like to make a motion to retain okay
 
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.909 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to retain okay
okay

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
I think I think retaining is fine John
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question yes representative
 
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.310 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question yes representative

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
spear
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
man can I ask
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
you no you this is
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
the dod has spent a fortune
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I've worked in this kind of stuff uh
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
figuring out what they can allow on
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
their networks and in their equipment
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
they do not ban products per se they ban
 
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.950 align:start position:0%
they do not ban products per se they ban
chips

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
chips
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
If the product does not have specific
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
chips in it and they list those chips
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
they tell you what they are
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
then you can't have it anywhere in a DOD
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
product that doesn't mean you can't have
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
it in your house
 
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:55.700 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
broadly Banning whole products without
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
looking at see what it's in what's in
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
them and what they're used for is doing
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
a disservice to our our state
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
I agree and that's why we should retain
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:30:12.480 --> 00:31:21.490 align:start position:0%
this bill
okay

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
so the question is I'm sorry put hit the
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
red button
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is already covered by Federal
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
Executive law
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
in federal yeah I thought Federal was
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense foreign
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
did it include state
 
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.730 align:start position:0%
did it include state
agencies

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
probably have laws of what they allow on
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
there and just as we don't know do we
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
really want to go through this for the
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
next week or two I'd say let's just
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
retain this bill we could work over it
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
over the summer and then come win next
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
fall we'll have a better answer to
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether this is is really an issue or
 
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.409 align:start position:0%
whether this is is really an issue or
not

00:32:11.409 --> 00:32:11.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
but I'm not on this committee so okay
 
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
but I'm not on this committee so okay
okay

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative until
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that we should probably kill
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
this one because no matter what we do
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
with this one we're never going to be
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
able to massage it into something that's
 
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.470 align:start position:0%
able to massage it into something that's
salvageable

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
salvageable
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
that the better approach would be a
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
company-based approach such as what we
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
had on the governor's order because no
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
matter what we're dealing with a foreign
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
country in this and we can't do that as
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
a state because of the supremacy clauses
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
I understand yep so kill this bill
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
because of the supremacy clause issue
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
come back take a company-based approach
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
which is the better wiser way to go
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
which is what doe e does but
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
we can't name a foreign country in the
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill because that's you know one way of
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
looking at is we're teetering on a
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
declaration of war there and I don't
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
think we want to do that either kill
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
all right so I I uh Jackson's not here
 
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
all right so I I uh Jackson's not here
okay

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
how badly do you feel we should hold on
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
my routine motion is a courtesy to uh
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
um and I I think he would like to
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
well let's look at your ranking Democrat
 
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.860 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee representative
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay and Herbert wants to kill it so the
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
Democrats all want to kill it and we
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
have at least one Republican who wants
 
00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:02.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
is missing today
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay uh so uh the subcommittee wants uh
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
is itl
 
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.930 align:start position:0%
is itl
but

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
he has okay you want to re rehash the
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
Rich do you have opinions about the
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:49.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have to turn the mic on and
 
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
I do uh none that I want to share right
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.810 align:start position:0%
at the moment
okay

00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay well uh all right so
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right now on to the next one uh uh
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
two two five this I have my notes is
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
currency prohibition but this the
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
prohibition is against
 
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
prohibition is against
using

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
this is the Central Bank digital
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
currency yeah
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I just assumed get rid of it I mean
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not this issue is going to
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
come back
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay so but the question I have is is
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
this is this is uh Banning a certain
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
currency so if the federal government
 
00:37:54.849 --> 00:37:54.859 align:start position:0%
came out with uh their own
 
00:37:54.859 --> 00:37:56.890 align:start position:0%
came out with uh their own
cryptocurrency

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:56.900 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's okay would it it's there if they
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
came up with some kind of their own kind
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
of currency or so it's
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
digital currency yeah so
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of this bill is to
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
address the idea of a central bank
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
digital currency which is
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's similar to a
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency but it's it's maybe not
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's digital but it's controlled by
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
the Central Bank okay
 
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.050 align:start position:0%
the Central Bank okay
um

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I don't know if this bill
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
is workable in its current form but I
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
think that issue is going to keep coming
 
00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:35.150 align:start position:0%
think that issue is going to keep coming
back

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.930 align:start position:0%
back
um

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of privacy it's an issue
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
of being able to
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
influence people's decisions their
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
economic decisions
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
governments all around the world are
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
looking into doing this
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we can ban it
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
outright but we can certainly allow for
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
a competition to to happen
 
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.089 align:start position:0%
a competition to to happen
um

00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's definitely an issue that this
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee should get up to speed on
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
so it's worth it just to keep it around
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
to so we can have a conversation about
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
it or something or that would that would
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
be my preference okay it's up to the
 
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.710 align:start position:0%
be my preference okay it's up to the
committee

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
again I think we're actually running
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
into a supremacy clause issue here we
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to regulate
 
00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:18.349 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to regulate
currency

00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
well but this case is
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't have the power to
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
dictate anything to the Federal Reserve
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's what confused me about
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
this this is the federal government is
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
going to create this currency well if
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve is is a private
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's right it's a separate entity
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
right but it is it's a partially owned
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
entity by the federal government I think
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're running into a catch-22 here but
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't have the power to
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
regulate currency particularly if it's a
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
currency that's minted by the US
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
government and if we're talking about
 
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:50.060 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin here which is
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a currency this is not that has
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with Bitcoin because
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
Bitcoins currency yeah is to try to go
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
after cryptos which themselves are not
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
currency they're uh blockchain let's
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
call it blockchain they were saying the
 
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
digital would be blockchain
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
but whatever whatever currencies they're
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
going after here we don't have the power
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
to regulate the currency doesn't exist
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
yet what this is addressing yeah but
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
governments all around the world are
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
talking about this issue essential Bank
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
digital currency would it's not probably
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
not blockchain but we don't have much we
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to regulate
 
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.010 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to regulate
currency

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
does the state have
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
the state does not have the power to
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
regulate a currency that if the if the
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
US government were to create a currency
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
that for some reason were to have a
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
digital currency that were trackable
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have the power as a state to
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
say we're not accepting a national
 
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.630 align:start position:0%
say we're not accepting a national
currency

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
currency
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
so I disagree again we could say that
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know we'll accept the existing
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
currency but okay so this again my notes
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
in my memory my thing this is going to
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
be a 10 10. you know okay so while we
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
well how do I know that yeah okay is
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
there any Democrat who wants to pass
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
this bill oh hell no that's how I know
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
that what about
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's the next question I'll ask is
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
there any Republican who would not
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
support an expedient to legislate on
 
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:20.660 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would be opposed to retaining it Mr
 
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.130 align:start position:0%
that would be opposed to retaining it Mr
Sherman

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
Sherman
 
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.630 align:start position:0%
Sherman
retain

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
retain uh yeah yes or no retain I would
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
we are doing this is a subcommittee this
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
is a straw poll and we're getting a
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
feeling of the subcommittee
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is one that I would
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually like to retain because of the
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
open question of law of what power does
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
the state have over a currency
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think it might be something
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
interesting to ask doj as to or at least
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
doj you know actually advisory opinion
 
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
would be really interesting do we have
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
any power over currency
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I I think this is a I I agree with
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Ammons but he said
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
earlier it's not clear that we don't
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
have some abilities here and this is an
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
issue that's going to keep coming back
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
to us and coming back to us I mean money
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
and banking is a big part of my world
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
and part of my experience in education
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we don't keep this
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
around in some form we're just going to
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
have to deal with we're going to need to
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
learn to deal with this in the next four
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
or five years so it's we can we can get
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
rid of it today but it's coming back so
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
might as well keep it okay
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
I did a calculation and I figured out
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
how much money comes into the state from
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's and that includes 30 percent of the
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
entire Revenue that comes into the state
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
comes from federal grants the total in
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
my estimation based on Medicare Medicaid
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh salaries and everything else comes
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
out to 8.28 billion dollars a year
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
so before we think about even thinking
 
00:42:57.359 --> 00:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
so before we think about even thinking
about

00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
doing something to some currency coming
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
from the federal government we are going
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
to wipe out this state if we try to do
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's 8.28 billion
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
dollars a year coming from the federal
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
government and we have no indication
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
that they intend to generate a currency
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's even going to do any of this fair
 
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:20.420 align:start position:0%
enough okay
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
so uh representative gives I I
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you would like to enter
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
in but we will be taking that actually
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
we'll be taking this up in the exact
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
session and then I would ask you to hold
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
your comments to them because right now
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
we have the subcommittee and I do have a
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
sense that the subcommittee is willing
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs what would you like
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to uh support
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative filio that I think we're
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
treading on the edge of the supremacy
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
clause here
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and that that can be a serious legal
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
problem and also uh representative spear
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we're treading uh uh seriously on
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
doing serious damage to both the state
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of New Hampshire and we
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
we need to be really careful about those
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
things fair enough
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative uh amen
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Cole moves to
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill 225. those are the
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee who are in
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
support of that motion please raise your
 
00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:32.780 align:start position:0%
hand one
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
two three
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
four to retain it five to retain
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
all right fine six
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
00:44:44.359 --> 00:44:45.950 align:start position:0%
those opposed
one

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.150 align:start position:0%
one
two

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
all right moving right along uh
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh Financial uh H Bill 227 I'm calling
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
this financial discrimination good point
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
so on on the Facebook I would think this
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
is a retained bill which one face of it
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
but I understand so while I'm interested
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
here is for somebody who would be
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to retain uh versus and in terms
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
Democrats would be itl
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans would be
 
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.410 align:start position:0%
Republicans would be
OTP

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
but the retain is the compromise because
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
we don't want to send a bill to the
 
00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:50.099 align:start position:0%
house floor 10 to 10 and take up
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's time to debate a an issue
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is never going to get solved on
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.290 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
you really want to go through a vote of
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
itl versus the retained yeah just go to
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
um yes I do this this this vote a very
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
similar bill in every public and
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
controlled uh North Dakota lost 90 to
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
three this is a terrible bill it's
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
unenforceable it's totally anti uh
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
business and and it it ain't the Dem it
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
ain't the New Hampshire way it you you
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
simply cannot enforce this type of Bill
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
that's your opinion that's my opinion
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
right and I I got more to go on that
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
well here's here was the question is
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
is there some way you could write it
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
is there some way you could write it to
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
assure that businesses are not being
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
is there a way you could write it this
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh not discriminating
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
against businesses was last year's bill
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
this is not discriminating against
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
individuals let me give you an example
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a banker and somebody comes to me
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
and says I want to invest in real estate
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh in the on the shores of of uh of
 
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.770 align:start position:0%
uh in the on the shores of of uh of
Florida

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
where you might have hurricanes you
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
might have flooding whatever if I say no
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
if I violated this bill in other words I
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
can't take into account the fact that
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
there might be a hurricane or might or
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
the sea may rise because that's uh
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
climate involved this bill if I did that
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is a stupid investment to do in
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
the first place I'd be violating this
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
Bill how are you going to enforce that
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
is that discrimination that's not
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination at all that's that's it
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
if if you don't take into account things
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
like climate change or or other things
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh in your Investments uh you're you're
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
not doing a good job and and I hate to
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
tell people this but ESG is not the
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
boogeyman that people think it is nor is
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
it designed to basically uh put in a
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
whole new green world it's none of that
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's simply a business decision
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's a business decision that allows
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
investors who've been doing this all
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
along ESG the term this is not the ESG
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
build this is about a bank giving a loan
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's to a person or a business
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing it's it's all in
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
this big ESG I have to admit it's
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
someone who has known ESG for over 20
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
years because I sit on a Family
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
Foundation I don't remember guns being
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
an issue 20 years ago
 
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
it was at guns for instance
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
that was not an ESG issue
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's now evidently an ESG issue but it
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't back then correct and neither was
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
climate change back then uh for though
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
we go climate change has been around all
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
this time well I could say someone who
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
sat on an ESG evaluation I remember what
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
was on and what was not on and yeah so
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is this is clearly a
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
10-10 vote yeah
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay so why do we want to pursue this do
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
you really want to go through this we're
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
10 10. Let's Be Be Happy
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
that we're not passing anything
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
which we did last year
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
1010 means
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
we are divided politically
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
this is oh this is a totally political
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill in my mind and so therefore that's
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
that's not waste
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
the floors time are you know let's try
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be efficient with our time and let's
 
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180 align:start position:0%
just go to retained and move on I I
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully think that that's exactly
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
the reason we should itl this bill but
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
it ain't going to get it out
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 10 10 and it's going to
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
do you want that no I don't want it to
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.370 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
prediction if you want to have a quote
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
let's have a vote
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
and if it's if it comes out 4-4 I'm just
 
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.370 align:start position:0%
and if it's if it comes out 4-4 I'm just
saying

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm making an assumption about when I
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
look at a bill and I can see that it's
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
clearly a political bill and if you not
 
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.970 align:start position:0%
clearly a political bill and if you not
everybody

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:51.980 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
I hear that and then and we've been
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
we've already been flexible on Two Bills
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
already that we heard two different
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
opinions that we had people on other
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
parties say no John
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Cole's head he wanted to
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
kill that bill
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
right but I just want to move the
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
process along here okay so if you want
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
to keep you know go through Protestant
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
vote we did
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
you know we can go through a vote so
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer second it
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
whatever that's what I'm saying you're
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to make a vote we'll make a vote
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative macular second by
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert moves in
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate representative
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
feel it is recognized to speak to the
 
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.069 align:start position:0%
feel it is recognized to speak to the
motion

00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we had a motion yet I've
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
just made it okay representative McAleer
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
second by representative Herbert moves
 
00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:41.339 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate uh I guess I
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
have two points here first is that we
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
are a very divided house that we are 201
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
to 190 X
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
which means that they are the people of
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
the state in their wisdom have said that
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
we are going to be coming out with very
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
closely divided votes and that we have
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
had a number of bills that have already
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
come to the house floor as 10 tens with
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
no committee recommendation that we
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
haven't had many bills that have come
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
out of this committee yet but it's
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
inevitable that we're going to have 10
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
tens out of this committee it's okay
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
we're a closely divided house and the
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
people the state said that's what they
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
want it's it's fine now with regards to
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I just have a question for
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
those who are in support of it how is
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
this not a violation of the Free Speech
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
Clause given that the U.S Supreme Court
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
has said that spending is speech that is
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court has said
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
how is telling a financial institution
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
that they have to spend in a particular
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
manner not a violation of something that
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court has unequivocally
 
00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:44.569 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court has unequivocally
said

00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
this speech how is this not a violation
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
of the Free Speech clause
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
so I I just I'm
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
be prank it I I thought we got over this
 
00:52:57.609 --> 00:52:57.619 align:start position:0%
but well I'll re
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
from what I believe okay and that yes
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
we are closely divided house yes this
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
committee is 10 10. and I think that we
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
will do a disservice
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
to the house and to everyone if we get
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
into a political debate on every one of
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
these clearly political bills
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I feel that the best thing for this
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
committee to do is pass those things
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
which the vast majority of because we
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
know there's some bills that we're never
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to have everybody is going to
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
agree to but if the vast majority of us
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
can agree on an issue and have that Bill
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
come out of committee and go on the
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
consent calendar or go on the regular
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
calendar then I think we're doing or the
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
house a favor and I think we're doing
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
our constituents what they really want I
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
don't think they want us to get bogged
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
down on political debates and political
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
issues they just want us to do our the
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
people's business get things done do
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
them right and you get political bills
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
which clearly you Democrats might not
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
like and believe you me when we get to
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
Tomorrow there's a bunch of bills that
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
we Republicans don't like
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
so the best thing to do is if it's going
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
to be political is for us not to pass it
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
and that's to retain it we'll have this
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion again in November
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
when it has to go to the floor again
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
but I am urging everyone to consider
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
this John Hunt rule
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
I'll call it what it is Jane the John
 
00:54:36.609 --> 00:54:36.619 align:start position:0%
Hunt rule that is
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
I am absolutely a chair that can
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
actually be dictating if you want to
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
call it dictating that's fine you can
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
say you're opposed to the John Hunt rule
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
the John Hunt rule should be that we
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
want bills we want bills we don't want
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
to send anything 10 10. we want every
 
00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:55.940 align:start position:0%
what comes out of this committee is
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
uniformly overwhelmingly in support of
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
it and if it doesn't have that
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
uniformity if it doesn't you know you
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
know we don't want a floor debate over
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
some Nuance of something that just takes
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
up a lot of time it really is not
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to every anybody because all it
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
does is get everybody to do their
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
political positioning and let's just
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
pass good legislation that we all can
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
agree on or most of us can agree on
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
except maybe the marijuana bill just a
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
if we retain it and we take it up in the
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
fall yes does it eventually have to go
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
to the floor it would go to the floor
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
and my recommendation would be interim
 
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.069 align:start position:0%
and my recommendation would be interim
study

00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
oh so it could stay there forever it
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
stays in committee and it never has to
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
get enacted it never has to be debated
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
wait a minute house floor except if you
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
wanted somebody once somebody wants to
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
fight that motion right but that's the
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
John Hunt rule that John I'm asking you
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
can call it a rule all right I'm asking
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
this as a favor
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay rather than a ruling is that and
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
I've talked to you just it's not like
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
you this is the first time you've heard
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay you would rather have the tent you
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
well that's the point of the
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is for us so we weed that
 
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.490 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is for us so we weed that
out

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we have a pending motion
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Saxon
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I wanna
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
comment on the role
 
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:41.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good rule because
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
everything's political I mean this is
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature wow
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
um the and the point of this is It's a
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
management decision let's get all this
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm hearing you say
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
we there's a whole bunch of stuff here
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we are never going to agree on
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of stuff here that
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
we might agree on and there's a whole
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff that we clearly agree on
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
so if we take all the stuff we clearly
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
agree on and move that out the door
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
then we can come back and work on the
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
maybe stuff and then we can come back to
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
the never stuff but you're doing this
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
committee a favor because you're
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
clearing the docket and you're doing the
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
legislature body across the street a
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
favor because we can send them the stuff
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
that everybody can act on and be in
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
concert in so I think it's a very good
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
plan a good way to manage the committee
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
if you care
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's well stated yes
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
representative Evan
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
thank you just a little history and this
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
is my recollection but I think it's
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
accurate we passed a similar Bill last
 
00:57:48.599 --> 00:57:49.549 align:start position:0%
accurate we passed a similar Bill last
year

00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate turned it into a study
 
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.790 align:start position:0%
the Senate turned it into a study
committee

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
in their study committee bill they said
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the first named member of the Senate
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
calls the first meeting and then they
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
never named a member so the study
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee never happened so watch out
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
for that trick by the the Senate
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and so I think
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh that kind of speaks to retaining it
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
and allowing it to uh breathe a little
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
bit and maybe so this issue is a topical
 
00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:19.790 align:start position:0%
bit and maybe so this issue is a topical
issue

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:22.940 align:start position:0%
um in Washington DC the ESG
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
the the President Biden Administration
 
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.190 align:start position:0%
the the President Biden Administration
uh

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
put in put rules in place through the
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
labor department that funds could
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
consider ESG and the house shot it down
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
and the Senate also shot it down
 
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.970 align:start position:0%
and the Senate also shot it down
uh

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
and and two Democrats went with the
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
Republicans to to
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
shoot that rule down this bill isn't
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
exactly like what just happened in DC
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
but the the the topic is current
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
um and President Biden will likely veto
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
that that attempt but it's this is a
 
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
topical issue
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative mackler you want to
 
00:59:02.819 --> 00:59:05.569 align:start position:0%
representative mackler you want to
comment

00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's a mistake to to retain this
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
bill there's nothing about it that makes
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
sense it's anti-conservative it's
 
00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.670 align:start position:0%
sense it's anti-conservative it's
anti-business

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
anti-business
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to take the chance
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
that this could get to the house and
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
actually pass
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
because of politics and that's you're
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
correct that's all this is is a
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
political Bill and and it's if you take
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
the politicalness out of it it's a
 
00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and and this is the time for you to
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
express those opinions yes
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
okay do you still want to take the vote
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
on in itl okay the vote the motion is in
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate representative
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
McAleer said by representative Herbert
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of uh in experience
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
to legislate please raise your hand
 
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.270 align:start position:0%
to legislate please raise your hand
one

00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:01.220 align:start position:0%
two three
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
and okay and all those are
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
what we're doing no you're not no you're
 
01:00:07.559 --> 01:00:09.170 align:start position:0%
what we're doing no you're not no you're
not

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
no okay what I learned from my
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
experience last week itl means it can go
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
to the floor and get voted on and that's
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
where we're going to lose if we put it
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
in the in is as an in uh what do you
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
call it if we retain it it doesn't go to
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
the floor and that's what I want I don't

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Spears moves
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%

all those in favor please raise your
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%

now those opposed
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
all right so the Commerce Committee has
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
historically killed this bill
 
01:01:23.339 --> 01:01:25.309 align:start position:0%
historically killed this bill
uh

01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
every time well actually you haven't
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
killed it we there have been a time and
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
I can even in this case where it was put
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
in by a Republican and she asked me to
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
let's please don't kill it you know let
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
me study on it and we did some more
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
study on it we kept it we kept it around
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day this bill has
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
never passed out of this committee
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
so is there anybody now I'm going to ask
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
for consensus so is there anybody who
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
it would could potentially be unanimous
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
well there goes your theory no I'm
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
saying it's uh that's true but in this
 
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
case the sponsor was a Republican
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
oh so then it's okay no I'm just I'm
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
just I'm using that as a test of how
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
political a bill is I don't know what to
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
do but
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
so but uh if if you think we should
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
who wants to retain so if we're going to
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
use representative Herbert you wouldn't
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
really want to train it
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
we'll put you in charge of the study
 
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.390 align:start position:0%
we'll put you in charge of the study
committee

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
how have you voted on this bill over the
 
01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
how have you voted on this bill over the
years

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:58.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
so we had one of the biggest in the
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
world you're supposed to use the mic
 
01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:05.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody in in New Hampshire
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
well I I just want to point out that uh
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
let's be close to it the Reconstruction
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
Finance Corporation was the largest
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
banking uh Bank in uh America during the
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
new deal because it funded it and after
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
World War II it was the largest bank in
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
the world
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it was a national socialist bank so
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
are you speaking for this this is no
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%

we'll be right along
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh 5 20.
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
so the last time we discussed this bill
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
the hang up representative Ammon was on
 
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.170 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
minus the one percent that's the name of
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
it the number oh it's uh 64. we had an
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
amendment is that what happened we had
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
an amendment on this one
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah because I see the way I sponsored
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
it it's different the way it was
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
so uh
okay

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:22.490 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
do we do I have the amendment
 
01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.089 align:start position:0%
do we do I have the amendment
uh

01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:28.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
Kristen do we have the amendment on
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
what's this bill number to 520
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment of The I must
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
no no I didn't understand I would it
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
would I would have taken it to
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislative services do we ever do an
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
amendment on 520
 
01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:49.069 align:start position:0%
amendment on 520
uh

01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay it's not listed here what why did I
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
feel like we had something
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
you you gave us a handout
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah unfortunately I left my paperwork
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
upstairs so I I I uh so
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
so some people have it right so we have
 
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
I this is why we keep producing this is
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
why we keep it too sick around okay
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right so this what this did was it
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
changed it
 
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.970 align:start position:0%
changed it
um

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going the deposit is not
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
required to pay such interest at a rate
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
in excess of 0.5 percent per year and
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
the depository Bank shall not pay such
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
interest a rate less than point five
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
percent per year
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay and so you
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we're entering into a period of high
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
interest rates and we're capping it at
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
half a percent interest by Statute So
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
currently the banking Department sets
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
that interest rate
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
um to me that seems like an arbitrary
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
number and difficult to explain to our
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
constituents why we're
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know the lower range is probably the
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
more accurate which is a 0.05 percent I
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
understand these these accounts don't
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know are worked for the bank and
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
that people shouldn't expect
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh the savings rate but
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not comfortable with an arbitrary
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
range in in statute that's that would be
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
my objection
 
01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
so this sentence that notwithstanding
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
before going the depository bank is not
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
required to pay such interest at a rate
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
in excess of 0.5 percent so that means
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
they have to pay if if we were back to
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
the period where I had no interest right
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
where we were negative they still have
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
to pay a half a percent is that what
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
which one's the upper and then but the
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
bank shall not interest rate less than
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
right 0.05
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:05.450 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
so that there's a bond so there was a
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
so you're you're one more apt to bump up
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
against that and it would get bump up
 
01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:17.660 align:start position:0%
against it
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
so legislating almost zero percent
 
01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:27.709 align:start position:0%
so legislating almost zero percent
altogether

01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
do I have no don't have the top or
 
01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.590 align:start position:0%
do I have no don't have the top or
bottom

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me is that in the amendment yeah
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
so then the amendment that was handed
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I'm sure I sent it over the
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
legislative so probably sitting over in
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.719 --> 01:08:55.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
what what's wrong with the original Bill
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
where it says at a rate no lower than
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
the highest Target federal funds well
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
the problem with the original if you
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
were here for the hearing the problem of
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
the original bill is that um it it's a
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
lot of work for the banking Department
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
to to no avail at this point but that
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
that they have to keep calculating it so
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
they were trying to do trying to
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
simplify it
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh so you you would be okay with having
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
your your rental deposit not earning any
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
interest in when we were if we were
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
okay so for the parties and interest if
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
we removed both the floor and the cap
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
we could live with that
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we will have
 
01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:55.580 align:start position:0%
um Amendment drawn up for uh next week
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
and which will have no no floor or cap
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that then yeah okay it
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
would just be striking that line no well
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it would be back to whatever just
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
right your visit go ahead and for
 
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself so some people might
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
not know that you're the bank
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner my name is Amelia galduri
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the bank commissioner for the State
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so my recommendation
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
is just to take the amendment and
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
eliminate the last sentence that will
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the floor and recap the floor
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
in the cap if you go back to the other
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
one it'll change the rate altogether
 
01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.890 align:start position:0%
one it'll change the rate altogether
that'll

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
that'll
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
reignite everything right but we you
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
will that so the key Chris
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
the key thing is they that after the
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
amendment the original bill was put in
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
that you and I sponsored that the
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
parties were involved and negotiated
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
this new new system that is going to
 
01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:53.060 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy in terms of
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
implementing the statute
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay but that this um but the Caps
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you know when having a floor
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
and a cap was problematic representative
 
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.470 align:start position:0%
and a cap was problematic representative
Gibbs

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
the rate would be set by the banking
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
commissioner correct thank you
 
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
so it would be set by the statute right
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
that ties it to a predictable rate
 
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.610 align:start position:0%
that ties it to a predictable rate
currently

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
in one section of the bank commission
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
sets it and in another section it's tied
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
to a different rate so this would have
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
the good effect of making it all the
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
same rate less administrative burden
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
um that goal would be uniform uniform
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
and less perfect
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative action
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
well I'm curious because you you said
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
something to representative Herbert
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
about uh the interest paid on his rental
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
deposits there's nothing in this bill
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
that I see this applies only to escrows
 
01:11:59.649 --> 01:11:59.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is only this is only a mortgage
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
right mortgage issue which which in my
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a it's a it's an
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
awkward position because you know some
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
banks require you to uh you know to do
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
the monthly payments on on your mortgage
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
and your uh for your in your taxes right
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
the big things the taxes you know
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
property taxes so you know the fact that
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
they require you know then well you're
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
loaning them ten thousand dollars a year
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
at zero you were ABS I would I can only
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
imagine that they are actually well the
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
problem with it is it goes up and down
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
twice a year correct because we died
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
twice a year right that's in taxes yeah
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
so okay so uh representative just uh
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
remind me that is we because we have it
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
scheduled for exec tomorrow and if there
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
is a general agreement from this
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that that's what we would
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
go for it I will have the amendment
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
drawn up so so that maybe we might not
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
have to meet the following week if we
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
can get this this resolved
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion would be uh is is
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
this committee is a straw vote is this
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee okay with the proposed banking
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh by uh but with striking the
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
last sentence
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'll make a out to pass
 
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
recommendation on it with the amendment
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
and get that out of the way now okay
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative macular seconded by
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
um makes this motion of this proposal
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Herbert speak to the
 
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
yes representative Herbert speak to the
motion

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
the great will actually be
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know uh can you tell us what it
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
apologize I did not look at it before we
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
came here but it is set if you if you
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
look on this um
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
the FDIC website it is set on the
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
website like you can go look at it I
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
didn't look at it before the meeting
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
should you have your computer right open
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
and it's periodically you can go back in
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
time and look at it over time it's very
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
consistently set that's what we really
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
wanted uh good morning all Todd Wells
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
Chief examiner with the Department I did
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
a little research on this particular
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
index it's the national rates as set by
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
the Federal Deposit Insurance
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
Corporation I looked back historically
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
on their website to ascertain what the
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
range of those rates were over the last
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
several years the data that I saw
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
published went back to 2009 so just for
 
01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:43.699 align:start position:0%
an example there was a range of around
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
0.20 percent in 2009 and then I just for
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
purposes of our own consideration and
 
01:14:50.169 --> 01:14:50.179 align:start position:0%
discussion internally at the department
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
went right through to current so when I
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
looked at this maybe a month ago in
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
early 2023 the listed rate was a 0.33
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
percent and I will add that that was
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
actually the highest that I saw in those
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
intervening years between 2009 and 2023
 
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:10.340 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
so the FDIC is your uh
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
Beacon as to what you're going to
 
01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
Beacon as to what you're going to
okay

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
so it would be the index yeah so the the
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
FDIC tracks I believe they developed
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
um yes is the national rate for savings
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
and there's there's a bit of a back
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
story I'm happy to discuss why that's
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
important and why there's likely going
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
to be some longevity to this index it's
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
very important from the standpoint of
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
the FDIC as an insurer
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
but it is a consistently set the goal
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
was to tie it to an index that the
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
industry and the consumers like it was a
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
big compromise to find this index that
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
seemed like the right compromise rate
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
um to protect consumers but also
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
encourage a vibrant um financial sector
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
um whatever the rate is this is
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
um as an insurance agency FDIC is
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're concerned with the uh
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
um uh what's the what I'm looking at the
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
security of these these deposits uh so I
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
would the the biggest concern as I would
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
interpret it from the FDIC keeping in
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
mind that the Federal Deposit Insurance
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
Corporation ensures deposits and when
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if there's a failure of an insured
 
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:47.540 align:start position:0%
bank they basically have to step in in a
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
conservation role to either liquidate
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
those assets and and or have the another
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
institution assume that the assets and
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the liabilities right purchase the
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
assets and assume the liabilities so one
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
of the concerns would be as you can
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
imagine so the the federal Regulators as
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
this also the state Regulators we're
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
very concerned with capital capitalist
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
the protection it's the rainy day fund
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
the ability to margin growth a cushion
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
to absorb losses
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
a financial institution that is in
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
trouble maybe has some solvency issues
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
has some other asset quality issues
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
basically some safety and soundness
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
concerns the FDIC does not want to have
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
a situation where that institution can
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
go out and just try to raise more funds
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
they might have a liquidity crisis so
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
they would want to raise more deposits
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
what's a great way to do that a great
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
way to do that is to raise rates to pay
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
more than their competitors and those
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds would come would come rushing in
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
the FDIC sets this rate because the big
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
reason that they track it and monitor it
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
is because they they have rules and
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
regulations that basically would inhibit
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
a bank that would be in trouble so would
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
be either less under capitalized
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
significantly under capitalized
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
critically under capitalized they have
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
specific regulations that limit how much
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
a bank in that situation
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
can pay above the national rate for
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
deposit so that's why I say this is a
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
very important element
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
taking it to the you know the worst
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
extreme if that institution failed and
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
under capitalized institution failed and
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
they just ran up a whole bunch of
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
deposits the FDIC is on the hook to
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
ensure those deposits for up to 250 000
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
at a minimum there's other other
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
elements that they can pay a higher
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
amount so this is the fdic's way of
 
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
saying uh you know we we don't want
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
banks that are in trouble offering more
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
than a certain margin above the national
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
rate because they the FDIC could find
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
themselves in a scenario where they have
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
to pay out on those deposits as the
 
01:18:45.239 --> 01:18:46.310 align:start position:0%
to pay out on those deposits as the
insurer

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:50.300 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that happening but okay
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
let's for discussion purpose of that
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion uh would be to uh
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment uh with the uh that
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
was presented with the last sentence
 
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.510 align:start position:0%
was presented with the last sentence
removed

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
um all those of of the committee the
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh approve of that please

two three four five six seven eight
perfect

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:23.030 align:start position:0%
perfect
okay

01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
do we don't have any Amendment for this
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
one right just this one
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%

o t
p

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
p
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
seven to zip okay
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay this is which one is this one the
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
five minute okay and there's another one
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
so we didn't we didn't have that drawn
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
I know I know okay
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
all right so evidently
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
on 5.95 which I assume nobody has a
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
problem with to begin with
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
right speak now or forevermore hold your
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
peace okay
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
um that there was uh some need for an
 
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.149 align:start position:0%
um that there was uh some need for an
amendment

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:03.770 align:start position:0%
amendment
uh

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh so if people have the bill in front
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
it would be down in Roman numeral five
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh it would delete the
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:29.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
reply and then
 
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.209 align:start position:0%
reply and then
um

01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
further down 6 colon 47
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
advisory committee shall assist and
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
advise that treasure there is no
 
01:21:47.159 --> 01:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
advise that treasure there is no
commissioner

01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
because that was a banking okay so this
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
again you remember this is switching
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
from the bank commissioner to the
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
treasurer and obviously legislative
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay any questions on those two changes
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
okay so it's on it's it's 647 say six
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
colon 47.
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
and down it says Roman numeral two the
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
and again it just
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
it deletes the word commissioner and
 
01:22:28.729 --> 01:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay is anybody

eight okay
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
and next up 6 45
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
there was a new Amendment yeah I know
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
there was a new Amendment so
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
so representative Ammon uh seconded by
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer for discussion
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
um is on the amendment for 6 45 and
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative Emmons recognized to
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
this is another topic related to
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
digital assets
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
um a decentralized autonomous
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
organization there's a there's a bill in
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
the Utah legislature that is copying one
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
from Wyoming so I think we would be the
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth state if we enacted this
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
this approach is a little bit different
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
than the other states
 
01:24:40.739 --> 01:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
than the other states
um

01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
I know this is a big topic and I don't
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
want to get in the weeds too much
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll just tell you about the
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
amendment so we had testimony we had
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
questions that representative you asked
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
some really good questions and that
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
caused a
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
Bill ardinger who also spoke bill was
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
the chair of the digital asset
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
commission he's also been instrumental
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
in rewriting our state's trust laws so
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
he's very knowledgeable he's probably
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
the foremost expert in the state about
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
our Banking and Trust could be right
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
um at least in my opinion he's
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable so
 
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
um this amendment what it did was folded
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
in some existing regulations into the
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
um I could go over those with you if
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
you'd like um
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
let's see how far I can get
 
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.209 align:start position:0%
let's see how far I can get
um

01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
in the finding and the purpose of the
 
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.330 align:start position:0%
in the finding and the purpose of the
ACT

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
ACT
 
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
so that that section I'm looking at page
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
one line 10. people you go on yeah yeah
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
we just got this information just a few
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
hours ago
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I for one kind of enjoy this stuff
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
and would really like to dig into it a
 
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
little bit sure can we wait a couple of
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
days and like give us time to do it okay
 
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.090 align:start position:0%
days and like give us time to do it okay
so

01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
technically I have scheduled everything
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
that was still hanging out there for
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
tomorrow afternoon to exec it
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
we have next week
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
all right at least a weekend and that
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
would give everybody a weekend and that
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
means we would come back next week uh
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
and but I would just so you know that
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
our deadline is next Thursday okay so I
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
would schedule at this point
 
01:26:37.129 --> 01:26:37.139 align:start position:0%
um schedule uh for the morning uh any
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
any anything that we did not have get
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
exact tomorrow and please understand I'm
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
not against this at all no you just want
 
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
the time to look at it
 
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.910 align:start position:0%
the time to look at it
absolutely

01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with that
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
so and then and then so that would be
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
would have a subcommittee in the morning
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Morning of all the anything that
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
was still hanging out there so that
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
theoretically that we would meet again
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
on this issue and then exec it Tuesday
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then we have Wednesday if
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
we still are the press that he is on we
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
could come back Wednesday or and then
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
Thursday if we had to but I'd just like
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
to ask representative Ammon would you
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
prefer doing that rather than retaining
 
01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.450 align:start position:0%
prefer doing that rather than retaining
it

01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
because this is sort of a race between
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
the states I think waiting a year is
 
01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:25.570 align:start position:0%
the states I think waiting a year is
probably

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:25.580 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
we'd fall it behind you know um
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
I understand this is a big issue um
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
but we have uh the expertise of Bill
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
arniger he prepared this uh his
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation he he's in
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
California on a trip of visiting a
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
friend so he wasn't able to make it he
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
had a previously scheduled
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
so really quick if all the things that
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
you don't like about corporations that
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
Capital accrues to a few powerful people
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
that decisions are made behind closed
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
doors right a dow is sort of like the
 
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
answer to that it's it's more of a open
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
transparent process and a way for people
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
to organize collectively but that wasn't
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
the issue right the issue is you just
 
01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:09.860 align:start position:0%
want the time to look at it yeah yeah
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm just we now we're on to the next
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
question representative Burrough saying
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
yeah do we really want to do we really
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
feel pressured to get this done now it's
 
01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
fine just a weekend so representative
 
01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
fine just a weekend so representative
Gibbs

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
um is there some reason we have to do
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Pride that we're we're good
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
enough we're trying to we're trying to
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
show show the rest of the country that
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is the place that you want to do
 
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
business in you want to incorporate in
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
this case I don't know if you use the
 
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
word incorporation okay but if you want
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
to create your business and then and
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
because most businesses are the first
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
thing they'll say is
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
Incorporated under the laws of Delaware
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
or Wyoming or or South Dakota okay so
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
that's who those are our competitors we
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
want we want people to say New Hampshire
 
01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
is out front and and pioneering these
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
alternative critics so just much like we
 
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.610 align:start position:0%
alternative critics so just much like we
did

01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
um B corporations you might be familiar
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
with B corporations
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with that
 
01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:21.860 align:start position:0%
okay so B corporations are actually
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
designed to be more environmental might
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
be more social
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
ESG type companies and that we passed we
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
were one of the first states to create
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
the the B Corp law
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh further question yes for the question
 
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.090 align:start position:0%
uh further question yes for the question
um

01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay I I understand that
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
what if I'm I mean this is a very new
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
area and honestly I find it quite
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
confusing and I'm sure I'm not the only
 
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.229 align:start position:0%
confusing and I'm sure I'm not the only
one

01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:29:51.239 --> 01:29:52.149 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
what if there are other ideas that
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
haven't been thought of and I understand
 
01:29:59.570 --> 01:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
that a lot of work has been done on this
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate it
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
um but what if there are other ideas
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
that haven't been thought of that might
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
come up in other states uh if we might
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
then work on
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know if we wait a little bit
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps sacrifice a little bit of
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
our pride I I honestly that
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
hadn't quite occurred to me but what if
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
there are useful ideas that might be
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
developed that we might be able to use
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
if we were to work on this next year so
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
much like UCC statutes which are model
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that everybody tries to pass
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
yes they're obviously there will be
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of time in the future to revisit
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
it and amend it and include that but the
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
key element was that we would miss out
 
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
on all those businesses who took
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of some other states previous
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the and that even they will have
 
01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to mend their statute
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
to anything these new more creative
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
ideas or other things so yes the idea is
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we want to be we want people to
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
think of nor New Hampshire as the
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
Forefront on these creative
 
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.729 --> 01:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh North Dakota or so it's going to be
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
South Dakota was the the banking was
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
Banky credit card capital of the world
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
so and then and and I'll be frank you
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
know way back when when
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I had sponsored the uniform trust
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
code uh and and
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
um and the the another was it was a
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
uniform when we repealed the rule of
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
perpetuities uh which was a legal term
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
it was basically it's a trust issue and
 
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
it was sort of you know because
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
everybody was saying well Delaware is
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
going to do it so and yeah we were able
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
to beat out Delaware who is the number
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
one uh state for corporations so yeah
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's it's a battle
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
um many years many years ago I think it
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
was a Trivial Pursuit question and uh
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they said they were comparing New
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so which which state is the
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
most the Swiss like where was the
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
Switzerland and it was New Hampshire and
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
I go huh our mountains are not that tall
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
but but it was again it's a idea of
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
Banking and Trust and that kind of
 
01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
financial instrument you know that where
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
we should be out in the Forefront of
 
01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:30.620 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
revisions here since it does address a
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
lot of the concerns were raised before
 
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're there yet but I
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
think we're getting closer to the Finish
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Line you know my concern is is trying to
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
rush it through and having something
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
that is not fully baked get into
 
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
that is not fully baked get into
legislation

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I my concern is trying to rush this
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
through to to a deadline and getting a
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
product that we don't fully like I
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's some wisdom in
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
retaining this trying to put in an
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that fully get us there
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
and have a piece of legislation that
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually fully gets the job done just as
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
something that's occurring to me for the
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
first time as I'm reading it through
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
what does it look like to pierce the
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
corporate veil and I'm using corporate
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
just as a placeholder here which is a
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
major concern how much do we borrow the
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
common law of Corporations and LLCs into
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
this these are things to think about and
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
how does the common law of LLCs and
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
corporations which we borrow back all
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
the way into English common law how does
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
that apply here or are we creating a new
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
common law these are these are things to
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
think about and we need to continue to
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
flesh out these ideas and I don't think
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
we do it in seven days well right we
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to because it's going to go
 
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think we I think we take our time we
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
do it over the summer okay and we can we
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
get the we get the input of of the
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate agencies here and I think
 
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
there's some wisdom as well of putting
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
it to the Secretary of State's office
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
just as we have every other entity or at
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
least talk more about why it is that
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
we're putting it into a new entity
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
I just don't think there's I don't think
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
we need to rush it for the sake of
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
rushing it yeah well I I would not say
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
this was rushed that this has been
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
fairly vetted
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess I can look to the
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
department and see whether they have
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
have feel like they've fully vetted it
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
or not but
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
um you know do we do we have a lot of
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
our town in terms of this being fully
 
01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:42.530 align:start position:0%
our town in terms of this being fully
vetted

01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
I see that we have members of the
 
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
he has to get permission from his boss
 
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
jump Huntley for the Secretary of
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
State's office with deputy secretary of
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
state so just so you want to explain why
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
you understand the role of secretary
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated okay and we're speaking to
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
um Mr hardinger's uh amendment to 645 is
 
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
that yeah he's been discussing okay
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes we have we have um uh
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
reviewed the the amendment um uh
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
certainly the one thing that we that I
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
think is exciting about the bill I
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned here is that we're the first
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
think of thinking outside the box of not
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
doing what rhyming is doing but doing
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
something that's unique that's going to
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of those who have found
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
fault with the way that um that would
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
have been done there
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
um we had a couple of concerns of the
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
bill obviously you mentioned
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation earlier about the sense
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
of Pride
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the bill would create a
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
separate registry of businesses separate
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state is of
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
concern to us I did not realize I was in
 
01:35:51.659 --> 01:35:52.550 align:start position:0%
concern to us I did not realize I was in
here

01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
um that the bill is in terms of the uh
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
the filings would be done with the uh um
 
01:35:59.209 --> 01:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
with the um University of New
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's interoperability lab as
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to filing centrally with where
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
other business of secretary of state is
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
obviously raises numerous questions or
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as you know information
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
availability to the public and
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
um one thing that um I will speak to
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
about the the I think the reason the
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
Wyoming went the route they did is and
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
using for example the existing LLC law
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
was because the the the folks up there
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
had deal with the Practical matters of
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with the outside world
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
when you're not dealing with the
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
internet right if you need to go in if
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
that would open a local bank account
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the the the the Dow needs a good
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
standing it needs documentation some
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
Authority indicating that they really
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
exist and that the
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
um that they have them at the
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
requirements of the statute the statute
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
is unique in how it indicates that that
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
was something self-certify if they meet
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
all these requirements and they state
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they have that now they exist but
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state would have no
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
record of that entity existing because
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be filed with our office so
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
that is one concern that they're
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that we think that the registry
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have now could easily be adapted to
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
handle these types of filings and to the
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
um that was taking advantage of
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
blockchain Technology one of the
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the issues in the
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
governor's commission report was that
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the state government needs to start
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
thinking about how we're going to
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
operate and utilize blockchain
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
technology and certainly this would give
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
um as an agency to play a role in in
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
doing that so I think that the the
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
concerns in the bill
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms of our original concerns
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
about issues like findability you know
 
01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
about issues like findability you know
um

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
if they are if they aren't registered
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state does
 
01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:33.659 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to know where they're
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find information
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
about this business uh and likewise if
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
they don't meet the requirements of the
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
statute such as keeping a legal
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative on record
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
um is there any implications in terms of
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
whether or not they remaining you know
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay so it was the unit unh
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
Apper the interoperability Lab at UNH
 
01:37:59.699 --> 01:38:00.649 align:start position:0%
Apper the interoperability Lab at UNH
um

01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
would be the register would keep the
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
registry according to the statute
 
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
there's an issue that uh
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the governance tokens could be
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
considered Securities and that putting
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
it in the Secretary of State's office
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
might cause a conflict of being able to
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
weigh in you know
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'll phrase this in the form of a
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
question would you believe yeah so do
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
you see any any conflict of the
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State keeping the registry
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any conflict with that
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
our Securities Department already does
 
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.490 align:start position:0%
our Securities Department already does
that

01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
um all Securities are required to be
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
registered with that department but
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
there's also a physical separation of
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
people who do investigations within that
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
same department they don't
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
commingle within that department that
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question well I
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
think he's saying is if when you see it
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
as secretary of state Register
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
the implication is that it's as is a
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
security because you have the security
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
Division and you're saying well that's
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
separate it's a security division is
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
separate but at the same time the whole
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
invention is is they're trying to get
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
out from any government influence any
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
government uh strings attached and
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's why the a non-profit UNH was CR
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know was saying let's have give it
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
to them so that that there was no no
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
connections no similarity to being
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
regulated like a security
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's if this is a
 
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
fair comparison but for example you file
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
a former Corporation you file with the
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State those the chairs are
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
securities uh if you form an LLC the
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
membership interest of that LLC are also
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
security so right now that that coexists
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
right now and since being that
 
01:39:59.930 --> 01:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
Securities Bureau of Securities
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
regulation is a separate division but um
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
the creation of those of those
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
Securities happen by filing a document
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
with our with our office
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
okay so go ahead Keith um so that
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's an idea in the Bill of an
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
accreditation Authority it's the first
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
definition so UNH interoperative
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab that's what they do
 
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
they they review code and they they have
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
a whole Suite of quality assurance tests
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
that they use for networking equipment
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
and the idea was that they could also do
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
quality assurance
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
because the filing is
 
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
really it's about the code that runs the
 
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
Dow it's the open source code and that
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
UNH would have the capacity to do some
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
quality assurance on that code to make
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the bylaws in plain English
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
match up with uh the way the code's
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
written so do you see the Secretary of
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
State's office having that capability
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
in-house at some point in the future
 
01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and how do we you know Bridge those
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
two things
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great question I don't
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
know that that
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
um was that actually in the in the
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that they would perform that
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
function or that they would actually
 
01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
just be the registrar no they have they
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
will develop a suite of tests
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
I have to search for it okay so in other
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
words it's acting as the regulator to
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that that it really was the code
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
was open and was done the way the way it
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is much what the Securities
 
01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:25.820 align:start position:0%
division does
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
maximum transparency for the public
 
01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
right so that they can see everything
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's going on and know where to look
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
for it right no I don't I don't know
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
that we would we would eat and again
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature how do you
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
would Define that but either
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you would say that we would need to
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
develop it in-house or that we would be
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
I do want to add one thing to what Tom
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
said and also reiterate that I think
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's great that New Hampshire is
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
um it's it's going to be coming down and
 
01:41:59.090 --> 01:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of different
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
uses from what everyone realizes is the
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
crypto market now and I think one of the
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
big things that's going to be coming is
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
for accounting purposes just in general
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
um one thing I do want to make sure that
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
this bill or this amendment addresses
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
which I don't see in there now is what
 
01:42:15.719 --> 01:42:16.609 align:start position:0%
which I don't see in there now is what
the

01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
um the governor's commission had
 
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:21.380 align:start position:0%
identified is how how much of
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
decentralization is necessary to be to
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
qualify just to register versus with UNH
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
versus registering with the secretary of
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
state it does mention in the amendment
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
that a Dao can have off-chain assets but
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't limit the percentage of
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
assets that it can have so
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
does this create a different route for
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
what would be traditionally be just a
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
normal New Hampshire company to have a
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
little bit of blockchain Technology
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
within their organization
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
and just register with UNH versus
 
01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.410 align:start position:0%
and just register with UNH versus
um

01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
a traditional rep
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
so it talks about operational and
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
governmental decentralization
 
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
governmental decentralization
um

01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
I guess at this point we're not going to
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
go forward at this moment
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um but I still want to give a week to
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
see if we can resolve these issues
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and and make people more
 
01:43:34.199 --> 01:43:35.149 align:start position:0%
and uh and and make people more
comfortable

01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
so I assume having their blessing make
 
01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
you feel more comfortable
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert having if we can
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
if if representative can work with the
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
second question nobody has even talked
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
about okay and might want to turn your
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
is is a um a new form of corporate
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
structure that is expressly designed to
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
handle cryptocurrency is that not
 
01:44:09.719 --> 01:44:12.709 align:start position:0%
handle cryptocurrency is that not
correct

01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I can answer that yes you go ahead
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
and answer that
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
it's related to the technology that
 
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
underpins cryptocurrency but it's not
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily there's overlap but it's not
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
the same thing so the technology that
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
underpins cryptocurrency which is
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
distributed Ledger technology right
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
allows for people to prove who they are
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
and also interact with the system and so
 
01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:38.420 align:start position:0%
a Dao is a way to
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
allow people to vote on actions that
 
01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
allow people to vote on actions that
govern

01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
govern
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know say a treasury so think of it
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
the simplest form would be a bank
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
account and a question in a chat room is
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency going to be involved in
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
these tracks actions the governance
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
tokens would be based on blockchain
 
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.970 align:start position:0%
tokens would be based on blockchain
technology

01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:57.980 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
not dollars not dollars okay so well my
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
question my point is that we have a uh
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
a monetary Sovereign Financial system
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's based on the dollar and it is
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
always been
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
One Nation one currency
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
so what I'm what disturbs me is that I
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
get this sense and I have a high
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
BS meter that we are I'm looking at a
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
problem in the future where the uh uh
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's going to be a private the
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to basically
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
um legitimize the crypto as a private
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
asset a private dollar that is separate
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
from the dollar and uh that that breaks
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Nation that we have so it could dilute
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
the dollar it's not being you know I
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
know there's a digital bank because
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're I we understand our problem
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're a foundational understand your
 
01:46:14.169 --> 01:46:14.179 align:start position:0%
concerns with crypto technology okay
 
01:46:17.649 --> 01:46:17.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you'll ever be happy but
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll work on this think of it in
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
terms of gold gold news is a private
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
asset that has value that people trade
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
right so yeah we don't do that anymore
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay you can use
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
do you have to turn it into
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
all right representative uh thank you
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
um uh okay let me just
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
um see if I've understood this
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh this is essentially
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
um a somewhat different form of business
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
organization uh that might involve
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency or might not involve
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency it doesn't necessarily
 
01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:00.260 align:start position:0%
involve cryptocurrency it's basically a
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat different form of business
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
organization different from the
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
traditional corporate forum
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
during this week where we review this we
 
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity will you take
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
questions if I have to ask you questions
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
or anything I can just email you and you
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
can you'll be open to that kind of
 
01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.709 align:start position:0%
can you'll be open to that kind of
interaction

01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
01:47:24.719 --> 01:47:31.370 align:start position:0%
interaction
okay

01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
I've been disconnected okay there I am
 
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.390 align:start position:0%
I've been disconnected okay there I am
okay

01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so the way I'm I'm looking at it
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
right at the moment is that
 
01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.430 align:start position:0%
right at the moment is that
representative

01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
clearly demonstrated that he has some
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
concerns uh representative Ammon and
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office will
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
basically have a week to try to resolve
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
these kind of issues and
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
um their proposal from
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state is that this
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
entity from UNH would be a subcontractor
 
01:48:06.129 --> 01:48:06.139 align:start position:0%
who would then delve into that element
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
of looking at the code because clearly
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have that on staff at this
 
01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
moment and that would not necessarily be
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
their task and we nor do we really would
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
want them to go out and hire the people
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
to do that so that that will figure out
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
some kind of language how that might
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
work and and if not then we'll retain
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
the bill but if we can get something
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
come by next week then it might work is
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
that some good Keith
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds good to me I mean yes
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
we could study this till till the cows
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
come home
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
um and and then maybe miss out on an
 
01:48:43.729 --> 01:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our state that would be
 
01:48:43.739 --> 01:48:44.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our state that would be
my

01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
so on Friday we're meeting with the head
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
iol that maybe we could coordinate
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
something for Friday
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
um sit down and hash it out what do you
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
guys think
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll make it work okay
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
with that yes probably didn't feel it uh
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
actually just a suggestion that as as
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking off the top of my head
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps the way to work out the UNH
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
repository and the relationship between
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh the Secretary of State's office would
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
be to in the statute say the Secretary
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
of State or its designee shall be the
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
repository and then an administrative
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
rule appoint the UNH repository as the
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
repository but this avoids in statute
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
using a private organization as the
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
repository but an effect still allowing
 
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.070 align:start position:0%
repository but an effect still allowing
foreign

01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
language yeah I think okay and that also
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
allows the nibleness to not use UNH in
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
the future yeah exactly it could be
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
somebody else right
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly okay all right we'll move
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.159 --> 01:49:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
now we go to a whole new realm of the
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
type of problems okay first up is uh HB
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
173 uh now this one aren't we retaining
 
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:02.900 align:start position:0%
this the toilet numbers and public the
 
01:50:10.689 --> 01:50:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we want to retain yeah retained
 
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.850 align:start position:0%
yeah we want to retain yeah retained
okay

01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%

01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
all right P fast in carpets 465.
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:32.420 align:start position:0%
you're going in in numeric order yeah
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just going from my spreadsheet that
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
I did uh late one night just to comment
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
on this the uh the feds are apparently
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
coming out very soon with a uh a
 
01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
statement on pfas yeah it's exactly the
 
01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
Rainy answer in the end of the day is
 
01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
that this is a federal issue in pfas so
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we're okay with retaining 465
 
01:50:59.530 --> 01:50:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%

01:51:05.209 --> 01:51:05.219 align:start position:0%
because you all have it on numerical
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
order oh I see uh she put them in there
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%

representative hunt seconded by
 
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative uh McAleer
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh when we moved itl
 
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
280 the freeze-dried because uh she did
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
when she realized that government was
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
going to be heavy heavy-handed she she
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
did not want to go there
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay any questions on the Ito okay
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
oh everybody and the subcommittee is
 
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
about to vote representative hunt
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative macular moose
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh in expedient to legislate on HB 280
 
01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
any discussion from the subcommittee
 
01:53:58.209 --> 01:53:58.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
we will will
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
essentially this was trying to allow
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
people who are um home making
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
um food products at their house
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
um essentially being able to grow their
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
own stuff and be able to freeze dry it
 
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
for preservation purposes and so but to
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
sell it at the end of the day that's the
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
key question which you know is it was
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
that they want to sell it so you know
 
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
you can do anything you want in your own
 
01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:24.770 align:start position:0%
you can do anything you want in your own
kitchen

01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
but if you want to make it available you
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know and sell it then you have to
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
know you are going to get regulated by
 
01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:48.129 align:start position:0%
know you are going to get regulated by
HHS

01:54:48.129 --> 01:54:48.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.139 --> 01:54:50.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:50.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
any more requested representative
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay so we do kill bills uniformly we
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
all agree okay
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh so uh for the subcommittee all those
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
who are in support of the itl motion
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand one two three
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight okay
 
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.950 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight okay
zip

01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
zip
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
um yes represent Gibbs
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
two uh first of all my apologies when I
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
asked what happened to 6 45 I meant what
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
happened to 173 and 242. okay so 173
 
01:55:34.609 --> 01:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
we're going to retain that because we
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
want to wait till after they have
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
revised the Boca
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
and at that point uh we were recommended
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
by the department to
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
um then actually delete the whole RSA
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
which is always fun to do
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
but but he's we're not going to do that
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
until after the toilet facilities one
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
that was the toy yeah okay and then 242
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
pfas and food packaging and and we're
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to retain that because an
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
expectation that the federal government
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
is going to start ruling uh they will
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
Their Food Food and Drug is going to
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
have that makes sense thank you okay
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
1 15.
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing candidates on the
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
moderator for the candidates tonight so
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've got to be out of there by two
 
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:41.090 align:start position:0%
we've got to be out of there by two
o'clock

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know we voted that bill down
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
last week I think that some Republicans
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
that understand that it's a
 
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:54.609 align:start position:0%
that understand that it's a
anti-business

01:56:54.609 --> 01:56:54.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.619 --> 01:56:56.410 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:56:56.410 --> 01:56:56.420 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think is going on
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
the Republicans lost a bunch of stuff
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
last week because they didn't show up
 
01:57:03.719 --> 01:57:04.910 align:start position:0%
last week because they didn't show up
right

01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:07.340 align:start position:0%
they had a meeting influence in which
 
01:57:11.050 --> 01:57:11.060 align:start position:0%
Osborne yelled his head off early yes
 
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
he's been known to kick people off of
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
committees if they don't hold him as
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
well so I think when this film comes up
 
01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
next week if it did come up
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
I think he would force them to vote the
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can hold it up for at least long
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
enough to build up some consensus I hope
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
you're right because I think that you
 
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
know Ito but it could still go out I
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
understand I understand
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
but I want to have more time to get past
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
this this thing where they they're very
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
I hope you're right
 
01:57:59.649 --> 01:57:59.659 align:start position:0%
or wrong
 
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
the less chance they have of building up
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
something for it excellent I I got a
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of articles on ESG you're
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
right about and all of it I absolutely
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
happened I mean this is really a
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
this is just like CRT
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
no it is
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
in that it's such a political thing that
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know well spear then would have been
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
that they would stick it into the uh
 
01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
that they would stick it into the uh
budget

01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
if we retain it at least they can't do
 
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.290 align:start position:0%
if we retain it at least they can't do
that

01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
so here's the question do I stick around
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
for this afternoon or not
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
and do I come in tomorrow morning
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
are you just in the business in the
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
business one yeah
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna stick around because I really
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
care about pdab
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
about what uh the uh do you have
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
oh it doesn't come up no that's not on
 
01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I think we can go home
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
and then I mean I don't care about any
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I really care about these two
 
01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:17.810 align:start position:0%
yeah I really care about these two
yeah

01:59:17.810 --> 01:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
you can't vote on them can't vote but I
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
can say some stuff you can say whatever
 
01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.219 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah I'm gonna stick around
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
just because if I hear the inceptivity
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
is Obsession you give me a better idea
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
that makes sense Anita I'm thinking of
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
not showing up until 1 15 tomorrow what
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and I'm not on the this
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%

we did I did have a handout I know
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
technically we're not supposed to do a
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
handout but I wanted to make sure that
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
everybody understood the 177 colon 8
 
03:34:11.090 --> 03:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
which leads the historical fund the
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
language that the Liquor Commission
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
follows the last revamp in that was done
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
in 2018.
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
and secondly on the second page this is
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
just a quick little synopsis breakdown
 
03:34:26.809 --> 03:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
on the two pages highlighted in the lime
 
03:34:29.570 --> 03:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
yellow of the gross profit of all the
 
03:34:32.210 --> 03:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
bottles that we've done uh since we
 
03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
started under Governor Hassan when we
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
started these along with Senator Waters
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
at the time we did the first uh
 
03:34:45.410 --> 03:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
rendition of New Hampshire bottles
 
03:34:47.570 --> 03:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
and we have done
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
seven to date
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
pretty much all sold out at this point
 
03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
and then on the last page is the is the
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
first CAD drawing of the next bottle
 
03:35:00.349 --> 03:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
that we were that we're planning on
 
03:35:00.359 --> 03:35:01.370 align:start position:0%
that we were that we're planning on
doing

03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
which is the Cannon Mountain bottle
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be more detail there'll
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually be the hook on the top of the
 
03:35:10.250 --> 03:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
tram that holds it and there'll be more
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
detail but that's the first one that
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
they could send me and that one is in
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the process of being priced out for us
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
now and just for the for the uh for the
 
03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
record we did send a letter this morning
 
03:35:26.210 --> 03:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
which I said that I would draft and send
 
03:35:29.330 --> 03:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
at our last historical meeting to the
 
03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Brokers Association uh I'm
 
03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
sorry the New Hampshire distillers
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
Association it was emailed to Brian
 
03:35:40.670 --> 03:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
Ferguson this morning as to asking them
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
if there would be any interest from a
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Distillery to represent
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
the bottle after this
 
03:35:52.010 --> 03:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh Cannon bottle and or at least
 
03:35:54.889 --> 03:35:54.899 align:start position:0%
allowing us to fill whatever the next
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
bottle would be with New Hampshire
 
03:35:59.450 --> 03:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
products so we left it open to them if
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
they'd like to design and fill that's
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
fine or if they'd just like to have
 
03:36:06.410 --> 03:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
someone else design and then they could
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
fill with their product so we would put
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire distilled
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
product in the next one and I know that
 
03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:14.349 align:start position:0%
product in the next one and I know that
20

03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
26 was a date that was discussed in the
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
in the committee as to the
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
250th anniversary of the United States
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
and have that uh have that New Hampshire
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
Liquor in that bottle or or prior to
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do one a year at
 
03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
this point it takes between the design
 
03:36:36.769 --> 03:36:36.779 align:start position:0%
the fill the shipping it takes about a
 
03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
year to do a bottle so
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
so I want to be happy to take any
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone might have
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question about the Canon
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
tram did you check with the governor
 
03:36:56.929 --> 03:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
first before you put that out
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
why you want to see a six-seater there
 
03:37:01.370 --> 03:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
oh no no I just I'm glad that they're
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
going to be restoring you know the tram
 
03:37:06.650 --> 03:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
and I think that's was kind of the idea
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
behind it to the historical nature of
 
03:37:11.570 --> 03:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
the tram and and all the folks that have
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
visited New Hampshire that have you know
 
03:37:15.530 --> 03:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of taking that ride
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully they would be interested in
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
buying a purchasing a bottle yep thanks
 
03:37:22.610 --> 03:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah based on this picture it
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
looks like it needs a little repair I
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
see the roof rooftop is here
 
03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
wow the first CAD drawings are usually a
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
little rough I think there was a lot of
 
03:37:35.769 --> 03:37:35.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay okay so is uh anybody have any
 
03:37:41.210 --> 03:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
questions and the the purpose of this
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is actually just uh the fund
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
itself that and how it's a dedicated
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
fund which is somewhat controversial
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
these dedicated funds but um in this
 
03:37:54.290 --> 03:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
case I don't think this you know too
 
03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
much question that
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission runs on funds
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
anyways in terms of the different money
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
where the monies go and in this case we
 
03:38:04.849 --> 03:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
at least we're uh the history committee
 
03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
which I am now a member of and that's
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
how I got stuck being the sponsor of
 
03:38:12.410 --> 03:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh is um you know is where
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
the money goes to the hall of flags
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
which is our important restoration
 
03:38:18.050 --> 03:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
project so
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
s or flags and now it's going to the
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
historic fund well no well it is that
 
03:38:34.610 --> 03:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're identifying an actual Fund in
 
03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
terms of targeting the revenue okay so
 
03:38:40.010 --> 03:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
it just it was it's where it's just
 
03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:41.269 align:start position:0%
it just it was it's where it's just
moving

03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
pieces around just where the hell the
 
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
cash flow what's the funds so
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it just it gives it it gives the
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
history committee a little more control
 
03:38:49.800 --> 03:38:51.050 align:start position:0%
history committee a little more control
over

03:38:51.050 --> 03:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
um dedicated and what they do with the
 
03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:53.450 align:start position:0%
um dedicated and what they do with the
Monies

03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
Monies
 
03:38:53.460 --> 03:38:54.590 align:start position:0%
Monies
so

03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
and um just to follow up on that it will
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
go to some historic
 
03:38:59.279 --> 03:39:00.050 align:start position:0%
go to some historic
um

03:39:00.050 --> 03:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
it'll be designated for a historic
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
purpose it's in the historic fund yeah
 
03:39:05.330 --> 03:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
so that's what the committee does yeah
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's what's
 
03:39:10.490 --> 03:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
I only joined it so I can get it go up
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
take up a lot of time but I just wanted
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
to let everybody know that many years
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
ago when my parents were still alive and
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
able to travel uh they came to visit me
 
03:39:26.330 --> 03:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
several times in New Hampshire and I
 
03:39:29.330 --> 03:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
took them to many interesting places
 
03:39:31.010 --> 03:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things that actually
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
impressed them the most was the Hall of
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
flex in the state house uh it is
 
03:39:38.210 --> 03:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
definitely worth preserving I I think so
 
03:39:41.090 --> 03:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
too all right great thank you
 
03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the subcommunity
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
for two SEC Walsh Osborne's not here uh
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
Burroughs Sullivan
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
below and Vincent's not here so that's
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay is uh all those in uh in favor of
 
03:40:06.130 --> 03:40:06.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
fix it okay
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
I think you should consider though
 
03:40:18.530 --> 03:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
having something like Stephen Tyler from
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
Arrowsmith who's from New Hampshire I
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
think you should have a bottle with his
 
03:40:28.610 --> 03:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:30.650 --> 03:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
certainly take that under consideration
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I have a lot of
 
03:40:34.130 --> 03:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
other ideas
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.479 --> 03:40:40.729 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:40.729 --> 03:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:45.050 --> 03:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:45.060 --> 03:40:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
.

03:40:51.410 --> 03:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.420 --> 03:41:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
I guess am I the only one that has the
 
03:41:05.570 --> 03:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
amendment do you have the Aiden's last
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
and latest rendition thank you chairman
 
03:41:10.729 --> 03:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
I do not have an official copy of the
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe you're the only one
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
get myself into trouble here you are in
 
03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:23.570 align:start position:0%
get myself into trouble here you are in
trouble

03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.490 --> 03:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
so I can ignore that right
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're good so however
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
I might need you to run over to
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
legislative services so let's see what I
 
03:41:43.610 --> 03:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:43.620 --> 03:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.960 --> 03:41:53.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:41:53.050 --> 03:41:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.969 --> 03:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:42:00.170 --> 03:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
I got it five hours ago
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm gonna
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're you're here to talk about this
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
new Amendment right
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay do you have the amendment
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
I Have A draft copy that was given to
 
03:42:19.849 --> 03:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
well maybe I actually I actually have
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
the legislative Services one so I'm
 
03:42:28.210 --> 03:42:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
and for a seven
 
03:42:31.319 --> 03:42:32.990 align:start position:0%
and for a seven
okay

03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%

03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do it okay I just sent it
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%

03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:40.790 align:start position:0%
it's still saying sending stay stay
tuned

03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
tuned
 
03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:54.170 align:start position:0%
tuned
okay

03:42:54.170 --> 03:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.849 --> 03:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
did you get it
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
again I know it's I know there's a
 
03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time where my
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
email address which is Prodigy
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
which I like to tell people is older
 
03:43:10.490 --> 03:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
than AOL
 
03:43:12.530 --> 03:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
though I couldn't get anything through
 
03:43:14.090 --> 03:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission
 
03:43:16.250 --> 03:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
they they could send it but it would
 
03:43:22.370 --> 03:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.570 --> 03:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
something's wrong with our email address
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
what it turned out to be it was it was
 
03:43:32.330 --> 03:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
conquered it was the conquered internet
 
03:43:32.340 --> 03:43:33.710 align:start position:0%
conquered it was the conquered internet
provider

03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:43:36.530 --> 03:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
it was they they just they just anything
 
03:43:39.050 --> 03:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
with prodigy
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the only reason I figured that out
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
is because I was I was on the board of
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
healthy kids and they couldn't send
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%

don't go anywhere okay so the next one
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
um is 544 which um I think we should

03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.450 --> 03:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
yes right oh yeah I do have someone who
 
03:44:41.809 --> 03:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
might have opposition Origins
 
03:44:46.190 --> 03:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:51.710 align:start position:0%
 
really

03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Walsh is that
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.960 --> 03:45:02.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:45:02.929 --> 03:45:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:02.939 --> 03:45:05.630 align:start position:0%

03:45:06.899 --> 03:45:09.969 align:start position:0%
all right
so

03:45:09.969 --> 03:45:09.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
we have no we don't have a second
 
03:45:17.330 --> 03:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
well you know what the vote's going to
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
be right if
 
03:45:25.190 --> 03:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative bitusek
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Burroughs uh
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
moves to retain
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 544 any discussion on the
 
03:45:32.760 --> 03:45:37.010 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 544 any discussion on the
motion

03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.210 --> 03:45:40.220 align:start position:0%
would you really like me to discuss this
 
03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're that this is your your window of
 
03:45:47.929 --> 03:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity well I just like uh hb639 I
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
feel that this is Ron for New Hampshire
 
03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
it's not going to bring in the millions
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
of dollars that people think it is and
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
I've got all sorts of data it's which I
 
03:45:59.830 --> 03:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
had already spoken to on the house floor
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so I feel that this is you know the
 
03:46:04.130 --> 03:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
other half of the bill and I feel
 
03:46:05.929 --> 03:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
strongly about it as well
 
03:46:09.050 --> 03:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on the motion
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none all those in favor of
 
03:46:18.769 --> 03:46:18.779 align:start position:0%
retaining and raise your hand
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
03:46:21.479 --> 03:46:23.090 align:start position:0%
one two three
four

03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right and all those opposed
 
03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:30.410 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right and all those opposed
what

03:46:30.410 --> 03:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.420 --> 03:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
because we're missing Vincent or uh
 
03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
no you you Jane I didn't see your hand
 
03:46:39.530 --> 03:46:39.540 align:start position:0%

it's five five to one it's five don't
 
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
five to one
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:48.889 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:46:48.889 --> 03:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:50.809 --> 03:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
um Joe do you guys want to talk about
 
03:46:54.769 --> 03:46:54.779 align:start position:0%
the changes that are in the amendment
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
before we actually have a copy of it
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah and thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:03.769 --> 03:47:03.779 align:start position:0%
and committee members I'm Lieutenant
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
Matthew Culver from the New Hampshire
 
03:47:06.290 --> 03:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission division of
 
03:47:08.530 --> 03:47:08.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
during our last meeting when the this
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
bill was proposed a couple questions
 
03:47:18.889 --> 03:47:18.899 align:start position:0%
came up in reference to RSA 17923
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph four
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is addressing
 
03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:24.290 align:start position:0%
this is addressing
um

03:47:24.290 --> 03:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
the changes made to when an affidavit is
 
03:47:30.650 --> 03:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
required and the designation of a person
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
in charge
 
03:47:37.370 --> 03:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
since the repeal and requirement of a uh
 
03:47:39.370 --> 03:47:39.380 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
03:47:42.410 --> 03:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
to go through the Felon approval process
 
03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:44.330 align:start position:0%
to go through the Felon approval process
uh

03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that rip that legislation had been
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
previously repealed so this language is
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
just cleaning up exactly when an
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit is required by ownership who
 
03:47:58.130 --> 03:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
that is submitted to and the process in
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
which a person is designated as a person
 
03:48:04.250 --> 03:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
so I realized through the members we
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't have this in front of us so we're
 
03:48:09.650 --> 03:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure what they're saying but
 
03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
so we'll obviously wait until we get
 
03:48:14.570 --> 03:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
that so go ahead for the next piece
 
03:48:17.210 --> 03:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
great the next section is uh in
 
03:48:19.729 --> 03:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
reference to RSA 17821
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph two A4
 
03:48:22.080 --> 03:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
paragraph two A4
and

03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
the original Bill had left out as as the
 
03:48:29.650 --> 03:48:29.660 align:start position:0%
members may recall New Hampton
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the dry towns of Newington New
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampton and landaf so when legislative
 
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
Services put out the original Bill New
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
Hampton was left off of that it is added
 
03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
back into it as a result of this
 
03:48:45.540 --> 03:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
back into it as a result of this
amendment

03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay we talked about that yep
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
the next section is uh in reference to
 
03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 17956 and I will let deputy chief
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair and as you know with all
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
these bills or all these perspective uh
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
within this bill all these prospective
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
statutes as from inception of this
 
03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
Administration we have
 
03:49:22.190 --> 03:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes tripped over changes that
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
weren't intentionally made but but ended
 
03:49:28.010 --> 03:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
up being made in legislative services to
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
no fault of anybody but they were just
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
they needed to be cleaned up so there's
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
been conversations outside the room of
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
why this has come up now and they're
 
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's just clean up we're just cleaning
 
03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:42.779 align:start position:0%
up some of the stuff that fell a little
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
short over the years
 
03:49:47.150 --> 03:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay
 
03:49:49.250 --> 03:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
um again the next section is RSA 17956
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
this language you'll see actually
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
um under title 13 we have Provisions
 
03:50:01.370 --> 03:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
regarding hearings but we are also
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
governed by the administrative procedure
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
act which is in 541a
 
03:50:07.969 --> 03:50:07.979 align:start position:0%
this actually just cleans up confusing
 
03:50:10.250 --> 03:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
language between the two
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
um there's you'll see that some of the
 
03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
language has been redacted and I just
 
03:50:18.530 --> 03:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
want to clarify so the language that is
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
redacted is except it's provided in
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
subparagraph C the commission shall not
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
suspend or revoke a license until the
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
licensee has been provided to hearing
 
03:50:28.370 --> 03:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
under RSA 541a
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
the licensee will always have due
 
03:50:33.469 --> 03:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
process this doesn't change the process
 
03:50:35.330 --> 03:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
of the licensee this doesn't change due
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
process the reason that we're asking for
 
03:50:40.010 --> 03:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
this language to be redacted is because
 
03:50:42.769 --> 03:50:42.779 align:start position:0%
there is confusion with that and with
 
03:50:46.370 --> 03:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph C sub paragraph C allows
 
03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
for 24-Hour suspension of the license
 
03:50:51.170 --> 03:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
without a hearing that is when an
 
03:50:53.210 --> 03:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
emergency is happening when there's a
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
danger to public health safety or
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
welfare it doesn't mean that the action
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
of the licensee is an emergency
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
where this has been applied in the past
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
has been a riot situation you know in a
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
college town where everybody's coming
 
03:51:07.550 --> 03:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
out of the establishments with glass
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
bottles or or glasses and we want to say
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
we need people to stop serving there's
 
03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
an emergency happening there's no
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
punitive action we just need to get
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
everything under control before you can
 
03:51:19.849 --> 03:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
continue to serve
 
03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
in 541a 33
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
that allows for an immediate suspension
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the license for emergency action that
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
means there has been an action by the
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
licensee that is a risk to public health
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
safety or welfare where this is applied
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
is the fatalities
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
so this just cleans up the confusion of
 
03:51:42.050 --> 03:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
an immediate suspension versus an
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
emergency suspension it just makes the
 
03:51:46.130 --> 03:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
license clearer for the public and the
 
03:51:46.140 --> 03:51:49.849 align:start position:0%
license clearer for the public and the
licensee

03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.530 --> 03:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it back over to
 
03:52:07.729 --> 03:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and that brings us to the last
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
section which is uh on this document on
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
section six section six on page two
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
director consumers shipments of alcohol
 
03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
and and two New Hampshire residents
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 178
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
um 27 B there's a typo there 178 27b
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and last legislative session uh this
 
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
particular law was was changed new
 
03:52:43.010 --> 03:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
language was drafted and what was
 
03:52:46.190 --> 03:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen was paragraph
 
03:52:49.010 --> 03:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
one A B and C were to be split out just
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
like it is here
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
and paragraphs two through six were to
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
be repealed
 
03:52:56.570 --> 03:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
when it made its way through the
 
03:52:56.580 --> 03:52:58.929 align:start position:0%
when it made its way through the
legislators

03:52:58.929 --> 03:52:58.939 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
paragraphs two through six were not
 
03:53:04.130 --> 03:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
repealed out of that legislation this is
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
just fixing it with the to what the
 
03:53:14.769 --> 03:53:14.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I believe this was your bill
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure you're
 
03:53:19.260 --> 03:53:21.469 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure you're
familiar

03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
03:53:23.410 --> 03:53:23.420 align:start position:0%
Yeah well yeah I am
 
03:53:28.729 --> 03:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
it basically had to do with the um
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
the limits on the quantities of uh being
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
able to be directly delivered to
 
03:53:39.650 --> 03:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
Consumers right and the reporting
 
03:53:39.660 --> 03:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
Consumers right and the reporting
requirements

03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
the limits correct okay
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
so for the new members
 
03:53:46.800 --> 03:53:49.250 align:start position:0%
so for the new members
um

03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:52.130 --> 03:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
actually one of the reasons why uh this
 
03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
committee now does liquor
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
is uh many many many moons ago
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
um I sat down I actually uh I was
 
03:54:04.370 --> 03:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
getting beer Across America and I was
 
03:54:07.130 --> 03:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
had to go to the UPS to get my beer and
 
03:54:09.650 --> 03:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh the case and and they were trying to
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
convince me there was a statute that
 
03:54:13.130 --> 03:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
said they couldn't couldn't give us the
 
03:54:16.010 --> 03:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
beer give me my beer and I go oh yeah
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
really I'm a legislator tell me what
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
that RSA is well they he had a little
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
trouble copying that one up but uh
 
03:54:24.290 --> 03:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's what I learned about department
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
rules and how rules sometimes uh can uh
 
03:54:31.070 --> 03:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes get in the way so I I called
 
03:54:33.710 --> 03:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
up the electric commission John Byrne at
 
03:54:34.729 --> 03:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
that time
 
03:54:38.269 --> 03:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
and uh John and I sat down and and he
 
03:54:40.610 --> 03:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
says you know I really don't have a
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
problem with direct shipping especially
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
with beer because that was that was a
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
beer distributor problem but he was he
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
all he says all we care about it was
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
wine is that is that we don't want
 
03:54:52.849 --> 03:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
anybody to think that that would be the
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
only way they can get their wine is to
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
Direct ship it we still want them to
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
sell it through the commission so so
 
03:55:01.130 --> 03:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
once we had got over that he wanted to
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that no one could you know
 
03:55:04.969 --> 03:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
that after a certain point you had to
 
03:55:06.769 --> 03:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
they had to make the wine available to
 
03:55:09.170 --> 03:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
the commission then we were we were
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
running and uh so we were one of the
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
pioneer states to have allowed direct
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
shipping allow California wines to come
 
03:55:17.570 --> 03:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and much so that I I went to the
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
ncsl conferences and the the uh the way
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
the wine the wine Coalition they kept
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
they used my bill they were promoting it
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get all these other states to
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
to take on the same concept
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and then when I got back to New
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that at that time uh the new
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
speaker Donna scitec says you know John
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think maybe she wanted to get rid of
 
03:55:44.929 --> 03:55:44.939 align:start position:0%
the regulated revenues committee so she
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
said I think the Commerce Committee
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
should have should have had the liquor
 
03:55:50.689 --> 03:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
laws and uh and then we go running
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and that was I'll find it any for
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
many years we brought in a fair amount
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
of money over the years and then uh when
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
covet hit uh the issue again now came up
 
03:56:04.490 --> 03:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
is what about in-state and whether
 
03:56:07.150 --> 03:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
somebody should be able to get the wine
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
or the liquor or the beer sent to the
 
03:56:13.849 --> 03:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
directly to their home and that's what
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
this statute is for this is sort of the
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.849 --> 03:56:24.859 align:start position:0%
and I I did get my beer from the UPS
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
but I don't know beer Across America are
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
they still on the list are they still
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
they still do business are you we still
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
could do beer across America
 
03:56:36.530 --> 03:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
the only uh care they have to be like a
 
03:56:38.929 --> 03:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
licensed carrier so UPS FedEx and FedEx
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the delivery but I'm saying is they
 
03:56:42.650 --> 03:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
still a vendor with our direct shipping
 
03:56:46.729 --> 03:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
loan there's 1390 of them now so I I
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
would have to check on that which is a
 
03:56:50.210 --> 03:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
Marvel when you think about that that
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
all these entities 13 you know are are
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
signing up to uh to to ship into New
 
03:56:56.880 --> 03:56:58.130 align:start position:0%
signing up to uh to to ship into New
Hampshire

03:56:58.130 --> 03:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and you know you have someone you
 
03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
might walk into a winery in California
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
or New York or somewhere and actually
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
not New York right then New York still
 
03:57:08.330 --> 03:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
that was the Graham decision they were
 
03:57:10.610 --> 03:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
correct New York but it has been
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
tremendously successful yes
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's over a million dollars a
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
there you go there you go
 
03:57:32.210 --> 03:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
what what is the process I'm just kind
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
of curious now because I was uh in Texas
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
back around Halloween time and I went to
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
this farmer's market and it was like
 
03:57:40.439 --> 03:57:41.150 align:start position:0%
this farmer's market and it was like
this

03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
amazing wine they were giving those
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
samples to and he's like yeah we'll ship
 
03:57:46.130 --> 03:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
it to you and I told them listen to him
 
03:57:47.809 --> 03:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
we can't ship to New Hampshire
 
03:57:49.490 --> 03:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
so is that not accurate or do they have
 
03:57:51.650 --> 03:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
to go through some process thank you for
 
03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
the question uh representative and yes
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
they have to go through the licensing
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
process so for out-of-state
 
03:57:59.450 --> 03:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
manufacturers out of state wineries they
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
would apply for a direct shipping permit
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
directly through the state of New
 
03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:04.030 align:start position:0%
directly through the state of New
Hampshire

03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:58:06.290 --> 03:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
upon issuance then they would be
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
authorized to utilize a carrier to
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
Direct ship that product directly to a
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.370 --> 03:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
what's the cost for the like that
 
03:58:16.380 --> 03:58:18.889 align:start position:0%
what's the cost for the like that

03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's a it's on a tiered
 
03:58:23.929 --> 03:58:23.939 align:start position:0%
um structure based on whether you're a
 
03:58:26.450 --> 03:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
retailer or a manufacturer
 
03:58:26.460 --> 03:58:27.309 align:start position:0%
retailer or a manufacturer
um

03:58:27.309 --> 03:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that off the top of my
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
head but 220 it's not much correct yes
 
03:58:34.969 --> 03:58:34.979 align:start position:0%
it's very recent and then if you only
 
03:58:37.490 --> 03:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
ship once I don't know if that was still
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
still in the statute but if you could
 
03:58:40.910 --> 03:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
get your money back if you only make one
 
03:58:44.689 --> 03:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
shipment that's correct you do so
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that I think I negotiated that
 
03:58:51.050 --> 03:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
when we did uh putting names on kegs
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
keg registration The Keg registration I
 
03:58:56.570 --> 03:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
was able to get get that if you're if
 
03:58:58.490 --> 03:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
you were it was a one-off
 
03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
then they could get their money back for
 
03:59:01.969 --> 03:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
the actual registration
 
03:59:04.250 --> 03:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
so but they still have to collect the
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
John Hunt Memorial eight percent tax yes
 
03:59:08.269 --> 03:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
they do
 
03:59:12.769 --> 03:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis due by the 15th
 
03:59:12.779 --> 03:59:14.330 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis due by the 15th
so

03:59:14.330 --> 03:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee on
 
03:59:20.330 --> 03:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.889 --> 03:59:21.899 align:start position:0%
to answer your question specifically
 
03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative the wine manufacturers
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
pay a hundred dollars uh for the permit
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
fee the importers retailers and
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:35.330 --> 03:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
if I wanted somebody else
 
03:59:37.010 --> 03:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
question yep for the question so if I
 
03:59:39.290 --> 03:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
wanted that guy from Texas to ship me
 
03:59:40.729 --> 03:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
his wine he'd have to pay a hundred
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
dollars but he'd only ever shipped it to
 
03:59:43.610 --> 03:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
me then he'd get that hundred dollars
 
03:59:43.620 --> 03:59:45.050 align:start position:0%
me then he'd get that hundred dollars
back

03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
if he's only making that one shipment
 
03:59:49.130 --> 03:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
correct as a wine manufacturer that's
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.969 --> 03:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
but it's hard time to convince people
 
03:59:58.130 --> 03:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
things like that you know yeah yeah
 
04:00:01.130 --> 04:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
there's a lot for that what
 
04:00:04.490 --> 04:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
trust me trust me
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%

04:02:53.710 --> 04:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.150 --> 04:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
